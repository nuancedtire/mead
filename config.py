‚è±Ô∏è A once-weekly insulin matching daily doses‚Äîcould this revolutionize type 2 diabetes management?

In the QWINT-2 phase 3 trial, once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa showed:

üìä A1C reduction of 1.34% compared to 1.26% with daily insulin degludec, resulting in A1C levels of 6.87% and 6.95% respectively at 52 weeks.

‚è∞ An extra 45 minutes in target glucose range per day without an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

üõ°Ô∏è A safety profile comparable to daily insulins, with no severe hypoglycemic events reported for efsitora.

Could once-weekly dosing enhance adherence and lessen the treatment burden for your patients?""",
