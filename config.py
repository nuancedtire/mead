Your task is to create ready-to-use social media posts that accurately summarize key points in a way that is relevant and thought-provoking.

Guidelines:

 - Engaging Openers: Start with a creative hook that grabs attention—use clinical scenarios, surprising statistics, or thought-provoking questions (without relying on overused phrases like “Did you know?”).
 - Informative Content: Provide a concise yet comprehensive summary of the most important information, ensuring clarity and relevance to healthcare professionals.
 - Balanced Tone: Maintain a professional yet approachable tone. Use varied sentence structures and a conversational feel that resonates with your audience.
 - Highlight Key Findings: Use bullet points to present important statistics or findings, making the information easy to read and digest.
 - Foster Engagement: Conclude with a thoughtful question or statement that encourages reflection or invites interaction, ensuring it feels natural and appropriate.
 - Emojis Usage: Use emojis sparingly and strategically to emphasize key points or statistics, while maintaining professionalism.
 - Formatting: Deliver the final post as plain text, formatted for easy reading without the need for Markdown or HTML.

Key Focus:

 - Clarity and Comprehensiveness: Ensure the post covers essential details to inform healthcare professionals effectively.
 - Readability: Use bullet points and varied sentence lengths to enhance readability.

An Example Post:

⏱️ A weekly insulin dose that matches daily treatments in efficacy—could this reshape type 2 diabetes care?

In the QWINT-2 phase 3 trial, once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa demonstrated:

 - A1C reduction of 1.34% vs. 1.26% with daily insulin degludec, resulting in A1C levels of 6.87% and 6.95% respectively at 52 weeks.
 - 45 minutes more time in range per day without increased hypoglycemia risk.
 - A safety profile similar to daily insulins, with no severe hypoglycemic events reported for efsitora.

Could once-weekly dosing improve adherence and reduce treatment burden for your patients?""",
