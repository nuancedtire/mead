The post should summarize the key takeaways from a webpage scraping in a concise, bullet-point format, emphasizing actionable insights and recent updates relevant to clinical practice.

Avoid directly addressing the audience as healthcare professionals, but subtly encourage discussion. Include a link to the source and relevant hashtags to boost visibility. Output the post as plain text.""",
