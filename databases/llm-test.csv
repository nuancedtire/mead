The FDA has granted Priority Review Designation to SpringWorks Therapeutics and accepted its New Drug Application for mirdametinib to treat adult and pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN).

The investigational MEK inhibitor has been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of February 28, 2025. The rare genetic disorder arises from loss-of-function variants in the NF1 gene, which encodes for neurofibromin, a key suppressor of the MAPK pathway. There is an estimated global birth incidence of approximately 1 in 2,500 individuals, and approximately 100,000 patients living with NF1 in the United States.

""NF1 patients have approximately a 30-50% lifetime risk of developing plexiform neurofibromas, or PN, which are tumors that grow in an infiltrative pattern along the peripheral nerve sheath and that can cause severe disfigurement, pain and functional impairment; in rare cases, NF1-PN may be fatal,"" stated Spring Works.

Submission to the FDA included data from the phase 2b ReNeu trial (NCT03962543) evaluating mirdametinib in patients aged 2 years or older with NF1-associated PN causing significant morbidity. Results, presented in an oral presentation at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, demonstrated that mirdametinib objective response rates, improvement in pain and health-related quality of life, along with a ""manageable safety profile across both the adult and pediatric cohorts,"" according to SpringWorks.

The trial enrolled 114 patients to receive mirdametinib at a dose of 2 mg / m2 twice daily without regard to food. It was administered orally in a 3-week on, 1-week off dosing schedule as either a capsule or dispersible tablet.

The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate assessed by proportion of patients with a 20% or greater reduction in target tumor volume on consecutive scans in a 24 cycle treatment phase, measured by MRI.

""People living with NF1-PN are in need of new advances and we look forward to working with the FDA and EMA during their review processes as we prepare to bring our second medicine to patients suffering from devastating diseases,"" said Saqib Islam, Chief Executive Officer of SpringWorks, in the press release.

‚ÄúPlexiform neurofibromas may sit next to or surround vital organs and can cause serious medical complications for patients. While progress has been made, there remains a pressing need for more treatment options, particularly for adults who currently have no approved therapy,‚Äù said Annette Bakker, PhD, CEO, Children‚Äôs Tumor Foundation (CTF); Board Chair of CTF Europe. ‚ÄúCTF is dedicated to deploying its time, talent and funding towards accelerating the development of new treatments. We are thrilled that patients in the United States and Europe could soon have a new therapy available to them.‚Äù

- **Study Objective**: Emulate the ARISTOTLE trial to assess apixaban versus warfarin using UK clinical data.
- **Key Findings**: 
  - Noninferiority of apixaban for stroke/systemic embolism vs warfarin confirmed (HR 0.98 [0.82, 1.19]), but no superiority observed.
  - Similar event rates for stroke/SE (1.27%/year) between apixaban and ARISTOTLE findings; warfarin had lower event rates in the CPRD cohort.
  - Apixaban's effectiveness varies by warfarin time in therapeutic range (TTR): similar efficacy for poorly controlled warfarin (TTR < 0.75), but higher all-cause mortality compared to well-controlled warfarin (TTR ‚â• 0.75).
  - Notably better safety profile: reduced risk of major bleeding with apixaban compared to warfarin.
- **Implications**: These findings support existing NICE guidelines, emphasizing continued use of warfarin in controlled patients. Furthermore, the study validates trial emulation methods, offering potential for future real-world investigations in diverse populations.

Abstract
--------

### Background

Stroke prevention guidance for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) uses evidence generated from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, applicability to patient groups excluded from trials remains unknown. Real-world patient data provide an opportunity to evaluate outcomes in a trial analogous population of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) users and in patients otherwise excluded from RCTs; however, there remains uncertainty on the validity of methods and suitability of the data.

Successful reference trial emulation can support the generation of evidence around treatment effects in groups excluded or underrepresented in trials.

We used linked United Kingdom primary care data to investigate whether we could emulate the pivotal ARISTOTLE trial (apixaban versus warfarin) and extend the analysis to investigate the impact of warfarin time in therapeutic range (TTR) on results.

### Methods and findings

Patients with AF in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD Aurum) prescribed apixaban or warfarin from 1 January 2013 to 31 July 2019 were selected. ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria were applied to this population and matched to the RCT apixaban arm on baseline characteristics creating a trial-analogous apixaban cohort; this was propensity-score matched to warfarin users in the CPRD Aurum. ARISTOTLE outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression stratified by prior warfarin exposure status during 2.5 years of patient follow-up and results benchmarked against the trial results before treatment effectiveness was further evaluated based on (warfarin) TTR.

The dataset comprised 8,734 apixaban users and propensity-score matched 8,734 warfarin users. Results \[hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)\] confirmed apixaban noninferiority for stroke or systemic embolism (SE) \[CPRD 0.98 (0.82,1.19) versus trial 0.79 (0.66,0.95)\] and death from any cause \[CPRD 1.03 (0.93,1.14) versus trial 0.89 (0.80,0.998)\] but did not indicate apixaban superiority. Absolute event rates for stroke/SE were similar for apixaban in CPRD Aurum and ARISTOTLE (1.27%/year), whereas a lower event rate was observed for warfarin (CPRD Aurum 1.29%/year, ARISTOTLE 1.60%/year).

Analysis by TTR suggested similar effectiveness of apixaban compared with poorly controlled warfarin (TTR < 0.75) for stroke/SE \[0.91 (0.73, 1.14)\], all-cause death \[0.94 (0.84, 1.06)\], and superiority for major bleeding \[0.74 (0.63, 0.86)\]. However, when compared with well-controlled warfarin (TTR ‚â• 0.75), apixaban was associated with an increased hazard for all-cause death \[1.20 (1.04, 1.37)\], and there was no significant benefit for major bleeding \[1.08 (0.90, 1.30)\]. The main limitation of the study‚Äôs methodology are the risk of residual confounding, channelling bias and attrition bias in the warfarin arm, and selection bias and misclassification in the analysis by TTR.

### Conclusions

Analysis of noninterventional data generated results demonstrating noninferiority of apixaban versus warfarin consistent with prespecified benchmarking criteria. Unlike in ARISTOTLE, superiority of apixaban versus warfarin was not seen, possible due to the lower proportion of Asian patients and higher proportion of patients with well-controlled warfarin compared to ARISTOTLE. This methodological template can be used to investigate treatment effects of oral anticoagulants in patient groups excluded from or underrepresented in trials and provides a framework that can be adapted to investigate treatment effects for other conditions.

Author summary
--------------

### Why was this study done?

*   Stroke prevention treatment guidelines for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are based on results from randomised controlled trials (RCTs); we do not know if these results are relevant to patients that would not have been eligible to be included in the RCTs.
*   This study used routinely collected health data from the United Kingdom to emulate an RCT that compared apixaban to warfarin, ARISTOTLE, and also looked at whether the benefit of apixaban compared with warfarin was impacted by the quality of warfarin therapy (measured by time in therapeutic range (TTR)).
*   Emulating an RCT for stroke prevention in patients with AF should help to understand how transferable RCT results are to ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù practices and whether this methodological approach can help to improve treatment options and outcomes for patient groups currently underrepresented in clinical trials.

### What did the researchers do and find?

*   The researchers looked at patients with AF in a UK primary care data prescribed apixaban or warfarin and applied a ‚Äúreference trial emulation‚Äù approach, in which the ARISTOTLE trial eligibility, selection, and analysis approaches were applied to UK primary care data and results benchmarked against those of ARISTOTLE.
*   Patients prescribed apixaban had similar rates of outcomes to those prescribed warfarin in our cohort, and our results were successfully benchmarked against ARISTOTLE. Unlike ARISTOTLE, we did not see superiority of apixaban versus warfarin \[hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)\] for time to stroke or systemic embolism: 0.98 (0.82,1.19) in our cohort versus 0.79 (0.66,0.95) in ARISTOTLE.
*   We also found the benefit of apixaban versus warfarin differed for some outcomes depending on the quality of warfarin therapy with apixaban (i) superior only to poorly controlled warfarin therapy for major bleeding \[TTR < 0.75: 0.74 (0.63, 0.86), TTR ‚â• 0.75: 1.08 (0.90, 1.30)\] (ii) associated with an increased risk of death compared only to well-controlled warfarin therapy \[TTR ‚â• 0.75: 1.20 (1.04, 1.37), TTR < 0.75: 0.94 (0.84, 1.06)\].

### What do these findings mean?

*   Our results support the NICE guidelines on selecting treatment for stroke prevention in patients with AF and also provide reassurance on continuing warfarin in patients with high TTR.
*   We can use UK primary health care data to emulate a reference trial of treatments for the prevention of stroke in AF.
*   We can use the data and methods to look at how well treatments work in patients that would not have been included in RCTs such as those with multimorbidity or patient groups underrepresented in RCTs such as ethnic minority groups and older patients.
*   Study limitations include the possibility of residual confounding, a risk patients doing well on warfarin were overrepresented in our cohort, a lower proportion of Asian participants in our cohort compared with ARISTOTLE, and the likelihood of residual selection bias/misclassification in the TTR analysis.

Introduction
------------

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common type of cardiac arrhythmia with an estimated prevalence of 3.3% in UK adults aged ‚â•35 years \[[1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref001)\]. AF is a risk factor for stroke; patients with AF have a 5-fold increased risk of stroke compared with people without AF \[[2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref002)\], and around a quarter of all strokes are attributed to this arrhythmia \[[3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref003)\]. In addition, increased levels of mortality, morbidity, and disability with longer hospital stays are observed in stroke patients with AF compared with stroke patients without AF \[[4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref004),[5](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref005)\].

Pharmacological therapy recommended to reduce the risk of stroke in AF includes the use of oral anticoagulants (OACs). The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for AF since 2012 in the United Kingdom provided a choice of treatment alongside the older OAC class of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, which has been available for over 60 years. The VKA OACs require regular monitoring of international normalised ratio (INR) to keep patients in the optimal therapeutic range (typically 2.0 to 3.0) in which risk of both ischemic and bleeding events are minimised \[[6](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref006)\]. A patient may require dose adjustments to stay within their INR target range. A key measure of quality of warfarin treatment is, therefore, the time in therapeutic range (TTR), which estimates the proportion of time a patient has spent with INR within optimal range. A TTR of 0.75 or greater is often considered as indicating optimal INR control and suggests a patient is spending a high proportion of their time in their INR target range.

ARISTOTLE was a pivotal randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the DOAC apixaban designed to demonstrate noninferiority compared with warfarin in the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) in patients with AF. The results demonstrated superiority of apixaban over warfarin for both prevention of stroke/SE and safety (major bleeding) \[[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref007)\]. Results in the European Union patient subset from the trial suggested the observed superiority of apixaban might be dependent on how well warfarin therapy was managed in the comparator group \[[8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref008)\], an analysis that has not yet been performed outside of trial settings. In the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) review of ARISTOTLE, several professional groups noted the TTR of warfarin users in ARISTOTLE may be lower than what is typical in UK clinical practice \[[9](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref009)\].

Treatment guidelines for DOACs are based on evidence from RCTs; however, it is unclear whether these results extend to patient groups typically excluded from trials such as those with increased bleeding risk or severe comorbidities. While there have been a number of previous studies of DOAC effectiveness using noninterventional data, there remains uncertainty on whether the data sources and methods used have fully accounted for the lack of treatment randomisation and issues such as selection bias and confounding. Comparing results from real-world studies with RCT results is challenging due to differences in patient populations, treatment adherence, and study design. However, reference trial emulation involves use of an existing named RCT to (1) inform observational study design and (2) benchmark results against, providing confidence in validity of the selected observational methods and data \[[10](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref010)‚Äì[13](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref013)\]. The noninterventional analysis methods can then be applied, under a set of assumptions, to reliably estimate effects in groups of patients with AF who would have been excluded from (or underrepresented in) the reference trial \[[14](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref014)\] such as patients aged >80 that were underrepresented in ARISTOTLE compared with patients with AF in UK clinical practice and patients with increased bleeding risk that were excluded by the trial eligibility criteria.

There is increasing interest in trial emulation using observation data and in the application of recent developments in pharmacoepidemiology methods involving the inclusion of prevalent users. This study used a framework that involved coarsened exact matching to select patients matching the trial population on aggregate, and sampling of prevalent users in a way that avoids selection bias and emulates the process of screening into an RCT, to construct a cohort of patients similar to the target trial population that included both new and prevalent users. This methodological approach could be adapted to a variety of treatments and different therapeutic areas.

This study sought to (1) create an ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort using routinely collected primary and secondary care data in the UK, (2) benchmark results obtained in the ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort with ARISTOTLE results, and (3) explore whether apixaban treatment-effects in clinical practice are influenced by how well warfarin therapy is controlled.

Materials and methods
---------------------

This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline ([S1 STROBE](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s001) Checklist).

### Study design

A propensity score (PS) matched cohort study with emulation of a reference trial (ARISTOTLE).

### Setting/data sources

#### UK electronic healthcare records.

This study used noninterventional data from UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum, a database containing anonymised data from 738 primary care practices across England (approximately 13% of the population of England with 19 million patient records and 7 million active as of September 2018 \[[15](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref015)\]). CPRD Aurum contains information on clinical diagnoses, prescribing, referrals, tests, and demographic/lifestyle factors and is representative of the population of England in geographical spread, social deprivation, age, and sex \[[15](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref015)\]. This study also used 2 additional data sources linked to CPRD Aurum: Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data, which contain data on patients admitted to NHS hopsitals including diagnoses, admission, and discharge, and Office of National Statistics (ONS) mortality data.

#### The reference trial (ARISTOTLE).

ARISTOTLE was a randomised, double-blind trial completed in 2011, comparing apixaban with warfarin in the prevention of stroke and SE. The trial included 18,201 patients with AF and at least 1 additional risk factor for stroke. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority of apixaban compared with warfarin (noninferiorirty margin of 1.38 for the upper limit of the 95% CI of the hazard ratio (HR) for the primary outcome) and showed apixaban superiority for (1) the primary outcome of stroke or SE (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66, 0.95), (2) the safety endpoint of major bleeding (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.60, 0.80), and (3) death from any cause (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80, 0.99). The ARISTOTLE findings led to the NICE guidelines on stroke prophylaxis in patients with AF recommending apixaban as a treatment.

ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria and summary baseline patient characteristics were used to select a cohort of patients from CPRD Aurum analogous to the ARISTOTLE participants.

The use of CPRD and ARISTOTLE are described in a previous publication \[[14](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref014)\], and the use of CPRD for this project was approved by the MHRA Independent Scientific Advisory Committee ([S1 ISAC](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s002) Protocol). All data used in this study were anonymised.

### Patient selection

#### Step 1: Application of trial eligibility criteria to patients in CPRD.

We first selected HES-linked patients registered in CPRD Aurum between 1 January 2013 and 31 July 2019, who had at least 6 months between registration and the index date. ARISTOTLE recruited both new (warfarin-na√Øve) and prevalent (warfarin-experienced) users of warfarin with randomisation stratified on prior warfarin (or other VKA) exposure status (warfarin na√Øve or experienced). To be classified as warfarin-na√Øve patients were required to have no evidence of exposure to warfarin or other VKA in the 5 years prior to the index date. To enable selection of a similar cohort of patients in CPRD Aurum (including both new and prevalent users of warfarin), the following process was used in determining index date:

\- apixaban users

index date = first prescription of apixaban in the study period;

apixaban user classified as warfarin-na√Øve or warfarin-experienced at this date

\- warfarin users

for new users of warfarin: index date = first prescription of warfarin in the study period;

for prevalent users of warfarin: a pool of potential index dates was selected containing all prescription dates in the study period, with index date selected at the later treatment-history sampling stage (see step 3).

ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria (Table A2 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)) \[[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref007)\] were applied giving a trial-eligible cohort for apixaban users, a trial-eligible cohort of new users of warfarin, and a pool of potential index dates (with all potential index dates kept in regardless of ARISTOTLE eligibility at this stage) for warfarin continuers (prevalent warfarin users).

#### Step 2: Selection of apixaban trial-analogous patients in CPRD.

We selected a subset of the CPRD Aurum trial-eligible apixaban patients that better matched the ARISTOTLE apixaban participants based on aggregate summaries for the following key ARISTOTLE baseline characteristics:

*   Age
*   Sex
*   Congestive heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction
*   Hypertension requiring treatment
*   Diabetes mellitus
*   Prior stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/SE
*   Level of renal impairment
*   Prior VKA/warfarin exposure

To characterise the baseline patient characteristics of ARISTOTLE, we used the key publication of the trial results \[[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref007)\], discussion of trial results by regulatory bodies \[[8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref008),[9](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref009),[16](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref016)\], and publications on the trial presenting cross-tabulations on key characteristics \[[17](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref017),[18](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref018)\].

An ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort of CPRD Aurum apixaban patients was then selected using a modified form of coarsened exact matching \[[19](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref019)\] (see [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) for details).

#### Step 3: Matching of apixaban trial-analogous patients to warfarin trial-eligible patients in CPRD.

To emulate ARISTOTLE, which stratified randomisation on prior VKA exposure status, patients in the CPRD cohort were matched separately within the VKA-na√Øve and VKA-experienced strata. A 3-step procedure, based on methods proposed by Suissa and colleagues \[[20](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref020)\] and Webster-Clark and colleagues \[[21](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref021)\], was used to select and match patients in the VKA-experienced strata while avoiding selection bias; this procedure is summarised in [Fig 1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g001) and described in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003).

Fig 1. Matching of apixaban trial-analogous patients to warfarin trial-eligible patients \*This method has been found in a simulation study \[[21](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref021)\] to give unbiased results.

The trial-analogous CPRD Aurum apixaban patients were matched to warfarin CPRD Aurum patients using greedy nearest-neighbour matching on the logit of the PS; a caliper of 0.2 times the standard deviation of the logit of the PS was used for matching as recommended by Austin \[[22](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref022)\].

The covariates included in the PS models are detailed in [Table 1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t001).

The model resulting in the most balanced cohort was chosen with balance assessed by looking at standardised differences across all variables after matching using a target threshold of 0.05 for the maximum difference allowed for any individual variable. Balance of covariates considered to be most important in predicting outcome were prioritised, namely, age, sex, and stroke risk factors.

### Exposures and outcomes

#### Exposures.

Exposure to apixaban (5 mg/2.5 mg) or warfarin was determined using CPRD prescribing records with no restrictions on the dose prescribed.

#### Outcomes.

The primary effectiveness outcome was the composite of stroke (ischemic or haemorrhagic) or SE; individual components of this outcome (stroke, ischemic or uncertain type of stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, SE) and death from any cause were the key secondary effectiveness outcomes. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, and composite endpoints of effectiveness outcomes. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding (including by location‚Äîintracranial, gastrointestinal, or other location such as urinary or gynaecological). All outcomes involved hospitalisation or death and were ascertained using HES and ONS data. The ICD-10 codes used in ascertaining stroke occurrence have been recommended as having high positive predictive value \[[23](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref023)\].

### Statistical analysis

#### Methods of analysis.

A prospective protocol was published prior to the analysis detailing the planned analyses (\[[14](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref014)\]; also in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)).

Changes from the planned protocol are described in [Table 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t002).

All time-to-event endpoints were analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by prior VKA status (experienced, na√Øve). The effectiveness outcomes were analysed using the intention-to-treat principle, and major bleeding was analysed using an on-treatment censoring scheme. Patients were censored at 2.5 years after index date reflecting typical maximum duration of follow-up in ARISTOTLE. Cluster-robust standard errors were used with pair membership as the clustering variable \[[24](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref024),[25](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref025)\]. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed by looking at the log-log of the Kaplan‚ÄìMeier survival curves and inspection of scaled Schoenfeld residuals plotted against time. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 and R version 4.2.1.

#### Supplementary analyses.

A protocol planned analysis in the subset of patients deemed adherent (with adherence measured by TTR in the warfarin users and by proportion of days covered by prescriptions in the apixaban users) was planned to assess the impact of adherence on outcomes. The planned analysis was not possible due to the apixaban prescription data not providing a useful measure of adherence. An analysis by INR TTR was performed instead to assess the impact of warfarin control on results with all outcomes analysed by TTR (TTR < 0.75 and TTR ‚â• 0.75). Individual predicted TTR based on baseline variables was used for patients missing TTR. In order to perform the TTR analysis while maintaining balance in the baseline covariates, inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to rebalance the baseline characteristics, applying stabilised weights to the ARISTOTLE-analogous apixaban users. A similar approach to the main analysis was used with PS models constructed separately for the new users and warfarin-experienced users.

An additional post hoc analysis was performed looking at the proportion of apixaban patients prescribed reduced-dose apixaban along with a comparison of the patients meeting the criteria for dose-reduction against the dose actually prescribed. In this analysis, apixaban dose in the ARISTOTLE-analogous CPRD cohort was assessed and compared against the ARISTOTLE protocol-specified criteria and NICE criteria for reduced apixaban dose. ARISTOTLE specified that participants meeting any 2 of the following criteria assessed at the time of randomisation should have their apixaban dose reduced to 2.5 mg BID: age ‚â•80 years, body weight ‚â§60 kg, or serum creatinine ‚â•1.5 mg/dL. These criteria are equivalent to the NICE guidelines for dose reduction with NICE having an additional criteria indicating reduced dose in those with creatinine clearance 15 to 29 mL/minute.

In addition, to assess the impact of the quality of dose-adjustment in the CPRD cohort on the observed effectiveness of apixaban relative to warfarin, a supplementary post hoc analysis was performed looking at the results in the subset of apixaban patients prescribed the correct dose compared with IPTW rebalanced warfarin comparators.

#### Sensitivity analyses.

Primary and secondary effectiveness outcomes were also analysed using the on-treatment censoring scheme to investigate whether treatment discontinuation compromises confidence in the effectiveness analyses.

Treatment persistence was defined by looking at longitudinal prescription data for OACs; OAC treatment windows were derived in which gaps > = 6 months between prescription dates were considered as distinct treatment windows. The end of each OAC treatment window was derived as the date of the last prescription of index OAC + the number of days supply given in the last prescription + a grace period of 30 days. In cases of overlapping OAC treatment windows, the date of the first prescription of the subsequent OAC treatment window was used to define the end of the prior OAC window. A prescription for a different OAC from the index OAC treatment was considered as a treatment switch. An ending of index OAC treatment with no subsequent prescription for any other OAC recorded was considered as treatment stop. Gaps of > = 6 months with no subsequent OAC prescriptions recorded were categorised as having stopped OAC treatment.

The set of patients who switched or discontinued treatment during follow-up were examined to ascertain whether selection bias due to attrition may have affected the on-treatment analyses (Table A9 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)).

Apixaban was first launched for AF in the UK in January 2013, with relatively few patients receiving a prescription in the first year it was available; we therefore performed a sensitivity analysis with the start of study period shifted forwards a year to investigate the impact of inclusion of early adopters who may differ from later adopters of a new drug.

#### Confounding and bias.

In the study period, apixaban was a newly available treatment leading to the possibility of channelling bias \[[26](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref026)\]. By applying trial eligibility criteria to both treatment cohorts and matching using baseline covariates, we aimed to minimise channelling bias. To handle confounding, treatment arms were matched using propensity score matching (PSM) \[[27](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref027)\].

#### Benchmarking results against ARISTOTLE.

The study hypothesis was that results in the CPRD ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort would be comparable to the ARISTOTLE results, as defined by the prespecified benchmarking criteria. A slightly weaker benefit of apixaban versus warfarin was expected based on the weaker benefit seen in the EU subgroup of ARISTOTLE, and an expectation that the quality of warfarin control in UK patients may be higher than that observed in ARISTOTLE.

The benchmarking criteria for considering the results in the trial-analogous CPRD cohort to be comparable with ARISTOTLE were prespecified and published previously \[[14](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref014)\]:

*   The effect size must be clinically comparable with the ARISTOTLE findings; the HR for time to stroke/SE with the HR must be between 0.69 and 0.99. This range is not symmetrical around the ARISTOTLE estimate of 0.79 as it is anticipated the treatment effect in routine clinical care may be weaker than that seen in the optimised setting of a clinical trial.
*   The upper limit of the 95% CI for the HR for time to stroke/SE must be less than 1.38 (noninferiority margin used in ARISTOTLE, updated since protocol‚Äîsee [Table 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t002)).

The benchmarking step applied only to the primary effectiveness outcome in the trial-analogous CPRD cohort; results in other groups such as patients underrepresented or excluded from the trial would not necessarily be expected to remain consistent to the RCT results, given the relative risks may differ in these groups. Comparability of other outcomes was to be assessed descriptively with no formal criteria or hypothesis testing used.

### Missing data

Patients with missing systolic blood pressure (0.1%), body mass index (3.3%), smoking status (0.1%), or socioeconomic status (0.1%) were excluded from the trial-eligible cohort as the proportion of patients with these missing was low. Patients with missing renal function (1.3%), ethnicity (0.4%), or alcohol use (5.6%) were kept in the cohort through a missing indicator approach; this approach is valid under the assumption that these variables act as confounders and influence clinician prescribing decisions only when observed \[[28](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref028)\]. A total of 1,176 (13.3%) warfarin users in the CPRD cohort did not have INR measurements in the data during their treatment period with predicted TTR used for these patients in the analysis by TTR (see [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) for details).

### Ethics

Scientific approval was provided by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine research ethics committee (ref 17682) and the independent scientific advisory committee of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (protocol no. 19\_066R). CPRD data are already approved via a national research ethics committee for purely noninterventional research of this type. CPRD data are analysed anonmymously; therefore, individual patient consent is not sought by contributing medical practices when data are shared with CPRD; however, patients are able to opt out of their patient information being shared for research.

Results

### Participants

Between 1 January 2013 and 31 July 2019, there were 86,888 people with AF prescribed apixaban and 159,632 prescribed warfarin in HES-linked CPRD Aurum practices ([Fig 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g002)). Application of minimum registration period and ARISTOTLE inclusion criteria reduced this to 67,539 apixaban and 139,527 warfarin patients. After applying ARISTOTLE exclusion criteria, there were 41,487 apixaban and 101,159 warfarin patients.

Selecting apixaban patients to match ARISTOTLE on key baseline characteristics yielded 9,120 apixaban patients (3,912 new users and 5,208 prevalent users) available for PSM to 101,159 warfarin patients. For 274 apixaban patients, no match could be found giving a PS matched cohort of 8,846 apixaban and 8,846 warfarin patients.

### Application of ARISTOTLE inclusion/exclusion criteria and matching to ARISTOTLE

Applying the ARISTOTLE inclusion/exclusion criteria and matching to ARISTOTLE baseline patient characteristics resulted in a cohort similar to the ARISTOTLE apixaban participants ([Table 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t003)); for example, median age was 78 and mean CHADS2 score 2.4 in CPRD Aurum before applying trial criteria and matching, whereas the median age of 71 and mean CHADS2 score 2.1 after these steps matched the ARISTOTLE apixaban participants. The ARISTOTLE-analogous apixaban arm matched the trial arm on prior VKA exposure, age, sex, stroke risk factors and CHADS2 score, and proportion of patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.

Differences remained on baseline characteristics it was not feasible to match on, namely, ethnicity (95.2% white, 2.4% Asian in CPRD Aurum apixaban versus 82.6% white, 14.4% Asian in ARISTOTLE) and concomitant medications (amiodarone 3.8%, aspirin 5.8%, digoxin 13.9% in CPRD Aurum apixaban users versus amiodarone 11.1%, aspirin 31.3%, digoxin 32.0% in ARISTOTLE apixaban arm). See [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) for details on matching feasibility.

### Propensity score matching of CPRD Aurum trial-analogous apixaban users to CPRD Aurum warfarin users

#### Results of propensity score matching.

Before PSM, differences between treatment groups were evident for most baseline variables including age (median age 71 in apixaban versus 78 in warfarin), sex (apixaban 35.6% female versus warfarin 43.6%), and stroke risk factors (see [Table 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t003)). After PSM, all baseline characteristics were well balanced (maximum standardised difference .031). From 9,120 apixaban users, only 274 (3.0%) were dropped due to unsuccessful matching.

### Main results

The HR for stroke/SE in the PS matched groups was 0.98 (95% CI 0.82,1.19) ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003) and Table A3 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)). This association was consistent with the noninferiority margin (upper limit of the 95% CI less than 1.38) \[[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref007)\] but did not show superiority as predicted by ARISTOTLE \[HR 0.79 (95% CI 0.66,0.95)\] ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003) and Table A2 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)). The outcome of all-cause mortality also showed noninferiority \[Aurum 1.03 (0.93,1.14) versus trial 0.89 (0.80,0.998)\] but did not indicate apixaban superiority. Absolute event rates for the primary outcome and components were close to the trial for apixaban‚Äîfor example \[comparing Aurum versus trial\], stroke/SE event rate of 1.27%/year versus 1.27%, whereas the warfarin group had a lower event rate compared with ARISTOTLE (stroke/SE event rate of 1.29%/year versus 1.60% and hemorrhagic stroke 0.33%/year versus 0.47%/year) ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003)). Mean duration of follow-up in the cohort was 1.8 years in the apixaban arm and 2.2 years in the warfarin arm.

### Analysis of impact of warfarin time in therapeutic range (TTR)

TTR was higher in the CPRD cohort than in ARISTOTLE (mean 0.73 versus 0.62, median 0.76 versus 0.66).

Analysis by TTR suggested noninferiority of apixaban versus warfarin in those with TTR < 0.75 \[stroke/SE 0.91 (0.73,1.14), all-cause death 0.94 (0.84, 1.06)\] ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003)). Apixaban was associated with similar hazards for stroke by category of TTR and increased hazards of death compared to warfarin in those with well-controlled warfarin treatment (TTR ‚â• 0.75) \[stroke/SE 1.05 (0.82, 1.34), all-cause death 1.20 (1.04, 1.37)\] ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003)).

### Analysis of apixaban dose-adjustment

The proportion of patients meeting the criteria for reduced dose apixaban ([Table 4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t004)) was similar between the CPRD ARISTOTLE-analogous apixaban, warfarin, and RCT apixaban groups (4.9%, 4.9%, and 4.7%, respectively). When including the additional NICE criteria of creatinine clearance, 5.1% of apixaban users in the ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort had an indication for reduced-dose apixaban, yet a larger proportion (14.3%) were prescribed reduced dose apixaban implying some patients in CPRD Aurum may have been prescribed the wrong dose and/or information on criteria for dose reduction may have been missing from CPRD Aurum.

A futher analysis of the quality of dose-adjustment in patients in CPRD Aurum ([Table 5](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t005)) indicated 10.5% of patients may have been prescribed an incorrect dose of apixaban at the index prescription based on the data contained in their electronic health records (EHRs). The majority of incorrect dose relating to patients being prescribed reduced-dose apixaban despite not meeting the criteria for dose reduction. A large proportion of patients prescribed an incorrect dose had only 1 dose adjustment criteria (59.6% of those with incorrect dose), suggesting some prescribers may have thought a dose reduction was warranted when only 1 criteria was present. Other possible reasons for the incorrect dose-adjustment observed here may be data on the criteria missing from the EHR (i.e., incorrect ascertainment) or consideration of other medical history that made a prescriber adjust the dose.

To assess the impact of the quality of dose-adjustment in the CPRD cohort on the effectiveness of apixaban, a supplementary post hoc analysis was performed looking at the results in the subset of apixaban patients prescribed the correct dose (_N_ = 7,921) compared with IPTW rebalanced warfarin comparators. The results in this subset were consistent with the primary results showing apixaban to be noninferior to warfarin (stroke/SE 0.96 \[0.78,1.17\], death 0.97 \[0.87,1.09\]) with the results moving slightly closer to those observed in ARISTOTLE.

### Safety results

The analysis for safety outcomes is presented in [Fig 4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g004) and Table A5 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003); patients on apixaban had a lower risk of major bleeding compared with those on warfarin, HR (95% CI) 0.88 (0.77,1.00), consistent with ARISTOTLE. Analysis by TTR suggested superiority of apixaban for major bleeding in those with TTR <0.75 \[0.74 (0.63, 0.86)\], whereas apixaban users had a similar risk of major bleeding compared with those with optimal warfarin control (TTR ‚â• 0.75) \[1.08 (0.90,1.30)\].

### Sensitivity analyses

Table A7 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) shows the proportion of patients switching treatment. A higher proportion of patients on warfarin switched to an alternative OAC during follow-up compared with those on apixaban (16.3% versus 6.1%).

Comparing patients who switched treatment during follow-up with those that continued on index treatment (Table A8 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)) suggests possible selection bias due to attrition in on-treatment analyses with median TTR markedly lower in warfarin users who switched treatments compared with persistent warfarin users (median TTR 0.64 versus 0.78). On-treatment analyses would likely be biased against apixaban since patients doing badly on warfarin (i.e., with low TTR) who would be more likely to experience events in the warfarin arm would be censored at treatment switch.

On-treatment analyses censoring around treatment switch or discontinuation are presented for the effectiveness analyses in the appendix (Table A6 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)); the results show evidence of the expected attrition bias against apixaban when compared with the ITT results in [Fig 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g002), for example, HR for stroke/SE is 1.04 (0.86, 1.25) in the on-treatment compared with 0.98 (95% CI 0.82, 1.19) in the ITT analysis.

Repeating the analysis with start of study period shifted forwards a year to investigate the impact of inclusion of early adopters yielded similar results to the primary analysis (Table A9 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)).

Prior INR control was not included in the PS models for the VKA-experienced due to a high rate of missing prior INR data (missing for 34% in the apixaban arm). A post hoc sensitivity analysis including a prior INR control variable in the PSM gave results consistent with the primary results \[stroke/SE HR 95% CI 1.02 (0.86,1.21)\]. Details of this post hoc analysis are in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003).

Discussion
----------

In our emulation of ARISTOTLE using UK routinely collected healthcare data, we found results that met our predefined criteria for comparability with the trial. We saw noninferiority of apixaban versus warfarin for prevention of stroke or SE, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding but did not see superiority of apixaban versus warfarin for these outcomes as was seen in ARISTOTLE. We found higher TTR in the patients using warfarin in our cohort compared with the warfarin arm of ARISTOTLE (median 0.76 versus 0.66). While our analysis by TTR showed noninferiority of apixaban versus warfarin for our stroke or SE outcome, we observed an increased risk of death on apixaban compared with patients well-controlled on warfarin (TTR ‚â• 0.75) but not when compared with those on poorly controlled warfarin (TTR < 0.75). For major bleeding, while apixaban was superior when compared to those on poorly controlled warfarin, there was no difference when compared to those on well-controlled warfarin. We saw evidence suggesting suboptimal dosing of apixaban in our cohort with approximately 10% of patients in the apixaban arm prescribed the reduced dose without meeting the criteria for the reduced dose.

We found the differences in the overall treatment-effect estimates between our cohort and ARISTOTLE may be explained by the lower proportion of Asian patients in our cohort, differences in INR control in the warfarin arm of our cohort compared with ARISTOTLE, and the higher proportion of patients prescribed a reduced dose of apixaban in our cohort compared with ARISTOTLE.

Our findings are consistent with a UK study of ischemic stroke, which compared DOACs with warfarin \[[29](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref029)\]. A Danish study found similar results to ours for stroke/SE \[[30](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref030)\], although they found apixaban users had a lower risk of death; a study of US claims data \[[31](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref031)\] also found apixaban was associated with a lower risk of death. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 studies \[[32](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref032)\] found pooled results for stroke and intracranial haemorrhage that were consistent with ours. One study (in US claims data) also aimed to replicate ARISTOTLE \[[33](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref033),[34](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref034)\] and, in contrast to our study, found superiority for apixaban for stroke/SE, which may be linked to population differences such as lower TTR in US patients on warfarin \[[35](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref035)\] and differences in ethnicity. None of these studies matched to the ARISTOTLE trial participants, included prevalent users, or looked at how warfarin control impacted results. Further details on these studies including design and key results are summarised in Table A10 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003).

A key strength of our study was the use of a framework that sampled prevalent users (the continuing users of warfarin in this study) in a way that avoided selection bias facilitating the construction of a cohort of patients similar to the target trial population, which included both new users of apixaban and warfarin (VKA-na√Øve) and patients with prior VKA exposure (VKA-experienced) that were randomised to stay on warfarin or switch to apixaban. The use of PSM, stratified by treatment history, enabled us to select a matched cohort well balanced on important covariates. The successful emulation of ARISTOTLE by our study shows that valid treatment effects can be obtained for important outcomes with OACs using noninterventional methods with routinely collected clinical data. Having validated this framework, in future studies, we can look at the effectiveness of OACs in AF patient groups not included or underrepresented in the RCT, such as elderly patients and those at increased bleeding risk. We also recommend future analyses with an extended follow-up period compared with this study to compare the long-term outcomes seen in the noninterventional cohort with projected long-term outcomes from the RCT.

An additional strength of our study was the ability to explore the quality of warfarin treatment in our cohort and the impact of INR control on the treatment effect estimates. Our finding that the benefits of apixaban versus warfarin for some outcomes depended on the quality of INR control in the warfarin arm answers questions raised in the NICE premeeting briefing, which looked at apixaban in the NVAF population and noted the TTR seen in ARISTOTLE ‚Äúmay be lower than what is typical in UK clinical practice‚Äù and ‚Äúapixaban compared with well-controlled warfarin (TTR 75% or more) may not be superior in the long term‚Äù \[[8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref008)\]. ARISTOTLE presented outcomes by centre (for example, hospital) TTR quartile and did not show a signal of treatment efficacy differing by centre TTR quartile. We were able to use IPTW to estimate the treatment effect in the different warfarin TTR groups and used predicted TTR for warfarin users missing TTR to attempt to limite the risk of selection bias.

While our study aimed to emulate ARISTOTLE using suitable methods, there were several limitations. Some of the criteria assessed for ARISTOTLE eligibility may not be well recorded in CPRD leading to a risk of misclassification. Furthermore, misclassification of ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria and baseline covariates could be differential by treatment in the VKA-experienced patients if criteria such as renal function are more likely to be checked before changing treatment. However, the most important risk factors for the primary outcome of stroke (the components of CHA2DS2\-VASc stroke risk score) are mostly well recorded in CPRD Aurum and HES.

Our cohort did not attempt to match the trial on the use of concomitant medications in order for our cohort to reflect typical UK prescribing. In ARISTOTLE, 31% of participants were using aspirin and 11% using amiodarone at baseline, whereas in our cohort, only 6% were recorded as using aspirin and 4% amiodarone. Amiodarone potentiates the effects of warfarin, and concomitant use of amiodarone with DOACs is associated with increased risk of major bleeding \[[36](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref036)\], while concomitant use of aspirin increases the risk of bleeding for both warfarin \[[37](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref037)\] and DOACs \[[38](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref038)\]. The difference in concomitant medication usage between our cohort and the trial population may explain some of the observed differences in treatment effects.

A key limitation of our study was the inability to match ARISOTLE on ethnicity, meaning the CPRD Aurum cohort included a low number of patients from Asian and Hispanic groups when compared with the RCT (14.5% of participants in ARISTOTLE were Asian compared to 2.4% in our ARISTOTLE-analogous CPRD cohort). There are known racial differences in the treatment effects of OACs with Asian patients experiencing a higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage compared with white patients; in ARISTOTLE, Asian participants experienced double the risk of stroke or SE when on warfarin therapy when compared with white participants \[[39](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref039)\]. The reasons for the increased risk of bleeding associated with warfarin therapy in Asian patients is hypothesised to be associated with differences in drug metabolism and prevelance of cerebral microbleeds \[[40](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref040)\]. The difference in proportion of Asian patients between our cohort and ARISTOTLE is therefore likely to explain some of the differences in treatment effects seen and limits the generalisability of our study, with the results of our study of most relevanance to white patients. This limitation on ethnicity arose from the data source used and time period studied (patients with AF in CPRD Aurum 2013‚Äì2019), which had a low proportion of Asian patients, likely due to AF being associated with older age combined with a lower prevalence of AF in Asian patients compared with white patients \[[41](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref041)\]. While CPRD Aurum is largely representative of the UK population in relation to ethnicity \[[42](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref042)\], diversity is still limited for older individuals. Despite this, CPRD Aurum has shown to be a useful resource for investigating treatment effects in different ethnic groups for indications such as hypertension, which is more prevalent and occurs at a younger age in ethnic minority groups, with similar trial replication methods used to compare antihypertensive treatment effects in underrepresented ethnic groups \[[13](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref013)\].

The approach our study used for handling missing data on baseline covariates relied on assumptions on the relationship between missingness, treatment, and outcomes, which may not be valid; however, the low proportion of missing data means that this is unlikely to have impacted the results. In the coarsened exact matching step, the choice of variables will have an impact on the resulting cohort selected, meaning a different combination of variables could lead to different results. There is a risk that residual confounding may be present despite the use of PSM. The use of PSM also has the potential to introduce bias by dropping patients from the cohort \[[19](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref019)\]; however, PSM is well suited to the process of trial emulation including prevalent users, and a low number of apixaban users were dropped due to unsuccessful matching. The inclusion of prevalent users of warfarin in the cohort risks the introduction of selection bias \[[20](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref020),[21](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref021)\]; this was avoided by use of a method shown to produce unbiased estimates in a simulation study \[[21](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref021)\]. We found consistent results between our new and prevalent user strata across multiple outcomes providing reassurance the method used was likely to have successfully avoided selection bias.

Apixaban along with other DOACs were rapidly adopted as preferred first-line OAC in AF during the study period; it was therefore not possible to match on calendar date leading to a difference in follow-up time between the treatment arms in our cohort. A higher proportion of warfarin users switched to alternative OAC during follow-up compared with those prescribed apixaban (16% versus 6%). The impact of this differential switching during follow-up was addressed in the sensitivity analyses. The availability of new alternative treatments during the study period also means there is a risk of channelling bias in that over time the patients still on warfarin are more likely to be those doing well on warfarin. INR control prior to the index date was not included in the PS for the prevalent users due to a high rate of missing data; however, other variables associated with poor INR control were included in the models, and an exploratory post hoc analysis including a variable for poor INR control gave results consistent with the primary results.

Adherence to treatment was difficult to assess in our study due to automatic repeat prescriptions; treatment persistence was more useful in providing a measure of pattern of medicine use over time. In the analysis by TTR, the adherence of patients using apixaban was not accounted for; however, a previous UK study showed apixaban had higher adherence than VKAs \[[43](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref043)\], meaning we would expect to see better effectiveness outcomes in apixaban. Futhermore, the use of IPTW in the analysis by TTR means predictors of poor adherence are likely to have been balanced between treatments. The analysis of TTR is limited by this being a post-baseline measure available for only 1 treatment arm leading to a risk of selection bias in this analysis‚Äîpatients with TTR available in the study may be more healthy than those without this measure given that patients have to survive and not be hospitalised to have INR measurements available in CPRD Aurum. The limitation of use of a post-baseline measurement available for 1 treatment arm was also evident in the RCTs of DOACs versus warfarin and is mitigated in our study through the use of IPTW and predicted TTR for patients that were missing TTR (using a model to predict TTR that used INR measurements restricted to the first year of follow-up). Given the risk of selection bias in the analysis by TTR and risk of misclassification of TTR for those missing TTR, these results should be considered exploratory and interpreted with caution. Sensitivity analyses in our cohort using an on-treatment censoring scheme showed evidence of attrition bias. The regular measurement of INR and availability of alternative anticoagulants makes warfarin therapy particularly prone to attrition bias since a patient may be more likely to switch to a DOAC if their INR is frequently out of the optimal range or if they have not been adhering to scheduled INR testing.

To conclude, we found that applying a reference trial emulation approach allowed us to emulate a landmark randomised trial of apixaban versus warfarin using UK noninterventional data, with results meeting prespecified benchmarking criteria based on the reference trial results. This trial emulation method provides valid treatment effect estimates for apixaban compared to warfarin and can be used to determine risks and benefits of AF medications in people treated in routine clinical care. This study demonstrates a successful real-world application of novel methods that have been proposed for the inclusion of prevalent users in observational studies, with the application of an adaptation to mimic the screening process making the method suitable for emulation of RCTs that include prevalent users. These methods could be adapted for emulation of RCTs in other therapeutic areas and for looking at patient groups underrepresented or excluded from RCTs.

The weaker overall treatment benefit observed in our cohort appears to be due to a higher proportion of patients with well-controlled warfarin in the UK clinical context, compared with the trial. Our exploratory analysis by TTR showed similar results for stroke and a greater benefit for apixaban for major bleeding compared with TTR <0.75; conversely, a slightly higher risk of death was observed on apixaban compared with well-controlled warfarin.

2024-08-29 08:38:00,2024-09-03 01:34:20,"ü¶† Exciting developments in antibiotic design! Recent research on plectasin, a unique antibiotic, shows how it binds selectively to bacterial cell membranes, providing new insights for future therapies. Here are some key takeaways:

- **Plectasin's Mechanism**: Unlike traditional antibiotics, plectasin targets lipid II, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls, forming dense supramolecular structures for specific binding.
- **Impact on Resistance**: Targeting lipid II is promising since bacteria have no known way to modify it, reducing the risk of developing resistance.
- **Clinical Application**: Though effective against gram-positive bacteria, its clinical development has faced hurdles. Yet, it remains a compelling candidate for future antibiotic therapies.
- **Research Implications**: The findings suggest that both the binding efficiency and the oligomerization of antibiotics must be optimized for effective treatment.

[Markus Weingarth](https://www.weingarth-group.net/), a biochemist at Utrecht University, considers lipid II, a building block of bacteria cell walls, one of the most promising antibiotic targets. Human cells don‚Äôt produce it ‚Äî so targeting it avoids toxicity ‚Äî and bacteria struggle to develop resistance against it.

His research group recently published a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01696-9) in _Nature Microbiology_, in which they reported that the antibiotic plectasin binds lipid II by forming dense structures on bacterial membranes (1). The findings improve researchers‚Äô understanding of how lipid II binding disrupts the cell walls of bacteria, which can help them develop better antibiotics.

Novozyme‚Äôs scientists first [described](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1185723?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) plectasin‚Äôs mechanism of action in 2010 (2). However, in their experiments, they used artificial membranes called micelles and showed that each plectasin molecule paired with one lipid II molecule. However, micelles do not accurately mimic the membrane environment. ‚ÄúWe took a gamble, believing that what happened in micelles was not the real deal, and this turned out to be the case,‚Äù said Weingarth. In biological membranes, the team found that plectasin formed massive supramolecular structures upon lipid II binding. ‚ÄúWe saw that the supramolecular mechanism was not the exception, but rather the rule among the lipid II binders.‚Äù

**How is plectasin‚Äôs mechanism of action different from that of other antibiotics?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conventional antimicrobial peptides selectively bind bacteria based on electrostatics, as bacterial membranes are negatively charged while human cell membranes are positively charged. This electrostatic interaction is fairly unspecific. However, plectasin targets lipid II specifically based on both structure and charge, making it a highly selective target binder. This specificity marks its first major difference. Most drugs follow a conventional ""one drug, one target"" mechanism, where the drug and the target interact directly. In contrast, plectasin and other lipid II binders form massive supramolecular structures upon target binding. This formation is not just a feature but a critical aspect of the mechanism. Without these superstructures, there would be no stable target binding. These two prominent features of plectasin ‚Äî highly specific interaction with the target and supramolecular recognition ‚Äî distinguish it from conventional antimicrobial peptides.

The other thing that stands out about plectasin‚Äôs mechanism is that it is calcium modulated, which was an unexpected discovery. In hindsight, it seems obvious given the presence of a large ionic pocket that naturally binds calcium. However, this aspect had not been mentioned in any previous publications on plectasin.

**What makes lipid II a good antibiotic target?**
-------------------------------------------------

Lipid II has fatty acid tails and a pyrophosphate head group, which bacteria cannot alter. There are no known cases of bacteria replacing the pyrophosphate group for peptidoglycan synthesis, making it an absolute bottleneck for their cell wall biosynthesis. However, bacteria might be able to develop indirect resistance mechanisms, such as making the target inaccessible. They could make the peptidoglycan layer so dense that the drug never reaches the target. This is energy-intensive and unstable. Additionally, bacteria cannot make more lipid II once it‚Äôs captured, so targeting lipid II at these immutable sites makes it difficult for bacteria to develop stable resistance mechanisms.

> We saw that the supramolecular mechanism was not the exception, but rather the rule among the lipid II binders.¬†  
> ‚Äì Markus Weingarth, Utrecht University

**How effective is plectasin as an antibiotic?**
------------------------------------------------

Plectasin is not effective against gram-negative bacteria because it cannot overcome their outer membrane. However, plectasin is highly efficient against gram-positive bacteria and maintains this effectiveness in animal models of infection. Despite its potential as a relevant therapeutic, I am pessimistic about its future because the clinical development of plectasin was discontinued, and the work was never published. However, plectasin ticks many important boxes: It is stable in serum, non-cytotoxic, and highly efficient against a broad range of superbugs, including in animal models of infection, making it a compelling clinical candidate.

Although plectasin‚Äôs future as a therapeutic is uncertain, the study‚Äôs findings have significant implications for the design of lipid II-binding antibiotics. It‚Äôs crucial to optimize both the part of the drug that binds the target and the part responsible for oligomerization. This aspect has been ignored so far, as the focus has traditionally been on target binding alone. However, target binding and oligomerization are strongly interdependent. Only when both are optimized can ideal target binding occur.

[Myrtle Davis](https://www.bms.com/researchers-and-partners/our-r-and-d-team/researchers-bios/featured-researcher-myrtle-davis.html), scientific vice president of discovery toxicology at Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), has had an impressive 30-year toxicology career. After a postdoctoral position in toxicologic pathology, she became a faculty member at the University of Maryland. Before joining BMS, she was a research toxicologist at Eli Lilly and later became the chief of the toxicology pharmacology branch of the developmental therapeutics program at the National Cancer Institute. Having worked in the academia, government, and industry sectors, Davis has been instrumental in leveraging her expertise to advance several drug candidates to Phase 1 clinical trials and beyond. Her commitment to enhancing patients‚Äô experience through optimized drug development workflows remains at the forefront of her work. ‚ÄúWe have limitations in what we can predict from non-clinical experiments,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe challenge is making sure our clinical data feeds back into the non-clinical space so we continue to improve patient outcomes.‚Äù

The discovery process starts with the target. Those who study diseases look at how the target contributes to disease. We look at the opposite side and ask what the target does in a healthy tissue or cell and what happens if that role gets compromised. We then test whether modulating the target in normal tissues results in toxicity. Our work continues into the Phase 3 stage of clinical development, where we examine toxicities that may occur after several months of treatment or _in vitro_ exposure, building evidence alongside clinical data for adverse effects. For example, diacylglycerol kinase was one of our recent targets. We determined the role of this protein in normal cells and conducted experiments to see whether modulating it made those cells dysfunctional. Once we selected a molecule that appeared promising, we progressed to early drug development studies to support a Phase 1 trial, which helped us determine the dosing schedule. We also identified biomarkers to monitor adverse effects, which we implemented successfully.

**What types of _in vitro_ assays do you use in toxicity evaluations?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once we know where the target is expressed, our next step is to identify the specific cell that expresses it. We then use an _in vitro_ assay system to evaluate the effect of modulating the target in a physiologically relevant context. These cell culture experiments, whether 3D, 2D, or using tissue slices, are designed to mimic what we expect _in vivo_. We use a variety of assays, each tailored to answer specific questions and ensure physiological relevance, ranging from simple cell viability to complex pathway analyses.

**How do you decide when to move from _in vitro_ to _in vivo_¬†¬†experiments?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moving to _in vivo_ studies depends on whether there are questions we cannot address¬†_in vitro_, and there will be several. We make this decision based on the physiology and the normal role of the target in tissues and cells. Another factor in this decision is regulatory expectations. When there is a relevant model for evaluating human safety, we have to use it to understand potential liabilities, toxicities, risks, and other concerns.

**How do you assess the potential long-term effects of a new drug?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Predicting long-term outcomes based on early _in vitro_ or other short-term systems is very challenging. However, we can use vigilant systems like the vaccine adverse effects reporting system and our diligence missions that monitor patient outcomes in the clinic. Clinical data provide the best insights into what might happen in the long term. Our focus is on using clinical outcomes from Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials to predict what might occur after two or three years of treatment. We then bring this information back into early discovery to refine our models and improve our predictive capabilities.

**How do you use predictive toxicology in toxicology evaluations?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The word ‚Äúprediction‚Äù is a word we would love to use with confidence. For a predictive model, we're working on integrating all available data, including clinical data. We gather and consolidate this information with advanced technologies that allow us to analyze and identify potential patterns that could help us foresee future outcomes. A critical aspect of this process is model validation. To make reliable predictions, we need enough data to validate our models, both in clinical settings and earlier phases. This involves comparing predicted outcomes with actual results to ensure the models' accuracy. That's exciting because we have so much data, and the new technologies allow us to see patterns that help us make predictions.

**How are you using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for determining toxicity?**¬†
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We build machine learning models that can learn from our data. Then we train our toxicologists to make decisions from the complex data sources that these machines deconvolute. For example, we're using AI to reduce the number of studies we need. Our chemistry group is focused on rapid¬†_in silico_ evaluations of molecular features from molecules. Without synthesizing anything, we can define features that influence the pharmacokinetics and toxicities that we might see _in vivo._¬†In pathology, AI helps by quickly categorizing images from slides as normal or abnormal. This speeds up diagnoses for pathologists. We digitized our histology and discovery toxicology data early on, allowing us to apply deep neural network algorithms to assist pathologists and define the limitations of these networks. Our early digitization means we have extensive data for the algorithms to learn from, which helps us progress more quickly.

**What other emerging trends in toxicology do you think will affect drug development?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're currently working with spatial transcriptomics and finding it incredibly powerful. It allows us to see the gene signature within each cell in context, which gives us an atlas of information. For instance, when we need to know where a target is expressed, we no longer need to conduct an experiment; we can simply refer to this data source. Spatial transcriptomics helps us understand where the target is and how pathways might affect other cells. This capability opens questions that we can explore _in silico_. Additionally, I've seen impressive applications of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods combined with other AI techniques. Traditional QSAR models, when integrated with these new methods, show incredible promise. We're keeping an eye on how we might use these advancements at BMS.

**What has been the most rewarding part of helping characterize the toxicity profiles of new drugs?**¬†
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patient experience is our beacon. We know that no prediction is absolute and that no technology alone will solve all problems and answer all questions. When we enter a Phase 1 or 2 trial, and the dose that we selected proves to be accurate, we avoid adverse effects in the first dose. This confirms that we've chosen a promising molecule to move forward. Looking back at past drugs, we see cases where the adverse effects were significant, often not much better than the disease itself in terms of patient experience. My satisfaction comes from hearing a patient say, ""Your drug has been manageable; I've been okay."" Knowing that our work contributes to a better patient experience is incredibly fulfilling.

Key takeaways:
--------------

*   The authorization is supported by positive data from a phase 3 pivotal trial.
*   Avanzanite Bioscience has exclusive rights to market Akantior in 26 countries in Europe.

The European Commission granted marketing authorization to Akantior for the treatment of _A__canthamoeba_ [keratitis](https://www.healio.com/news/ophthalmology/20240304/video-oxygen-does-not-play-a-role-in-crosslinking-for-infectious-keratitis), according to a press release from Avanzanite Bioscience.

The decision was backed by positive results from the phase 3 pivotal Orphan Drug for _Acanthamoeba_ Keratitis (ODAK) trial, which included 135 patients. Of these patients, 84.8% were cured of _A__canthamoeba_ keratitis (AK) after treatment with Akantior (polyhexanide, Avanzanite Bioscience). In addition, 66.7% of patients achieved full vision restoration without the need for optical [cornea transplants](https://www.healio.com/news/ophthalmology/20240718/blog-choose-the-transplantsaving-path).

     ![Image 5: Generic Breaking News infographic](https://www.healio.com/~/media/slack-news/generic-infographics/2023/generic-breaking-news.jpg?w=800)

The European Commission granted marketing authorization to Akantior for the treatment of _Acanthamoeba_ keratitis.  
  

According to the release, the drug is the first and only authorized medicinal treatment for AK globally. It previously received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a positive recommendation from the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products.

Akantior is the second rare disease medicine commercialized by Avanzanite, which has secured exclusive rights to commercialize the treatment in 26 countries in Europe.

‚ÄúThis marketing authorization is the beginning of a new chapter for the treatment of _A__canthamoeba_ keratitis and a monumental victory for AK patients in Europe,‚Äù **Adam Plich,** founder and CEO of Avanzanite Bioscience, said in the release. ‚ÄúAt Avanzanite, we are committed to supporting broad access to our innovative therapies and look forward to collaborating with local health authorities in 26 European countries to secure sustainable access agreements so we can save the eyes of as many eligible patients as possible.‚Äù
