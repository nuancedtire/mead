New Data Bolsters First-Line Combo Approach in Kidney Cancer,2024-09-20 06:44:00,https://www.targetedonc.com/view/first-line-treatment-for-kidney-cancer-new-data-strengthens-combo-approach,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638624114412447624-66ed192a191936c4d1e7cb10.jpg,"A post hoc analysis from the CheckMate-9ER study reveals that increased fucosylation and sialylation of serum proteins are negative prognostic indicators for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nivolumab plus cabozantinib or sunitinib. High levels of specific glycopeptides may predict better responses to the combination therapy over sunitinib. This exploratory research suggests the need for further investigation into glycopeptide biomarkers for RCC treatment outcomes, highlighting the potential role of protein glycosylation in cancer prognosis and therapy response. The study was presented at the 2024 ESMO Congress.",Targeted Oncology
Neurodegenerative Disorders Detected by Leptin Deficiency,2024-09-20 06:38:00,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-09-higher-leptin-brain-late-life.html,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638624110791211292-66ed176c191936c4d1e7cb0f.jpg,"New research from UT Health San Antonio links obesity to dementia, highlighting the role of leptin, a hormone regulating body weight. Higher leptin levels correlate with improved brain white matter integrity in middle-aged adults, suggesting its deficiency could signal early cognitive impairment related to Alzheimer's or vascular dementia. The study involved 2,262 participants from the Framingham Heart Study and found that leptin markers were associated with cognitive function and brain health. These findings underscore leptin's potential neuroprotective role, indicating that managing obesity may reduce dementia risk.",MedicalXpress
$100m Funding Allows UK Biotech to Refile Rejected Antifungal,2024-09-20 06:33:00,https://pharmaphorum.com/news/armed-100m-funding-f2g-prepares-refile-antifungal,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638624107769823360-66ed15e4200d2676c39ea330.jpg,"UK biotech F2G has raised $100 million to advance the development of its oral antifungal candidate, olorofim, for invasive fungal infections after a previous FDA rejection. The funding will support late-stage trials and regulatory review, aiming to address the lack of new therapies for such infections. Olorofim, a novel orotomide antifungal, targets serious conditions like invasive aspergillosis, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The financing was led by the AMR Action Fund, highlighting the urgent need for new treatments as existing options face rising resistance. F2G retains North American rights while Shionogi holds licenses in Europe and Asia.",Pharmaphorum

The therapy aims to address the genetic cause of XLRS through a one-time subretinal injection. The designation offers benefits like market exclusivity and tax credits for clinical trials. The company is currently enrolling participants in a phase 1/2 trial and plans to include pediatric patients soon, while also preparing for discussions with the FDA regarding a phase 3 trial.",Healio
GLP-1 Drugs Decrease HbA1c & Body Weight in Type 1 Diabetes,2024-09-20 06:20:00,https://www.healio.com/news/endocrinology/20240919/offlabel-semaglutide-tirzepatide-lower-hba1c-and-body-weight-in-type-1-diabetes,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638624099940948841-66ed1345427e3fe2df75fd06.jpg,"Adults with type 1 diabetes using off-label semaglutide or tirzepatide experienced significant reductions in body weight and HbA1c compared to those not on these medications. A study found that tirzepatide users had a 21.4% weight loss and a 0.68% decrease in HbA1c, while semaglutide users lost 9.1% of their body weight and had a 0.54% HbA1c reduction. Both treatments were associated with decreased insulin requirements, and no serious adverse events were reported. Researchers emphasize the need for randomized controlled trials to further evaluate these medications' efficacy and safety in this population.",Healio

FDA Approves Pembrolizumab/Chemotherapy First-Line Use in Advanced Mesothelioma,2024-09-19 07:52:00,https://www.targetedonc.com/view/fda-approves-frontline-pembrolizumab-chemotherapy-in-advanced-mesothelioma,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638623291367570175-66ebd796200d2676c39ea2d6.jpg,"The FDA has approved pembrolizumab (Keytruda) combined with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma. This decision is based on the KEYNOTE-483 trial results, which demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chemotherapy alone. The combination reduced the risk of death by 21%, with median OS of 17.3 months versus 16.1 months for chemotherapy alone. The overall response rate was also notably higher at 62% with the combination treatment. Safety profiles were consistent with previous reports.",Targeted Oncology
Molnupiravir Modestly Lowers Risk of Severe COVID-19 Symptoms ,2024-09-19 07:47:00,https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20240918/molnupiravir-cuts-risk-for-severe-covid19-symptoms-and-possibly-long-covid,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638623288814372145-66ebd659427e3fe2df75fc65.jpg,"A recent randomized controlled trial indicates that the antiviral molnupiravir modestly reduces the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and may lower the risk of long COVID. The PANORAMIC trial showed that while molnupiravir did not reduce hospitalization risk for vaccinated adults, it accelerated recovery by four days. Among over 25,000 participants, treatment led to fewer and less severe symptoms, with modest effect sizes. Experts suggest that while antivirals can help high-risk individuals, their impact on long COVID is limited, and further research is needed to optimize their use in prevention and treatment.",Healio
