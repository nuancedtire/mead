China Approves Fulzerasib for Advanced KRAS G12C+ Lung Cancer,"Aug 23, 2024, 08:50 AM",https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/fulzerasib-receives-approval-in-china-for-advanced-kras-g12c-nsclc,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638599998154588059-66c84ae04e2a8b3bb8355674.jpg,CancerNetwork,"Fulzerasib, an investigational KRAS G12C inhibitor, has been approved by China's NMPA for treating advanced KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in adults post prior systemic therapy. The drug showed promising results in a phase 2 study with a 49.1% objective response rate and a 90.5% disease control rate. Fulzerasib works by irreversibly altering the cysteine residue of the KRAS G12C protein, leading to downstream pathway inhibition and tumor cell apoptosis. This approval signifies a major advancement in precision medicine for lung cancer patients with KRAS G12C mutations.",https://pharmacontent.blob.core.windows.net/images/638599998154588059-66c84ae04e2a8b3bb8355674.jpg

Factors like male sex, non-White ethnicity, smoking, and lack of insurance were associated with higher discontinuation rates. The review emphasized the importance of addressing modifiable factors to improve adherence. Studies included in the review showed varied rates of discontinuation and identified sociodemographic factors influencing discontinuation. The review also highlighted the need for further research to understand the specific causes of statin discontinuation and its impact on cardiovascular health.",https://pharmacontent.blob.core.windows.net/images/638599071289069006-66c6e25a6157181811bbc65d.jpg
