Conducted by Han Ah Lee and colleagues, the meta-analysis included 27 studies and 169,911 participants. Key findings revealed optimal cut-off values for both tests, enhancing risk stratification for HCC surveillance post-SVR. Despite promising results, the study noted limitations due to retrospective data and variability in methodologies, highlighting the need for further prospective research to validate findings and improve clinical guidelines.",HCPLive

They advocated for a holistic approach, considering all data points and individual circumstances rather than relying on a single metric. While HbA1c has been the gold standard for assessing diabetes complications, it is less effective for daily management. CGM offers more data but also has its limitations, including issues with defining time in range and hypoglycemia. Providers should personalize care based on comprehensive data and individual goals.",Healio
