Nearly 70% of Inhalers Misused by Hospitalized COPD Patients,2024-09-05 07:09:00,https://www.healio.com/news/pulmonology/20240830/hospitalized-patients-with-copd-misuse-nearly-70-of-inhalers,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638611169211727808-66d957c16157181811bbcafe.jpg,"A study revealed high inhaler misuse rates in hospitalized COPD patients, with 69.4% of inhalers being misused at admission. Inhaler misuse was identified through critical errors in inhalation technique and insufficient peak inspiratory flow. Researchers found that targeted teaching sessions by physiotherapists reduced the number of inhalers with critical errors. Suboptimal inhaler use can lead to poor disease control, more hospitalizations, and increased costs. The study emphasizes the importance of assessing inhalation technique, providing education, and ensuring the inhaler matches the patient's needs. Future research will focus on evaluating the intervention's impact on symptom control and disease progression in outpatient care.",Healio
