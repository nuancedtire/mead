They advocated for a holistic approach, considering all data points and individual circumstances rather than relying on a single metric. While HbA1c has been the gold standard for assessing diabetes complications, it is less effective for daily management. CGM offers more data but also has its limitations, including issues with defining time in range and hypoglycemia. Providers should personalize care based on comprehensive data and individual goals.",Healio

Inhaler misuse was identified through critical errors in inhalation technique and insufficient peak inspiratory flow. Researchers found that targeted teaching sessions by physiotherapists reduced the number of inhalers with critical errors. Suboptimal inhaler use can lead to poor disease control, more hospitalizations, and increased costs. The study emphasizes the importance of assessing inhalation technique, providing education, and ensuring the inhaler matches the patient's needs. Future research will focus on evaluating the intervention's impact on symptom control and disease progression in outpatient care.",Healio
