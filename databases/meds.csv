Nearly 70% of Inhalers Misused by Hospitalized COPD Patients,2024-09-05 07:09:00,https://www.healio.com/news/pulmonology/20240830/hospitalized-patients-with-copd-misuse-nearly-70-of-inhalers,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638611169211727808-66d957c16157181811bbcafe.jpg,"A study revealed high inhaler misuse rates in hospitalized COPD patients, with 69.4% of inhalers being misused at admission. Inhaler misuse was identified through critical errors in inhalation technique and insufficient peak inspiratory flow. Researchers found that targeted teaching sessions by physiotherapists reduced the number of inhalers with critical errors. Suboptimal inhaler use can lead to poor disease control, more hospitalizations, and increased costs. The study emphasizes the importance of assessing inhalation technique, providing education, and ensuring the inhaler matches the patient's needs. Future research will focus on evaluating the intervention's impact on symptom control and disease progression in outpatient care.",Healio
Plant-based Fats Lower CV Disease & Diabetes Risks,2024-09-05 07:02:00,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20240902/Plant-based-fats-outperform-dairy-fats-in-reducing-heart-disease-and-diabetes-risks.aspx,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638611164947496772-66d956314e2a8b3bb8355d40.jpg,A recent study found that substituting saturated fats from dairy with plant-based unsaturated fats can significantly lower cardiometabolic risks. The researchers emphasize the need for further validation of these findings across diverse populations.,News Medical Life Sciences

This marks the first drug approved for directly treating Rett syndrome symptoms. The pivotal LAVENDER trial showed significant improvements in patient assessments over 12 weeks. Subsequent open-label studies, LILAC-1 and LILAC-2, evaluated long-term safety and efficacy in younger patients. While the treatment shows promise, common side effects like diarrhea may necessitate dosage adjustments. Overall, Percy noted the treatment's potential impact on the management of Rett syndrome.",Contemporary Pediatrics
Phase 3 Trials Set for Vaxcyte's 31-Valent Pneumococcal Vaccine,2024-09-05 06:34:00,https://www.contagionlive.com/view/vaxcyte-announces-positive-results-for-pneumococcal-vaccine,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638611148786322582-66d94f884e2a8b3bb8355d3b.jpg,"Vaxcyte, Inc. reported positive results from its Phase 1/2 study of VAX-31, a 31-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, involving 1,015 adults aged 50 and older. The vaccine demonstrated strong immune responses and was well tolerated, exceeding regulatory standards compared to Prevnar 20. VAX-31 aims to provide over 95% coverage against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), addressing public health needs for broader protection due to rising antibiotic resistance. Vaxcyte plans to initiate a Phase 3 study by mid-2025 and a Phase 2 study for infants in early 2025, marking significant advancements in pneumococcal vaccination.",Contagion Live

This approval enhances access to genomic testing and aids in personalized treatment decisions. The FoundationOne tests analyze over 300 cancer-related genes from blood or tissue samples, addressing the critical need for effective first-line treatment options for this patient population. This marks Foundation Medicine's seventh FDA-approved companion diagnostic for prostate cancer.",Targeted Oncology
