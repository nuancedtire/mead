FDA Grants Priority Review to Mirdametinib in Neurofibromatosis ,2024-08-30 08:01:00,https://www.contemporarypediatrics.com/view/priority-review-given-to-mirdametinib-to-treat-nf1-pn-in-children-adults,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638606016653650935-66d17aa86157181811bbc863.jpg,"The FDA granted Priority Review Designation to SpringWorks Therapeutics for mirdametinib, a MEK inhibitor for treating neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN) in adult and pediatric patients. NF1 is a rare genetic disorder caused by NF1 gene variants. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date for the New Drug Application is February 28, 2025. Results from the phase 2b ReNeu trial showed promising outcomes, including improved pain and quality of life. SpringWorks aims to provide a new treatment option for NF1 patients, addressing the significant unmet medical need in this patient population.",Contemporary Pediatrics
Study Emulates RWE Data Effectiveness of Blood Thinners,2024-08-30 07:52:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638606011219456220-66d1779b4e2a8b3bb83558de.jpg,"A study led by Emma Maud Powell at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine aimed to emulate a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of blood thinners, apixaban and warfarin, in preventing strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation using real-world clinical data. Results showed that patients prescribed apixaban had similar outcomes to those on warfarin, but differences were noted due to factors like the quality of warfarin control and dosing of apixaban. The study highlighted the importance of using existing trials as a guide for observational analysis to estimate treatment effects and risks in patient groups not well represented in clinical trials.",Eureka News
Balanced Amino Acids Infusion Lowers Risk of Kidney Injury,2024-08-30 07:36:00,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2403769,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638606002082997176-66d17521ac48c5e342a26033.jpg,A study investigated the impact of administering an intravenous balanced mixture of amino acids to adults undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The results showed that the amino acid treatment led to a decrease in the occurrence of acute kidney injury compared to a placebo.,The New England Journal Of Medicine
Unique Bacterial Lipids Targets for Novel Antibiotic Development,2024-08-29 08:38:00,https://www.drugdiscoverynews.com/velcro-like-antibiotic-may-inform-new-antibiotic-design-16028,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638605175224954478-66d0324a6157181811bbc82f.jpg,"The research team led by Markus Weingarth at Utrecht University is studying the antibiotic plectasin, which targets unique lipids found in bacterial membranes. Plectasin forms dense structures on bacterial membranes by binding to lipid II, a building block of bacteria cell walls. This mechanism of action is different from conventional antibiotics as plectasin targets lipid II specifically based on both structure and charge, making it highly selective. While plectasin is effective against gram-positive bacteria and shows promise as a therapeutic, its future remains uncertain due to discontinued clinical development. The study's findings have implications for designing new antibiotics targeting lipid II.",Google Alerts <googlealerts-noreply@google.com>
