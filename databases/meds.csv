Unique Bacterial Lipids Targets for Novel Antibiotic Development,2024-08-29 08:38:00,https://www.drugdiscoverynews.com/velcro-like-antibiotic-may-inform-new-antibiotic-design-16028,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638605175224954478-66d0324a6157181811bbc82f.jpg,"The research team led by Markus Weingarth at Utrecht University is studying the antibiotic plectasin, which targets unique lipids found in bacterial membranes. Plectasin forms dense structures on bacterial membranes by binding to lipid II, a building block of bacteria cell walls. This mechanism of action is different from conventional antibiotics as plectasin targets lipid II specifically based on both structure and charge, making it highly selective. While plectasin is effective against gram-positive bacteria and shows promise as a therapeutic, its future remains uncertain due to discontinued clinical development. The study's findings have implications for designing new antibiotics targeting lipid II.",Google Alerts <googlealerts-noreply@google.com>

Diabetes Drugs May Lower Risk of Developing Dementia,2024-08-29 08:17:00,https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1055806,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638605162654079998-66d02d1a6157181811bbc82b.jpg,"A study from Korea published in The BMJ suggests that using SGLT-2 inhibitors to treat type 2 diabetes may reduce the risk of developing dementia, with greater benefits observed with longer treatment. The study involved over 110,000 adults with type 2 diabetes and found a 35% reduced risk of dementia associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors compared to DPP-4 inhibitors.Risk reduction was more pronounced for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The study highlights the need for randomized controlled trials to confirm these findings and explore the potential neuroprotective effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors. ",Eureka News

The study analyzed pre-diagnostic metabolomes of UK Biobank participants and used Mendelian randomization to assess effects on urate levels. Additionally, a separate study found that higher serum uric acid levels were linked to increased frailty in older adults, suggesting a role for uric acid as a pro-aging factor and a potential biomarker for frailty detection.",HCPLive
Alzheimer’s Prevalence Less Likely in MS Patients,2024-08-28 06:41:00,https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/08/27/ms-patients-less-likely-alzheimers-study/,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638604240797637089-66cec5ed6157181811bbc788.jpg,"A study found that individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) have a lower likelihood of showing signs of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain, a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Researchers suggest that some aspect of MS biology or genetics may offer protection against Alzheimer's. The study used a blood test to detect amyloid-beta plaques and found that MS patients were about half as likely to have these plaques compared to individuals without MS. This protective effect was more pronounced in MS patients with a more typical disease profile. Understanding these protective factors could potentially inform future therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.",Multiple Sclerosis News Today

By using stereoprobes designed to bind irreversibly to proteins, they identified key protein targets essential for cancer cell growth. This dual approach provides a more detailed understanding of protein interactions than past methods, potentially leading to the development of more effective and precise cancer treatments. The findings were published in Nature Chemistry, showcasing a novel strategy to target specific protein regions critical for cancer cell survival.",Eureka News
