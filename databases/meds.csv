High levels of specific glycopeptides may predict better responses to the combination therapy over sunitinib. This exploratory research suggests the need for further investigation into glycopeptide biomarkers for RCC treatment outcomes, highlighting the potential role of protein glycosylation in cancer prognosis and therapy response.

Additionally, there was a numerically lower incidence of gout-related outcomes with ertugliflozin. These findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors like ertugliflozin may benefit patients with T2D who are at risk for gout, warranting further research to confirm these results.",HCPLive
COPD Costs Costs to Double to $60 billion by 2029,2024-09-26 06:55:00,https://www.healio.com/news/pulmonology/20240925/costs-attributable-to-copd-in-2029-projected-to-nearly-double-2019-estimated-costs,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638629305040250450-66f50058427e3fe2df7601b4.jpg,"The projected cost of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in the U.S. is expected to reach $60.5 billion by 2029, nearly double the 2019 estimate of $31.3 billion. A study evaluated 4,135 COPD patients and highlighted significant comorbidities. Women incurred higher costs than men, and the elderly (65+) had the highest costs. The findings aim to inform policymakers and clinicians about the economic burden of COPD, emphasizing the need for improved prevention and management strategies as the population ages. Future research is encouraged to explore cost variations across demographics and states.",Healio
Trial Starts for Rare Steroid-Refractory Acute Graft vs. Host Disease,2024-09-27 09:17:00,https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/realta-patient-agvhd-trial/,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638630254598174533-66f677222507aba99c23c02d.jpg,"ReAlta Life Sciences has initiated a Phase II clinical trial for RLS-0071 to treat steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). This open-label, dose-escalation study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of RLS-0071, administered alone or with ruxolitinib, over seven or 14 days. The investigational drug, based on ReAlta’s EPICC peptide platform, has received orphan drug and fast track designations from the FDA. The company is also conducting additional Phase II trials for other conditions, including newborns with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.",Clinical Trials Arena
EUROASPIRE Studies Indicate OGTT Better Identifies Diabetes,2024-09-27 09:11:00,https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(24)00201-8,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638630250799333772-66f6758d427e3fe2df760299.jpg,"This study compares the diagnostic and predictive performance of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in detecting glucose perturbations among patients with coronary artery disease. Analyzing data from 16,259 patients across Europe, it found that OGTT identified significantly more cases of newly detected type 2 diabetes than HbA1c. The two-hour post-load glucose (2hPG) was identified as a stronger predictor of cardiovascular events compared to HbA1c, suggesting that 2hPG should be the primary screening tool for dysglycaemia in this patient population.",TheLancet_DiabetesEndocrinology
Tozorakimab Shows Efficacy in Various COPD Subgroups,2024-09-27 09:03:00,https://www.healio.com/news/pulmonology/20240925/tozorakimab-may-benefit-adults-with-copd-plus-bronchitis,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638630245798131711-66f673c9200d2676c39ea91f.jpg,"A recent study presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress suggests that tozorakimab (600 mg every 4 weeks) may improve lung function in adults with COPD and chronic bronchitis. The phase 2a FRONTIER-4 trial showed a numerical benefit in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 and a reduced risk of COPD worsening events compared to placebo. While tozorakimab demonstrated efficacy across various subgroups, it was associated with a higher incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Overall, findings indicate potential for tozorakimab as a new biologic treatment for COPD, particularly in high-risk patients.",Healio
