Rubella Infection Raises MS Risk in the Non-immunised,2024-09-10 09:20:00,https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/09/09/ms-risk-unvaccinated-people-elevated-rubella-infection-study/,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638615568331040849-66e00dfc6157181811bbccdd.jpg,"A Swedish study suggests that having antibodies against the rubella virus may increase the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) in unvaccinated individuals. The research indicates that rubella infection could be a potential risk factor for MS, supporting the idea that certain viral infections may trigger the immune responses linked to the disease. The study found that unvaccinated MS patients had a significantly higher presence of rubella antibodies compared to healthy controls. Researchers caution that further studies are necessary to confirm these findings and understand the mechanisms involved, particularly the role of molecular mimicry.",Multiple Sclerosis News Today
