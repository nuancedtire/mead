New Data Bolsters First-Line Combo Approach in Kidney Cancer,2024-09-20 06:44:00,https://www.targetedonc.com/view/first-line-treatment-for-kidney-cancer-new-data-strengthens-combo-approach,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638624114412447624-66ed192a191936c4d1e7cb10.jpg,"A post hoc analysis from the CheckMate-9ER study reveals that increased fucosylation and sialylation of serum proteins are negative prognostic indicators for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nivolumab plus cabozantinib or sunitinib. High levels of specific glycopeptides may predict better responses to the combination therapy over sunitinib. This exploratory research suggests the need for further investigation into glycopeptide biomarkers for RCC treatment outcomes, highlighting the potential role of protein glycosylation in cancer prognosis and therapy response. The study was presented at the 2024 ESMO Congress.",Targeted Oncology
Neurodegenerative Disorders Detected by Leptin Deficiency,2024-09-20 06:38:00,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-09-higher-leptin-brain-late-life.html,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638624110791211292-66ed176c191936c4d1e7cb0f.jpg,"New research from UT Health San Antonio links obesity to dementia, highlighting the role of leptin, a hormone regulating body weight. Higher leptin levels correlate with improved brain white matter integrity in middle-aged adults, suggesting its deficiency could signal early cognitive impairment related to Alzheimer's or vascular dementia. The study involved 2,262 participants from the Framingham Heart Study and found that leptin markers were associated with cognitive function and brain health. These findings underscore leptin's potential neuroprotective role, indicating that managing obesity may reduce dementia risk.",MedicalXpress

The PANORAMIC trial showed that while molnupiravir did not reduce hospitalization risk for vaccinated adults, it accelerated recovery by four days. Among over 25,000 participants, treatment led to fewer and less severe symptoms, with modest effect sizes. Experts suggest that while antivirals can help high-risk individuals, their impact on long COVID is limited, and further research is needed to optimize their use in prevention and treatment.",Healio
