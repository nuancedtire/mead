New Analysis Identifies Critical Proteins in Cancer Growth,"Aug 27, 2024, 06:32 AM",https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1055729,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638603371363536957-66cd7157ac48c5e342a25f0f.jpg,Eureka News,"A team of chemists at Scripps Research in La Jolla, CA, has combined two methods of protein analysis to map over 300 small molecule-reactive cancer proteins and their binding sites. By using stereoprobes designed to bind irreversibly to proteins, they identified key protein targets essential for cancer cell growth. This dual approach provides a more detailed understanding of protein interactions than past methods, potentially leading to the development of more effective and precise cancer treatments. The findings were published in Nature Chemistry, showcasing a novel strategy to target specific protein regions critical for cancer cell survival.",https://pharmacontent.blob.core.windows.net/images/638603371363536957-66cd7157ac48c5e342a25f0f.jpg
FDA Approves Automated Insulin Dosing Device in Type 2 Diabetes,"Aug 27, 2024, 06:23 AM",https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-clears-first-device-to-enable-automated-insulin-dosing-for-individuals-with-type-2-diabetes-302230838.html,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638603365792184149-66cd7043ac48c5e342a25f0e.jpg,PR Newswire ClinicalTrials Medical Discoveries,"The U.S. FDA has expanded the indications of the Insulet SmartAdjust technology for managing type 2 diabetes in addition to type 1 diabetes. This automated glycemic controller connects to an ACE pump and iCGM to adjust insulin delivery. The FDA reviewed a clinical study demonstrating improved blood sugar control with no serious adverse events. This clearance offers a new automated option, potentially reducing the burden of managing type 2 diabetes. The technology was reviewed via the 510(k) premarket clearance pathway.",https://pharmacontent.blob.core.windows.net/images/638603365792184149-66cd7043ac48c5e342a25f0e.jpg
