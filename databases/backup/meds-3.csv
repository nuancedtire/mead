Study Emulates RWE Data Effectiveness of Blood Thinners,2024-08-30 07:52:00,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638606011219456220-66d1779b4e2a8b3bb83558de.jpg,"A study led by Emma Maud Powell at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine aimed to emulate a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of blood thinners, apixaban and warfarin, in preventing strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation using real-world clinical data. Results showed that patients prescribed apixaban had similar outcomes to those on warfarin, but differences were noted due to factors like the quality of warfarin control and dosing of apixaban. The study highlighted the importance of using existing trials as a guide for observational analysis to estimate treatment effects and risks in patient groups not well represented in clinical trials.",Eureka News

Unique Bacterial Lipids Targets for Novel Antibiotic Development,2024-08-29 08:38:00,https://www.drugdiscoverynews.com/velcro-like-antibiotic-may-inform-new-antibiotic-design-16028,https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638605175224954478-66d0324a6157181811bbc82f.jpg,"The research team led by Markus Weingarth at Utrecht University is studying the antibiotic plectasin, which targets unique lipids found in bacterial membranes. Plectasin forms dense structures on bacterial membranes by binding to lipid II, a building block of bacteria cell walls. This mechanism of action is different from conventional antibiotics as plectasin targets lipid II specifically based on both structure and charge, making it highly selective. While plectasin is effective against gram-positive bacteria and shows promise as a therapeutic, its future remains uncertain due to discontinued clinical development. The study's findings have implications for designing new antibiotics targeting lipid II.",Google Alerts <googlealerts-noreply@google.com>
