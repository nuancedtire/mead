- *AKI history doubles the risk of developing dementia,* drawing attention to the need for early monitoring.
- This study followed over 305,000 individuals aged 65+ in Stockholm, uncovering 47,938 cases of dementia over 12 years.
- Notably, AKI increased the occurrence of Lewy body dementia (DLB) by 88%, vascular dementia by 47%, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) by 31%. 
- Severe AKI linked to hospitalization poses a **61%** higher risk than less severe cases. 
- A dose-response relationship exists between the severity of AKI and dementia risk, reinforcing the need for comprehensive prevention strategies.  
- Age stratification revealed a staggering **four-fold increase in DLB and PDD risk** for those over 85 years.

These insights emphasize the importance of monitoring kidney function as part of dementia prevention strategies. Let's discuss how this can be integrated into clinical practice!

_Study:¬†[Acute Kidney Injury and Its Association With Dementia and Specific Dementia Types: Findings From a Population-Based Study in Sweden.](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209751) Image Credit: crystal light / Shutterstock.com_

A recent study published in the journal¬†_[Neurology](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209751)_ examines the association between dementia risk and a prior history of acute kidney injury (AKI).

AKI and dementia
----------------

Dementia is a condition in which cognitive function declines progressively, thereby impacting the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). In 2019, about 55 million people were estimated to be affected by dementia.

Dementia is an incurable and progressive condition that requires active and comprehensive prevention strategies to reduce the public health burden and costs associated with its management. Several factors increase the risk of developing dementia, some of which include lower educational status, traumatic brain injury, midlife hypertension or obesity, diabetes, drinking, smoking, depression and social isolation, air pollution, and physical inactivity.

Like dementia, AKI increases the risk of adverse health outcomes, including death due to the development of heart and renal failure.

Preclinical studies indicate that AKI increases dementia risk. This association may involve multiple mechanisms, such as cerebrovascular pathology, autonomic dysfunction, abnormally low neurotransmitter levels, and neuroinflammation.

About the study
---------------

The current study involved 305,122 people 65 years and older in Stockholm, Sweden, who did not have a dementia diagnosis at baseline and had recorded kidney function measures. After a diagnosis of AKI, the study participants were monitored for any dementia.

Dementia occurrence was stratified by AKI history, the severity of AKI, AKI recurrence, and whether their kidney injury was community- or hospital-acquired.

What did the study show?
------------------------

The median participant age was 75 years, 57% of whom were women. During the follow-up period of 12 years, 79,888 cases of AKI and 47,938 cases of dementia were reported.

About 36% of the study cohort was diagnosed with hypertension, whereas 11% and 10% were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation, respectively. About 30% and 25% of the individuals were prescribed beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi and ARB), respectively. About 20% of the study cohort had stages three to five chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The mean age when AKI occurred was 77 years. Hypertension was the most common illness in the AKI subgroup, with a higher prevalence of 69% as compared to 36% in the entire study cohort.

The most frequently prescribed drugs reported in the AKI subgroup included ACEi, ARBs, or beta-blockers. Over 64% of individuals with AKI were also diagnosed with CKD.

Doubled risk of dementia after AKI
----------------------------------

A total of 37 cases of dementia for every 1,000 person-years (PY) was reported among people with a history of AKI. Comparatively, before the AKI incident, the dementia incidence was 17.3 for every 1,000 PY.

After compensating for other confounding factors, the occurrence of AKI was associated with a 50% increased risk of developing any type of dementia as compared to those without a history of AKI.

An increased risk of dementia was associated with Lewy bodies (DLB)/Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) by 88%, 47%, and 31%, respectively.

Severe AKI that required hospitalization rather than outpatient management was associated with an increased dementia risk. The risk was 45% higher after AKI stage one as compared to 61% higher following stages two and three.

Hospital-acquired and hospital-managed AKI was also associated with a 55% higher dementia risk as compared to 31% for community-acquired/community-managed AKI. This risk was similarly increased at 48% and 39% for patients with two and three recurrences of AKI, respectively.

The impact of AKI on different types of dementia
------------------------------------------------

The risk of DLB and PDD was 88% higher in individuals with a history of AKI as compared to an increased risk of 47% and 31% for vascular dementia and AD, respectively. In general, specific dementia types were more common with recurrent AKI and increased AKI severity.

The most common type of dementia was AD, with a total of 17,663 cases from 47,938 dementia diagnoses. Vascular dementia, DLB, PDD, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) accounted for 29.7%, 3.6%, and 1% of dementia cases, respectively.

Age-stratified analyses identified a four-fold increased risk of DLB and PDD among those older than 85 years.

Conclusions
-----------

> _This study identifies individuals with AKI as a population at high risk of dementia who may benefit from close monitoring for early detection and implementation of antidementia strategies_.‚Äù

The study findings confirm previous studies reporting a two-fold risk of dementia among people hospitalized with AKI while also extending these observations to a broader patient sample over a longer duration. The researchers also identified a dose-response relationship between dementia risk and AKI history, thus supporting a causal association between these two diseases.

2024-09-03 06:53:00,2024-09-04 02:18:46,"üö® Exciting Update in Diabetes Monitoring! üö®

Recent research from Klick Labs published in _Scientific Reports_ reveals a significant link between blood glucose levels and voice pitch in individuals with Type 2 diabetes.

Key Takeaways:
- **Study Scope:** Analyzed voice frequency changes in 505 participants (non-diabetic, prediabetic, Type 2 diabetic) with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).
- **Findings:** A linear correlation was found; higher blood glucose levels lead to an increase in voice pitch frequency.
- **Implications:** This breakthrough could pave the way for non-invasive, voice-based glucose monitoring, making it as simple as speaking into a smartphone.
- **Future Research:** Highlights the necessity to expand research into vocal biomarkers for diabetes management and monitoring.

===================================================================================================

As part of its ongoing exploration of vocal biomarkers and the role they can play in enhancing health outcomes, Klick Labs published a new study in _Scientific Reports_ today ‚Äì confirming the link between blood glucose levels and voice pitch and opening the door to future advancements in non-invasive glucose monitoring for people living with Type 2 diabetes.

In ""_Linear Effects of Glucose Levels on Voice Fundamental Frequency in Type 2 diabetes and Individuals with Normoglycemia_,"" researchers investigated how blood glucose levels influence the frequency of the voice in 505 participants across three glycemic statuses ‚Äì non-diabetic, prediabetic, and Type-2 diabetic. Participants were fitted with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and recorded their voices multiple times daily for two weeks. The analysis revealed a linear relationship where an increase in CGM glucose levels corresponded to an increase in the fundamental frequency in the voice.

> By establishing a significant positive association between glucose levels and fundamental frequency, our study provides compelling justification for more research on using voice to predict and monitor glucose levels. Whereas current glucose monitoring methods are often invasive and inconvenient, voice-based glucose monitoring could be as easy as talking into a smartphone, which could change the game for the estimated 463 million people around the world living with Type 2 diabetes.""

> Jaycee Kaufman, lead author and scientist at Klick Labs

Klick Labs' latest research marks another step forward in its ongoing commitment to revolutionizing the detection and management of diabetes using voice tech and machine learning. Their October 2023 study in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health_ demonstrated that voice and AI can screen for Type 2 diabetes with high accuracy. Previously, their _""Screening for Impaired Glucose Homeostasis: A Novel Metric of Glycemic Control""_ research also appeared in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health_ (May 2023), and their _""Homeostasis as a proportional‚Äìintegral control system""_ study was published in _Nature Digital Medicine_ (May 2020).

=============== 

Moderna's RSV vaccine is the third approved for the treatment of people aged 60 and over.

The European Commission on Friday approved Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults‚Äîthe first time the bloc has authorised an mRNA shot against a disease other than COVID-19.

RSV is a highly contagious seasonal virus that can cause severe symptoms in infants and the elderly‚Äîone in 20 of whom contract it each year in Europe, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

In the European Union, Norway and United Kingdom, RSV leads to the hospitalization of around 158,000 adults each year, as well as some 213,000 children under five, according to ECDC data.

""Vaccination saves lives,"" the EU's commissioner for health and food safety, Stella Kyriakides, said in a statement announcing the approval of Moderna's mResvia vaccine.

""We are determined to ensure that everyone has access to the protection that they need against serious diseases.""

The authorization, which follows a similar step by the US Food and Drug Administration in May, is based on a positive assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in June.

The EMA approved the use of mResvia for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD), which is caused by RSV, in adults of 60 and older.

The EU had previously approved two vaccines for protecting against RSV, manufactured by Pfizer and GSK.

GSK and Pfizer's vaccines rely on traditional technology: introducing a pathogen component to the immune system to trigger a response.

In contrast, Moderna's vaccine utilizes cutting-edge messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, instructing the body to produce a unique protein that stimulates an immune response, teaching it to defend against the infection.

""This approval of the first mRNA vaccine against RSV clearly shows the importance of innovation when it comes to protecting the health of our citizens,"" Kyriakides said.

Stephane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive, said the commission's approval was ""an important milestone for public health and highlights Moderna's mRNA leadership.""

==========================================================================

With 1k new patients a month, the company has almost quadrupled its revenue in one year
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4 min read

UK-based healthtech Doccla has secured a ¬£35m Series B, led by European VC Lakestar, with new investors French VC Elaia and existing investors General Catalyst, Speedinvest and the investment leg of German media company Bertelsmann also participating.

Having almost quadrupled its annual revenue in 2023, it's planning its expansion in DACH and France, and says its German and French investors will help its international growth plans.

The startup, founded in 2019, makes ""virtual ward"" technology for healthcare providers. It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.

Doccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland‚Äôs Health Service Executive (HSE).

Doccla‚Äôs founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.

‚ÄúWith the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it‚Äôs a huge opportunity to scale,‚Äù says Ratz.

The virtual A&E

Sweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.

According to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.

Patients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.

So far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it‚Äôs adding 1k new patients every month.

‚ÄúOver time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,‚Äù Ratz says.

Partnering with pharma

Doccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).

‚ÄúWe have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,‚Äù Ratz says. ‚ÄúThis is because we are in very close contact with our patients.‚Äù

Doccla says it‚Äôs interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he‚Äôs seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.

With 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.

In one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.

‚ÄúWe can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits ‚Äî in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,‚Äù Ratz says.

Doccla has raised a total of ¬£52m to date.

In October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.",gpt-4o-mini

The round is made up of $80m in equity and $100m in debt ‚Äî and is tied to specific milestones. The fresh funding tops up the startup‚Äôs $130m Series C, raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.

It‚Äôs the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.

Caresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.

### AI for hospitals

Caresyntax says it wants to build the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals‚Äô surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.

The company‚Äôs platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.

While some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax‚Äôs platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.

‚ÄúEffectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,‚Äù they add.

If it does what it sets out to do, it‚Äôs a big opportunity.

Costs associated with operations account for 30% of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends 11% of GDP on health.

Founded in 2013 in Germany ‚Äî Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 ‚Äî its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company‚Äôs revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.

### The rise of smart surgery

The round comes on the back of a strong 18 months for startups developing tech for the operating theatre.

The meteoric rise of a new class of weight loss drugs over the past two years, known as GLP-1s, has seen a new name take the title of Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, helped a country dodge a recession and hit grocery sales in the US.

The valuations of the companies that make this so-called ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù class of drugs ‚Äî which includes Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and US rival Eli Lilly (maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) ‚Äî have soared as investors bet big on a medication projected by some to hit $150bn in sales by the early 2030s.

The potential of the market has not been lost on founders.

It‚Äôs a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù opportunity, says Kai Eberhardt, the founder and CEO of Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform which operates in the UK, France and Germany, alongside its home market. It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.

‚ÄúFor us [GLP-1 drugs] are already a strong growth driver,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.‚Äù

While treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva‚Äôs overall business ‚Äî Eberhardt says it‚Äôs growing total patient and revenue numbers by ‚Äúdouble digit‚Äù percentage points year-on-year ‚Äî the meds could become the startup‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest‚Äù growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.

### Riding the wave

Oviva‚Äôs not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity ‚Äî many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.

In the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart‚Äôs CEO, food sales have fallen as the one in eight adults in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, propping up Denmark‚Äôs GDP in the process.

All of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have convinced them to get out their chequebook: Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a ‚Ç¨10m Series A in August 2023 a year on from a ‚Ç¨3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised ‚Ç¨3.1m last summer.

Many startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn‚Äôt start life offering them ‚Äî largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.

UK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs health‚Äù brand, but has recently changed that. The company‚Äôs website uses images of men and women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.

Yazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.

Meurling tells Sifted it had hit ‚Ç¨14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It‚Äôs now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.

Other startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men‚Äôs sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.

‚Äú[GLP-1 meds] are a game changer,‚Äù says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be ‚Äústrange‚Äù if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn‚Äôt looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.

While GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the ‚Äúhype‚Äù surrounding the drug class has ‚Äúopened doors‚Äù for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler ‚Äî adding that the startup managed to raise its ‚Ç¨400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It‚Äôs now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it‚Äôll look to target US employers ‚Äî who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.

### Kinks in the supply chain

There are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector ‚Äî not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.

Some of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate‚Äôs $100m in 2021 and Form Health‚Äôs $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than ‚Ç¨10m in a single round.

Investors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics ‚Äî Manual was still selling past the deadline.

If a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.

‚ÄúAs there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.‚Äù

### Who‚Äôll stump up the cash?

There‚Äôs also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.

While Numan‚Äôs head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the ‚Äúsuccess of private sector companies offering GLP-1 [drugs] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS‚Äù, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won‚Äôt be enough to hit real scale.

‚ÄúUS investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts [selling to whole organisations like health insurers],‚Äù says Syhler. ‚ÄúThis means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care ‚Äî where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.‚Äù

In Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.

In the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.

Oviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS ‚Äî but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it‚Äôs in ‚Äúmature dialogues with several health systems‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,‚Äù says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that don‚Äôt always want to work with startups. Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.

Whether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen ‚Äî but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. ‚ÄúI've never been an investor in a company that‚Äôs got so much attention ‚Äî in a space that‚Äôs got so much attention,‚Äù says Arnardottir.",gpt-4o-mini

On Wednesday UK-based period tracking app Flo Health announced it had raised $200m ‚Äî pushing its valuation beyond $1bn and making it Europe‚Äôs first femtech unicorn.

It turned out to be a very buzzy story: as people were quick to point out online, Flo also became Europe‚Äôs first women‚Äôs health unicorn with an all-male founding team ‚Äî a detail which sparked a backlash online.

‚ÄúA company founded by men, led by men and funded by men became the first WOMEN'S health app to achieve unicorn status. If this doesn't show you everything that's wrong with the ecosystem, I don't know what will,‚Äù Anna-Sophie Hartvigsen, cofounder of investment learning app and community for women Female Invest, wrote in a viral LinkedIn post, citing stats on the lack of funding for female founders. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad that a femtech company is doing well,‚Äù she later added in the comments. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs bad that only men are able to succeed in this space.‚Äù

Some founders in the comments underneath Hartvigsen's post said that they‚Äôve struggled with fundraising as a woman; there was also a debate in a private WhatsApp group seen by Sifted about whether female founders should add a token male founder to their team in an effort to increase their chances of getting cheques. Someone in that group added that we won‚Äôt fix the trend of men funding men until there are more female investors.

But others didn‚Äôt see it that way.

‚ÄúThis achievement should actually be celebrated. As a women's health investor that has invested in 7+ women's health companies, we are yet to see any of them scale,‚Äù Deepali Nangia, a partner at Speedinvest, wrote in response to Hartvigsen‚Äôs LinkedIn post. ‚ÄúFlo's achievement is a very strong signal to the market that [direct to consumer] women's health is monetizable in Europe and that there is money to be made here; this is what investors need to see so more money flows into women's health companies. Not to say that the challenges faced by women in pitching are any less, but we must celebrate all wins that lead to more capital deployed into this sector,‚Äù she argued.

Nangia added that she wasn‚Äôt doubting there‚Äôs a problem, ‚Äúbut every win should not be turned around to a problem‚Ä¶ Many people have been working on solving for this problem, which includes many women of course but also men.‚Äù

Another commenter added: ‚ÄúIf anything, let this be a door for more investors to look closely at the female health industry and invest their money there? Could this be an example of men allies? If it had to be a company founded and led by men, well thank you very much for opening the door, now let the rest go through.‚Äù

Priya Oberoi, partner at women‚Äôs health-focused VC Goddess Gaia Ventures, added: ‚ÄúFlo reaching series C [unicorn] status with 60 mln active users is a win for #womenshealth - helping to close that 131 year gender health gap and getting products and services out there to improve the lives of women.‚Äù

""We firmly believe that women's health has been critically overlooked, undervalued and underfunded for far too long,"" Flo said in a statement to Sifted. ""Our sincere hope is that Flo‚Äôs funding will inspire more investors to recognise the immense potential in this space."" The company added: ""We're proud to say that more than half (56%) of Flo's employees are women, including our leadership team.""

It‚Äôs an important debate, and, readers, I‚Äôm curious to hear your thoughts: why aren‚Äôt there more female-founded femtech unicorns?

=====================================================

**TOPLINE:**
------------

Higher thiazide doses are linked to greater reductions in urine calcium levels, which correlate with fewer symptomatic kidney stone events. This association suggests that adjusting thiazide dosage could be crucial in kidney stone prevention.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   The efficacy of using thiazides for kidney stone prevention was called into question by [the NOSTONE trial](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2209275), which found no added benefit of hydrochlorothiazide over a placebo in preventing kidney stone recurrence in high-risk patients.
*   Using the Medicare-Litholink Database, researchers identified adult participants with kidney stones prescribed thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, or indapamide) within 6 months after initial 24-hour urine collection and who underwent follow-up urine collections between 30 and 180 days after their first thiazide prescription fill.
*   Thiazide dosages were classified as:
    *   Low (chlorthalidone, < 12.5 mg/d; indapamide, < 0.6125 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, < 25 mg/d)
    *   Medium (chlorthalidone, 12.5 to < 25 mg/d; indapamide, 0.6125 to < 1.25 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, 25 to < 50 mg/d)
    *   High (chlorthalidone, ‚â• 25 mg/d; indapamide, ‚â• 1.25 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, ‚â• 50 mg/d)
*   Changes in calcium levels in response to low, medium, and high thiazide dosages were evaluated. These changes were correlated with the incidence of symptomatic stone events, identified by emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or surgeries for stones within 6-48 months after the initial prescription fill.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   Researchers included 634 adults with kidney stones (mean age, 67.6 years; 46.5% women).
*   Higher thiazide doses were associated with greater reductions in urine calcium levels, with a low dose resulting in an 18.9% reduction, a medium dose in a 25.5% reduction, and a high dose in a 28.4% reduction (_P_ = .02).
*   At 4 years, the adjusted cumulative incidence of symptomatic stone events was 28.8%, 19.5%, and 18.0% for a low, an intermediate, and a high tercile of change in urine calcium levels, respectively, after thiazide prescription (_P_ = .04 for trend).

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

Considering the study's findings, experts from the University of California, San Francisco, and other institutions wrote in [an accompanying editorial](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.28927) that ""clinicians need to first identify patients with hypercalciuria and then aggressively treat them with thiazide diuretics to yield the most benefit in reducing kidney stone recurrence,"" adding, ""However, most clinicians likely prefer to start at low dosages and then titrate the dosage based on adverse effects and efficacy.""

**SOURCE:**

It was published [online](https://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.28953&utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2024.28953) in _JAMA Network Open_.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

This study's limitations included the possibility of omitted variable bias and unmeasured differences between participants prescribed different dosages of thiazides. The sample consisted mostly of older adults, potentially limiting generalizability.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

This study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. The authors declared no conflicts of interests.

===============

This site is intended for UK healthcare professionals

TOPLINE:
--------

In the first meta-analysis of its kind, Swiss researchers find that only 14% of men treated for testicular cancer develop infertility. This is very reassuring considering that the majority of cancer survivors, up to 77%, express interest in paternity after completing cancer treatment.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

* A meta-analysis of 30 studies of fertility, with 13,718 men after unilateral testicular cancer. In all, 25 of the studies were from Europe, four were from Asia, and one was from the United States.
* Studies were identified by a search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases (2000-2022).
* Infertility, the primary outcome, was defined by azoospermia at least 12 months after oncological treatment, and failure to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of regular unprotected sexual intercourse and/or usage of cryosperm.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

* Treatment for testicular cancer included: active surveillance after unilateral orchidectomy (32.7%); radiotherapy (23.1%); standard- or low-dose chemotherapy (33.7%); and high-dose chemotherapy (1.4%).
* In a quantitative synthesis of 23 of the 30 studies, the overall pooled infertility prevalence was 14% (95% CI, 9%-21%).
* Azoospermia was observed in 8% (95% CI, 6%-12%).
* In the subgroup analysis of patients with good prognosis who received standard therapy, infertility prevalence was only 4% (95% CI, 2%-10%).

IN PRACTICE:
------------

The authors concluded that ""Despite the low prevalence of infertility, it is still recommended to undergo sperm cryopreservation because of the uncertainty of the subsequent therapy and the lack of large longitudinal data on individual treatment effects.""

SOURCE:
-------

The lead and corresponding author is Janna Pape of the University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. The study appeared in _Andrology_.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Limitations included an observational data and a high heterogeneity across studies.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

None of the authors reported competing interests. Funding for the study was from the Swiss Cancer League.

**Key Points**

**Question**  
Is œâ-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA; ie, fish oil) supplementation during pregnancy associated with reduced risk of childhood atopic dermatitis (AD) in mothers carrying specific cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) genotypes?

**Findings**  
In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial including 635 mother-child pairs with 10-year follow-up, a reduced risk of childhood AD until age 10 years was found only for mothers carrying the COX1 TT genotype who received n-3 LCPUFA supplements. There was increased AD risk among children of mothers with the CC genotype and no association overall or for mothers carrying the CT genotype.

**Meaning**  
The findings support use of a personalized prevention strategy for reducing the burden of childhood AD by genotyping expecting mothers in early pregnancy and providing n-3 LCPUFA supplementation only to women carrying the COX1 TT genotype.

**Abstract**

**Importance**  
Eicosanoids have a pathophysiological role in atopic dermatitis (AD), but it is unknown whether this is affected by prenatal œâ-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA; ie, fish oil) supplementation and genetic variations in the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) pathway.

**Objective**  
To explore the association of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy with risk of childhood AD overall and by maternal COX1 genotype.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  
This prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial included mother-child pairs from the Danish Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 birth cohort, with prospective follow-up until children were aged 10 years. In the trial, maternal and child COX1 genotypes were determined, and urinary eicosanoids were quantified when the child was 1 year of age. The present study was conducted from January 2019 to December 2021, and data were analyzed from January to September 2023.

**Intervention**  
A total of 736 pregnant women at 24 weeks‚Äô gestation were randomized 1:1 to 2.4 g of n-3 LCPUFA (fish oil) or placebo (olive oil) per day until 1 week post partum.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  
Risk of childhood AD until age 10 years overall and by maternal COX1 genotype.

**Results**  
At age 10 years, 635 children (91%; 363 [57%] female) completed the clinical follow-up, and these mother-child pairs were included in this study; 321 (51%) were in the intervention group and 314 (49%) in the control group. Pregnancy n-3 LCPUFA supplementation was associated with lower urinary thromboxane A2 metabolites at age 1 year (Œ≤, ‚Äì0.46; 95% CI, ‚Äì0.80 to ‚Äì0.13; P = .006), which was also associated with COX1 rs1330344 genotype (Œ≤ per C allele, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.20-0.73; P = .001). Although neither n-3 LCPUFA supplementation (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.76-1.33; P = .97) nor maternal COX1 genotype (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.74-1.19; P = .60) was associated with risk of childhood AD until age 10 years, there was evidence of an interaction between these variables (P < .001 for interaction). Among mothers with the TT genotype, risk of AD was reduced in the n-3 LCPUFA group compared with the placebo group (390 mother-child pairs [61%]; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.98; P = .04); there was no association for mothers with the CT genotype (209 [33%]; HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.79-2.10; P = .31), and risk was increased among offspring of mothers with the CC genotype (37 [6%]; HR, 5.77; 95% CI, 1.63-20.47; P = .007). There was a significant interaction between n-3 LCPUFA supplementation and child COX1 genotype and development of AD (P = .002 for interaction).

**Conclusions and Relevance**  
In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, the association of prenatal n-3 LCPUFA supplementation with risk of childhood AD varied by maternal COX1 genotype. The findings could be used to inform a personalized prevention strategy of providing supplementation only to pregnant individuals with the TT genotype.

==================================================

Edited by Anushree Chaphalkar

September 02, 2024

**TOPLINE:**¬†
-------------

Compared with other urine analysis methods, urine Gram stain has a moderate predictive value for detecting gram-negative bacteria in urine culture but does not significantly improve urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis in the emergency department (ED).

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Researchers conducted an observational cohort study at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands, encompassing 1358 episodes across 1136 patients suspected of having a UTI.
*   The study included the following predefined subgroups: patients using urinary catheters and patients with leukopenia (< 4.0√ó10‚Åπ leucocytes/L). Urine dipstick nitrite, automated urinalysis, Gram stain, and urine cultures were performed on urine samples collected from patients presenting at the ED.
*   The sensitivity and specificity of Gram stain for ""many"" bacteria (quantified as > 15/high power field) were compared with those of urine dipstick nitrite and automated bacterial counting in urinalysis.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   The sensitivity and specificity of Gram stain for ""many"" bacteria were 51.3% and 91.0%, respectively, with an accuracy of 76.8%.
*   Gram stain showed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 84.7% for gram-negative rods in urine culture; however, the PPV was only 38.4% for gram-positive cocci.
*   In the catheter subgroup, the presence of monomorphic bacteria quantified as ""many"" had a higher PPV for diagnosing a UTI than the presence of polymorphic bacteria with the same quantification.
*   The overall performance of Gram stain in diagnosing a UTI in the ED was comparable to that of automated bacterial counting in urinalysis but better than that of urine dipstick nitrite.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""With the exception of a moderate prediction of gram-negative bacteria in the UC [urine culture], urine GS [Gram stain] does not improve UTI diagnosis at the ED compared to other urine parameters,"" the authors wrote.

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study was led by Stephanie J.M. Middelkoop, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands. It was [published online](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23744235.2024.2389478) on August 16, 2024, in *Infectious Diseases*.

**LIMITATIONS:**¬†
-----------------

The study's limitations included a small sample size within the leukopenia subgroup, which may have affected the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the potential influence of refrigeration of urine samples on bacterial growth could have affected the results. In this study, indwelling catheters were not replaced before urine sample collection, which may have affected the accuracy of UTI diagnosis in patients using catheters.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

No conflicts of interest were disclosed by the authors.

2024-09-02 02:59:00,2024-09-04 09:33:48,"In the evolving landscape of primary care, effective collaboration among healthcare teams is more crucial than ever. Here are some key takeaways for improving teamwork and communication:

- **Shared Objectives**: Establish a few meaningful goals that everyone is responsible for to foster trust and purpose.
- **Clear Roles**: Define roles and responsibilities clearly, and review them regularly to ensure efficient task completion.
- **Reflection & Feedback**: Regularly reflect on team dynamics, whether through meetings or casual check-ins, to maintain open communication and psychological safety.
- **Utilize Huddles**: Implement brief daily huddles to discuss tasks and patient specifics, promoting clarity and responsibility.
- **Leverage Technology**: Use digital tools for seamless access to patient records and enhance communication across care teams.
- **Physical Environment Matters**: Create shared workspaces to encourage real-time collaboration and integration among team members.
- **Supervision & Training**: Clinical supervision and ongoing training opportunities are essential for maintaining standards and supporting professional development.

As primary care continues to adapt, these strategies can help teams provide high-quality patient care while navigating the changes in their roles. Let's keep the conversation going on how best to support one another!

GPs‚Äô roles have changed enormously over the past few years. Having worked in the same practice for over 40 years, I perhaps see things from a different perspective, but I don‚Äôt think I am alone in this. I am a mentor to a few GPs in the national New to Practice Programme, and those I meet feel the same. The responsibility for making clinical decisions rests with GPs despite increasing involvement from other healthcare professionals. These practitioners have differing skill sets and lead on clinical areas that are rapidly changing; at present, these changes are not always shared with GPs. Better communication and understanding of any changes will enable more effective collaboration in primary care, facilitating provision of a quality service for patients‚Äîeven if the way primary care does this has changed.

### GPs as the Backstop 

One example of GPs charting unfamiliar territory when supporting the patients of another healthcare professional is evident in the management of diabetes. Many patients with diabetes are now managed by specialist diabetes nurses; however, when one of these patients has a problem and the nurse is unavailable, a GP is often asked to solve the problem. For significantly unwell patients, hospital admission is the best option, but for most queries, knowledge of current best practice in diabetes is needed. Fortunately, the regular general updates most GPs do with medical education providers such as NB Medical Education or Red Whale provide most of the answers.

Similarly, a pregnant patient may need medical advice the same day, but has been unable to contact the midwife team, so it falls to the GP. Some problems are not pregnancy related, such as respiratory infections. Others can present problems, such as aching calves with no abnormality found on examination. Testing the patient‚Äôs D-dimer level would not be helpful because it is raised in pregnancy anyway. Venous thromboembolism is more common in pregnant than nonpregnant women. GPs may feel unskilled, as midwife teams now look after most antenatal patients. Advice is on hand from the local obstetric unit‚Äîbut again, the clinician with the least experience is the first to be contacted.

### The Fundamentals of Effective Collaboration 

In well-developed practice teams, there is good communication, and complex problems are solved by adopting a multifaceted approach. So, how can primary care teams collaborate more effectively to achieve the best result?

Teams that work effectively together demonstrate a mixture of professional skills, mutual professional respect, and clear team communication. The King‚Äôs Fund has published a summary of how to achieve these elements of effective collaboration. The three main components are:

*   **a small number of meaningful objectives**‚Äîobjectives that team members are equally responsible for, to create a sense of shared purpose, trust, and collective achievement
*   **clear roles and responsibilities among team members**‚Äîoutlining what activities need to be done and by whom, to ensure that everything is completed and to clarify each member‚Äôs roles and strengths; this should be reviewed regularly
*   **reflection on how the team is working together**‚Äîthis can be in any form (for example, away days or team ‚Äòhuddles‚Äô), to cover both the technical aspects of work as well as how people are feeling; it is important that everyone feels safe to freely express themselves regardless of their role.

### Improving Communication and Teamwork 

Google‚Äôs 2-year research project into cultivating great teams found that the highest-performing teams had one thing in common‚Äîpsychological safety, or the belief that members can speak up or make mistakes without retribution. This is an important goal that primary care team leaders should aim for, as people become more creative, resilient, and motivated when they feel safe.

One way to improve communication is through huddles, which are short, frequent check-ins to discuss the day‚Äôs patients and tasks. Huddles can allow for the discussion of patient-specific issues and clarification of responsibilities.

Furthermore, digital communication tools, such as email and video conferencing, are also critical, as each team member will need access to shared patient records and booking systems to view and share information easily when needed‚Äîfor example, on home visits.

Finally, the physical environmental also plays a role in supporting new teams to function. Shared working spaces are the default location when team members are not seeing a patient, and these spaces have many benefits, such as improving integration and team cohesion, enabling real-time communication in huddles, and facilitating information sharing between team members. The King‚Äôs Fund highlights that team members are more likely to be sensitive to one another‚Äôs problems and appreciate each other‚Äôs roles when they have this sort of contact with each other.

### Ensuring Clinical Accountability and Supportive Management 

Clinical supervision, appraisals, and learning and development opportunities are essential to ensure that all team members are held to professional standards and encouraged to reflect on their own practice.

Clinical supervision and appraisals are essential requirements for all healthcare professionals. There are many effective models of clinical supervision, including one-to-one, group, or peer supervision. Clinical supervision should be developed by teams to meet their needs. Appraisals are a requirement in the NHS and should be focused on a shared understanding of team goals, two-way communication, and setting goals for the future. In addition, all team members need to have the skills, knowledge, and experience to deliver effective care. Identifying the needs of team members and ensuring access to training and opportunities to develop is critical for all healthcare professionals to maintain their registration and stay up to date with current practice.

The face of primary care is changing, and making sure that all team members stay on top of changes to their roles and responsibilities is important for fostering a harmonious and effective environment that encourages collaboration and enables provision of a superb service to patients. To those of you who are already doing all of this‚Äîwell done!",gpt-4o-mini

- **Approval Details**: Balversa (erdafitinib) can be used as a once-daily monotherapy for adults with FGFR3 alterations after prior therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor.
- **Evidence Backing**: The European approval is based on the phase 3 THOR study, showing Balversa reduced the risk of death by 36% vs. chemotherapy with a median survival of 12.1 months.
- **Treatment Pathways**: In contrast to the broader approval in the US allowing more second-line options, the EU label focuses on its use after immunotherapy.
- **Further Research**: Ongoing studies (THOR-2) are investigating Balversa in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and have shown promising preliminary results.
- **Sales Potential**: J&J anticipates this approval could propel sales beyond $1 billion, a significant milestone for bladder cancer therapeutics.

==============================================================

**Johnson & Johnson's Balversa has become the first drug approved in the EU to treat adults with advanced urothelial carcinoma (mUC) with FGFR3 genetic alterations after one line of prior therapy.**

The green light from the European Commission comes a few months after pan-FGFR inhibitor Balversa (erdafitinib) was cleared for the same indication in the US, with a different label than the drug had when it was granted an early, accelerated approval by the FDA in 2019.

As in the US, the EC has said that Balversa can be used as a once-daily monotherapy in patients previously treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, now a first-line therapy of choice of mUC, the most common form of bladder cancer.

Previously, the FDA cleared the drug for patients with FGFR2 alterations, and it could also be used for post-chemotherapy patients, regardless of whether they were eligible for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. The full US approval was wider in one respect, however, as it made Balversa an option broadly as a second-line therapy while it was previously only labelled for post-chemo use.

Bladder cancer saw few therapeutic advances for decades until the advent of checkpoint inhibitor therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, several of which are approved for either first- or second-line treatment of mUC.

The EU approval of Balversa is based on a subgroup of patients from the phase 3 THOR study, which compared the drug to chemotherapy in patients with advanced or mUC with FGFR alterations who had progressed on or after one or two prior treatments, at least one of which included an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drug.

In the Cohort 1 group, J&J's drug reduced the risk of death by 36% compared to chemo, with a median duration of survival of 12.1 months and 7.8 months, respectively. The study was also supposed to recruit FGFR2-altered mUC patients, but this is vanishingly rare and no subjects with that form were recruited into the trial.

A second subgroup (Cohort 2) compared Balversa to MSD's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in patients who had not previously been treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, but J&J's drug wasn't able to show an improvement in overall survival. As a result, the company is positioning its drug as an option for patients who still need treatment after immunotherapy.

J&J, meanwhile, is also testing Balversa in the THOR-2 study, which is comparing the drug to the investigator's choice of intravesical chemotherapy in patients with high-risk non‚Äìmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

Interim results reported at last year's ESMO congress revealed a 72% reduction in disease recurrence or death with erdafitinib, although tolerability was a problem, with a third of patients having to discontinue treatment with the drug.

Approval in that indication could help the drug achieve $1 billion-plus sales, according to J&J, although the drug still has a long way to go as sales are not high enough to be broken out in J&J's quarterly financial reporting.",gpt-4o-mini

Key Points 

**Question**  What are the prevalence, cardiac phenotypes, and outcomes of transthyretin gene (_TTR_) variants in the UK Biobank population?

**Findings**  In this cohort study of 469‚ÄØ789 UK Biobank participants, 0.1% were found to be carriers of likely pathogenic or pathogenic _TTR_ variants, which is higher than previously reported. Despite clinical codes suggesting low disease penetrance, cardiac expression of these genotypes was evident from associations with left ventricular mass, conduction disease, incident heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

**Meaning**  These findings emphasize the need for clinical vigilance in identifying individuals at risk of developing transthyretin amyloidosis and associated poor outcomes.

Abstract

**Importance**  The population prevalence of cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) caused by pathogenic variation in the _TTR_ gene (vATTR) is unknown.

**Objective**  To estimate the population prevalence of disease-causing _TTR_ variants and evaluate associated phenotypes and outcomes.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  This population-based cohort study analyzed UK Biobank (UKB) participants with whole-exome sequencing, electrocardiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance data. Participants were enrolled from 2006 to 2010, with a median follow-up of 12 (IQR, 11-13) years (cutoff date for the analysis, March 12, 2024). Sixty-two candidate _TTR_ variants were extracted based on rarity (minor allele frequency ‚â§0.0001) and/or previously described associations with amyloidosis if more frequent.

**Exposure**  Carrier status for _TTR_ variants.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  Associations of _TTR_ carrier status with vATTR prevalence and cardiovascular imaging and electrocardiogram traits were explored using descriptive statistics. Associations between _TTR_ carrier status and atrial fibrillation, conduction disease, heart failure, and all-cause mortality were evaluated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Genotypic and diagnostic concordance was examined using _International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision_ codes from the hospital record.

**Results**  The overall cohort included 469‚ÄØ789 UKB participants (mean [SD] age, 56.5 [8.1] years; 54.2% female and 45.8% male). A likely pathogenic/pathogenic (LP/P) _TTR_ variant was detected in 473 (0.1%) participants, with Val142Ile being the most prevalent (367 [77.6%]); 91 individuals (0.02%) were carriers of a variant of unknown significance. The overall prevalence of LP/P variants was 0.02% (105 of 444‚ÄØ243) in participants with European ancestry and 4.3% (321 of 7533) in participants with African ancestry. The LP/P variants were associated with higher left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.66; 95% CI, 1.87-7.44), and Val142Ile was associated with a longer PR interval (Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ18.34; 95% CI, 5.41-31.27). The LP/P carrier status was associated with a higher risk of heart failure (hazard ratio [HR], 2.68; 95% CI, 1.75-4.12) and conduction disease (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.25-2.83). Higher all-cause mortality risk was observed for non-Val142Ile LP/P variants (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.06-3.67). Thirteen participants (2.8%) with LP/P variants had diagnostic codes compatible with cardiac or neurologic amyloidosis. Variants of unknown significance were not associated with outcomes.

**Conclusions and Relevance**  This study found that approximately 1 in 1000 UKB participants were LP/P _TTR_ variant carriers, exceeding previously reported prevalence. The findings emphasize the need for clinical vigilance in identifying individuals at risk of developing vATTR and associated poor outcomes.

=================================================================================

NXP800 was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of ARID1a-deficient ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.

The novel GCN2 kinase activator NXP800 received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1a (ARID1a) ARID1a-deficient ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers, according to a news release from Nuvectis Pharma, Inc.

‚ÄúWe are very pleased to have received this designation from the FDA for NXP800. The prevalence of ovarian cancer, which is comprised of ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers, exceeds the 200,000-patient threshold below which drugs may be eligible to receive orphan drug designation in the United States,‚Äù Ron Bentsur, MBA, chairman and CEO of Nuvectis, stated in the news release.

The oral small-molecule inhibitor targets the HSF1 pathway, and it has shown strong anti-tumor effects in xenograft models of ARID1a-mutated ovarian carcinoma, as well as in other disease models.

Notably, the FDA granted fast track designation to NXP800 for patients with platinum-resistant, ARID1a-mutated ovarian carcinoma in December 2022, which was then followed by the initiation of the phase 1b clinical trial (NCT05226507) of NXP800 in platinum-resistant, ARID1a-mutated ovarian cancers in April 2023.

‚ÄúIn ovarian cancer it has been uncommon to receive this designation for the treatment of a subset of the disease. We therefore believe that this orphan drug designation granted by the FDA for NXP800 for the treatment of a subset of ovarian cancer, specifically for patients with an ARID1a deficiency, provides further validation for NXP800's mechanism of action and the target patient population in our ongoing phase 1b clinical trial in patients with platinum-resistant, ARID1a-mutated ovarian cancer,‚Äù Bentsur added in the news release.

At the 2024 SGO Annual Meeting on Women‚Äôs Cancer, investigators shared an overview of the ongoing study.

The ongoing phase 1b trial is enrolling patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer harboring ARID1A mutations, which is typically a tumor type that is mostly comprised of ovarian clear-cell carcinoma and ovarian endometrioid carcinoma. To be eligible for enrollment, patients must be 18 years of age or older, have measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, have experienced disease progression within 6 months from completion of platinum-based therapy, and must have received between 1 and 5 prior lines of systemic therapy, including at least 1 regimen containing bevacizumab (Avastin). Additionally, all patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and participants with a BRCA mutation must have received prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor.

Patients who did not respond to, or progressed during, or within 4 weeks of the last dose of first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy were excluded. Treatment with radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or an investigational agent within 28 days of the first dose of NXP800 was also not permitted, nor were active brain metastases.

The phase 1b portion of the trial is currently open for enrollment in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

Regarding the phase 1a portion of the study, which was the first-in-human clinical trial of NXP800, as of April 2023, a total of 18 patients have received at least one dose of NXP800, with the longest treatment duration reaching 10 months, and treatment is still ongoing for some participants. The investigation evaluated 2 different dosing schedules of the agent, including once daily (with total daily doses ranging from 50 mg to 150 mg) and twice daily (with total daily doses of 100 mg and 150 mg).

Furthermore, the most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported were vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, decreased appetite, and weight loss.

For the phase 1b study, doses of 50 mg and 75 mg per day were selected and were chosen based on preliminary population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic analyses, which indicated that once-daily oral administration of NXP800 at these levels achieved biologically active exposure while maintaining an acceptable safety and tolerability profile.

‚ÄúWe expect to provide a data update from this study this coming fall,‚Äù Bentsur concluded.",gpt-4o-mini

A study suggests transient elastography and fibrosis-4 index may be effective in predicting hepatocellular carcinoma risk in hepatitis C patients.

A new study found transient elastography and the fibrosis-4 index offer acceptable predictive performance for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with [hepatitis C virus (HCV)](https://www.hcplive.com/clinical/hepatitis-c) who have achieved a sustained viral response (SVR). 

‚ÄúThese findings highlight the substantial role of non-invasive surrogates in identifying patients at increased risk of HCC development after SVR, emphasizing their utility in clinical practice for guiding surveillance strategies after SVR,‚Äù wrote investigators, led by Han Ah Lee, from the department of internal medicine at Chung-Ang University Hospital, in Korea.

Even after achieving a sustained viral response following antiviral therapy for HCV, individuals with advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis may still develop hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, 8.2 ‚Äì 12.0% of people in South Korea and 34% of people in the US who have HCV develop liver cancer. To assess the predictive performance of transient elastography and the fibrosis-4 index in forecasting HCC development after SVR, investigators conducted a meta-analysis.

The investigators searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, selecting 27 studies for inclusion. Among these, 9 studies focused on transient elastography, 15 on the fibrosis-4 index, and 3 evaluated both methods.

Of the included studies, 11 were single-center, and 16 were multicenter. Most studies originated from Asia (n = 17), with the remaining from non-Asian regions (n = 10).

In total, the meta-analysis examined 169,911 participants with HCV who achieved SVR following antiviral therapy. The mean age of the participants was 54.1 years. The mean liver stiffness measured with transient elastography was 7.1 kPa and with fibrosis-4 index it was 1.86.

Investigators evaluated the predictive performances of transient elastography and fibrosis 4-index using the area under the curve (AUC). Before treatment, the pooled predictive AUC of transient elastography was 0.73, with a sensitivity of 65.7% and specificity of 69.5%.

The pooled risk ratio of pre-treatment transient elastography for HCC development after SVR was 3.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.21 ‚Äì 18.16). However, with a cut-off of 9.2 ‚Äì 13 kPa, the predictive performance improved, showing a pooled AUC of 0.79, sensitivity of 75.1%, and specificity of 71.7%. The pooled risk ratio at this cutoff was 4.56 (95% CI, 3.05‚Äì6.81).

For the fibrosis 4-index, the pre-treatment pooled predictive AUC was 0.72, with a sensitivity of 73.4% and a specificity of 60.5%. It has a pooled risk ratio of 2.30 (95% CI: 1.64‚Äì3.10) for hepatocellular carcinoma development after sustained viral response. With a cut-off of 3.35, the pooled predictive AUC was 0.73 and the pooled risk ratio was 2.45 (95% CI, 1.68 ‚Äì 3.13).

The team identified optimal cut-off values for predicting HCC after SVR: 12.6 kPa for transient elastography measured before treatment and 11.2 kPa for transient elastography measured after SVR.

‚ÄúThe identification of optimal cut-off values for TE and FIB-4 enhances the precision of risk stratification, enabling clinicians to tailor surveillance and management strategies more effectively,‚Äù investigators wrote. ‚ÄúThe study findings support the use of simple, specific cut-off values, thereby enhancing the clinical utility of TE and FIB-4 in HCC surveillance after achieving SVR.‚Äù

Investigators added that using cut-off values improves patient care and enhances the healthcare system more efficiently by focusing on patients most at risk.

Despite these findings, investigators said the results were limited by the reliance of retrospective studies, which introduces bias and limits causal inference, and significant heterogeneity in study design and patient characteristics, affecting the generalizability of findings. Additionally, the lack of standardized cut-off values and variability in follow-up duration complicate the applicability of the results, with further prospective studies needed to refine risk stratification and validate findings.

‚Äú‚Ä¶this systematic review and meta-analysis reinforces the importance of TE and FIB-4 in predicting the risk of HCC development after SVR in patients with HCV,‚Äù investigators wrote. ‚ÄúThese tools can guide the implementation of targeted surveillance strategies by identifying patients at an increased risk of HCC after SVR, ultimately facilitating the early detection and management of HCC. Future research for prospective validation of optimal cut-off values and the integration of non-invasive surrogates into clinical practice guidelines for HCC surveillance in patients with HCV who achieved SVR are needed.‚Äù

#AcuteKidneyInjury #DementiaRisk #Neuroscience #AgingPopulation #HealthcareResearch #PublicHealth #ClinicalPractice","Skyline Therapeutics' Novel Gene Therapy SKG1108 Receives FDA Orphan Drug Designation for Retinitis Pigmentosa
==============================================================================================================

BOSTON and SHANGHAI, Sept. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Skyline Therapeutics, an innovation-driven gene therapy company committed to developing unique and novel solutions for rare and severe diseases, announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for SKG1108, a novel one-time intravitreally delivered gene therapy for the treatment of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). This designation reflects the recognition by the FDA of the potential of SKG1108 for treating RP. The ODD grants special status to SKG1108 and qualifies it for various benefits, which will greatly accelerate the development of the drug and enhance patient access to the leading-edge therapeutic solution.

SKG1108 is a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector with innovative design, utilizing the novel intravitreal capsid AAV.0106 to deliver single-stranded DNA encoding light-activatable proteins directly to the retina. The protein, regulated by specific genetic elements, aims to improve or restore visual function by generating new photo-sensing cells, thereby compensating for the loss of rod and cone photoreceptors in patients with late-stage RP, agnostic on the specific gene or genetic mutation responsible for the condition.

RP is a type of inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) linked to mutations in over 100 different genes or loci, all leading to progressive vision loss. While the age of onset is varied, most RP patients are classified as legally blind by their 40s. The disease typically begins with the degeneration of rod cells, followed by the gradual loss of cone cells, and ultimately leads to the near-complete loss of all photoreceptor cells, leaving the retina non-functional and resulting in blindness. Currently, there are no effective treatments worldwide that can halt or reverse photoreceptor degeneration. Existing therapies targeting specific mutant genes apply only to a small subset of RP patients. SKG1108, an innovative gene therapy that employs a novel approach to improve or restore patients' visual perception and acuity independent of the underlying genetic defects, holds great potential to benefit a broader range of RP patients.

**About Orphan Drug Designation (ODD)**  
Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) is a status granted by the FDA to drugs or biological products that show promise in treating, preventing, or diagnosing rare diseases. The goal of granting ODD is to encourage innovation and research in the development of treatments for rare diseases and to make these treatments available more quickly. ODD qualifies drug sponsors for incentives including tax credits for qualified clinical trials, exemption from the prescription drug user fees, and potential seven years of market exclusivity after approval.

#AcuteKidneyInjury #DementiaRisk #Neuroscience #AgingPopulation #HealthcareResearch #PublicHealth #ClinicalPractice","Providers should assess HbA1c and CGM metrics in diabetes management
====================================================================

By Michael Monostra

Fact checked by Richard Smith

Key takeaways:

- Time in range, time below range and glucose management indicator are three CGM metrics with limitations.
- Providers should consider HbA1c and CGM metrics while caring for a person with diabetes.

Both HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring metrics have limitations, and providers should not rely on a single metric for managing a patient‚Äôs diabetes, according to two speakers.

During a presentation at the Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists annual meeting, Viral N. Shah, MD, professor of medicine in the division of endocrinology and metabolism at Indiana University, and J. Daniel Ruck, DNP, BC-ADM, CDCES, doctor of nursing practice at Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, discussed how no single metric to assess glycemic control in diabetes is perfect. They recommended providers examine all data points they have for a patient and to consider each individual‚Äôs situation when managing diabetes.

‚ÄúWe are treating an individual with diabetes and not the numbers,‚Äù Shah told Healio. ‚ÄúHence, all different numbers, HbA1c and CGM metrics, should be taken together in account considering person-centric views and goals.‚Äù

Publication of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in 1993 established HbA1c as the gold standard for assessing risk for diabetes complications, according to Ruck. HbA1c has value in research, but Ruck said it is less useful for day-to-day diabetes management.

‚ÄúWhen we talk about on the ground what we can do tomorrow [for diabetes management], HbA1c is not as powerful,‚Äù Ruck said during the presentation. ‚ÄúMany factors can influence HbA1c measurements. If you have got a rare blood disease, that can affect it.‚Äù

Additionally, HbA1c does not provide information on hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia or the overall glucose profile of a person with diabetes, according to Ruck.

Time in range limitations

CGM can provide more data an HbA1c measurement, but Shah noted that CGM data also have limitations. In a paper published in Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology in 2013, time in range was established as a glucose between 70 mg/dL and 180 mg/dL. Shah said 180 mg/dL was defined as the upper limit of time in range at the time because it was the postprandial glucose goal for most people with diabetes and there were no effective therapies to keep glucose within a target range of 70 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL.

‚ÄúWe define prediabetes by glucose on an oral glucose tolerance test of more than 140 mg/dL,‚Äù Shah said during the presentation. ‚ÄúSo 140 mg/dL has been accepted because it does increase the risk for cardiovascular disease independent of progression to diabetes. That limit of 140 mg/dL makes more sense to define the time in range, which now we are going to call time in right range.‚Äù

Shah said a time in range of 70 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL is a more physiological target for people with an HbA1c of less than 6.5%, those with prediabetes and people with type 2 diabetes using a GLP-1 receptor agonist or other noninsulin therapy. Ruck said providers should set time in range goals based on each individual‚Äôs situation.

‚ÄúHow safely we can target specific goals should be considered,‚Äù Ruck told Healio. ‚ÄúThe enemy of tight blood sugar control has always been low blood sugar, and if we can get people into tighter range without increasing their low blood sugar risk, then I see this as a good goal to pursue.‚Äù

Hypoglycemia, GMI limitations

Limitations also exist with time in hypoglycemia, or time below range. Time below range was defined as 70 mg/dL based on a 2005 report from an American Diabetes Association working group and was later accepted as the hypoglycemia cutoff by the FDA for artificial pancreas studies. Shah said the ADA working group decision was based off of hypoglycemic clamp studies done among people without diabetes and those with type 1 diabetes and generally did not include those with higher HbA1c measurements.

In 2016, a joint position statement from the ADA and European Association for the Study of Diabetes revised the hypoglycemia cutoffs. The paper defined level 1 hypoglycemia as a ‚Äúglucose alert value‚Äù of 70 mg/dL or less. Level 2 hypoglycemia was considered glucose of 54 mg/dL or less as detected by self-monitoring of plasma glucose, laboratory measurement of plasma glucose or CGM. Level 3 hypoglycemia was defined as severe hypoglycemia with severe cognitive impairment and requiring external assistance for recovery.

‚ÄúThe current limitation of time below range is that it is expressed as a percentage instead of events, and events are more meaningful to patients as well as payers,‚Äù Shah told Healio. ‚ÄúAlso, level 1 time below range may not be very relevant for people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin or sulfonylurea.‚Äù

Shah also discussed limitations with glucose management indicator (GMI), which is an estimated HbA1c based on CGM data. It is calculated using a formula that was developed from data in the REPLACE-BG, DIAMOND-T1D and DIAMOND-T2D clinical trials. Shah said the mean HbA1c of the population was 7.3%, meaning GMI may overestimate HbA1c in people with an HbA1c of less than 6.5%, and underestimate the figure in people with an HbA1c more than 10%.

‚ÄúGMI is a mathematic estimation of HbA1c, while HbA1c is physiological glycation and hence GMI is not necessarily equal to HbA1c for all people with diabetes,‚Äù Shah told Healio.

Shah said the limitations of HbA1c and CGM metrics mean providers need to individualize care and take all data into account when managing a person‚Äôs diabetes.

==========================================================================================

Key takeaways:
--------------

*   Studies on the beta-blocker bisoprolol and dupilumab presented at the ATS Conference gained attention from clinicians on X.
*   Ensifentrine/Ohtuvayre was also discussed on X because of its FDA approval.

In the first half of 2024, many posts on X, formerly Twitter, from U.S. health care professionals discussing COPD treatments focused on beta-blockers, dupilumab and ensifentrine, according to a tracker from Creation Healthcare.

In an analysis spanning January to June 2024, Creation Healthcare evaluated 1,493 COPD-related posts on X, to find out major topics discussed by U.S. health care professionals (HCPs) on this platform.

These COPD-related posts came from a total of 750 HCPs, according to the release.

As Healio previously reported, one of the topics captured by researchers was discussion on COPD therapy types.

Another main topic that was tracked in this analysis was COPD treatments, and much of the online conversation about these treatments took place during the American Thoracic Society International Conference.

‚ÄúDuring the week of the ATS 2024 Conference, the volume of HCP posts was 269% higher than usual,‚Äù Jamie Doggett, associate director of research at Creation Healthcare, told Healio.

Two specific studies presented at the conference gained attention from HCPs on X. The first one was simultaneously published in JAMA and found that treatment with beta-blocker bisoprolol yielded a similar yearly rate of COPD exacerbations that require oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics to placebo.

An additional outcome of this study was that both the bisoprolol group and the placebo group had around 14% of patients who experienced serious adverse events.

The finding that the beta-blocker did not raise the rate of serious adverse events was the takeaway highlighted by Michal Pazdernik, MD, PhD, FESC, deputy director for education in the cardiology department at IKEM Prague, when he posted about the study on May 21. As of Aug. 1, the post had 47 reposts and 133 likes.

Another popular post stating that use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD is OK came from Josh Farkas, MD, assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Vermont, on April 15. In the post, he also asks politely to ‚Äústop propagating the myth that you can‚Äôt use beta-blockers in COPD patients.‚Äù As of Aug. 1, the post had 51 reposts, 288 likes and 58 bookmarks.

The second study presented at ATS that sparked discussion among HCPs on X was the NOTUS trial. With dupilumab (Dupixent; Regeneron, Sanofi) vs. placebo, adults with moderate to severe COPD and type 2 inflammation experienced fewer exacerbations and had better lung function at week 52. Notably, this study was simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

‚ÄúOverall, there were 20 individual HCP mentions of the NOTUS trial,‚Äù Doggett told Healio.

Prior to the ATS conference, MeiLan K. Han, MD, MS, professor of medicine and chief of pulmonology and critical care medicine at the University of Michigan, mentioned dupilumab in a post on March 22, which was around a month after the FDA granted priority review to the drug for COPD with type 2 inflammation.

One additional COPD treatment that gained attention on X was ensifentrine (Ohtuvayre; Verona Pharma) because the FDA approved the phosphodiesterase enzyme 3 and 4 inhibitor for treating adults with COPD in late June.

This announcement was posted on the official Verona Pharma account and had 17 reposts and 37 likes as of Aug. 1. The release from Creation Healthcare noted that excitement from HCPs over this news was seen on X.

#AcuteKidneyInjury #DementiaRisk #Neuroscience #AgingPopulation #HealthcareResearch #PublicHealth #ClinicalPractice","Major trial to test multiple drugs for progressive supranuclear palsy
=====================================================================

A clinical trial that will test three drugs concurrently, and could include more, represents new hope for patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that usually kills within seven years after symptoms start.

Researchers hope the trial, which will be led by UC San Francisco and conducted at up to 50 sites nationwide, will lead to the development of new therapies. There are currently no drugs to stall the disease's deadly progression.

The trial is made possible by a five-year grant of up to $75.4 million from the National Institute on Aging (NIA), which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It is among the largest grants that UCSF has received in recent years for a neurodegenerative disorder.

> The hope is that the study will transform the type of care that patients with PSP receive. If none of the first three drugs are effective, we will continue trying with other drugs. Even if we slow the progression of the disease by 20%, 30%, that's a meaningful impact on a condition with relentless progression and no cure.""  
> ‚Äî Julio Rojas, MD, PhD, of the UCSF Department of Neurology, Memory and Aging Center and the Weill Institute for Neurosciences, and a principal investigator of the trial

PSP is believed to be triggered by a buildup of tau protein that causes brain cells to weaken and die. It is frequently mistaken for Parkinson's disease. Both conditions are movement disorders, but PSP is far less common, affecting approximately 30,000 Americans, most of whom are in their fifties to seventies.

Richardson's syndrome is the most common form of PSP. In addition to cognitive difficulties, symptoms include slowness, stiffness, falling backward and difficulty with eye movement, especially looking down.

An innovative study design
--------------------------

The three drugs will be tested using a platform clinical trial model similar to one used for a study of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder that is much better known and better funded than PSP, although they both affect similar numbers of people. The trial is designed to reduce the time it takes to find effective therapies, decrease the number of participants on placebo and discontinue therapies as soon as they have demonstrated they are ineffective.

""Unlike typical clinical trials, platform trials can remain open with multiple new therapies tested in successive cycles if the first ones don't work,"" said Adam Boxer, MD, PhD, endowed professor in memory and aging at the UCSF Department of Neurology, as well as a principal investigator in the trial. ""This means there are more opportunities to identify effective treatments in a faster timeframe, with lower cost and less burden to participants. Patients on the PSP trial will have a 75% chance of treatment with an active drug and after one year, all participants will have the opportunity to receive a drug.""

In addition, data, imaging and biospecimens from the trial will be shared with PSP researchers worldwide, Boxer noted.

Enrollment of diverse populations a high priority
-------------------------------------------------

The study will focus on enrolling participants who are underrepresented in clinical trials.

""We will build on experience from other community engaged research programs and develop relationships with Spanish-speaking communities,"" Rojas said. ""These participants would be served by Spanish-speaking clinicians, including a neuropsychologist conducting assessments in Spanish. Similar efforts will be made in the African American and other medically underserved communities.""

Practical and financial barriers may be eliminated by covering transportation and hotel costs, he added.

The nonprofit organization CurePSP will be collaborating with UCSF and other trial sites to recruit participants. According to Kristophe Diaz, PhD, the organization's executive director and chief science officer, the trial ""marks a pivotal step forward"" in bringing renewed hope to patients and families.

""Families ask us how they can fight back, but often the most we can offer is guidance on building a support network and assembling a care team,"" he said. ""This platform is a beacon of hope, bringing us closer to effective treatments and ultimately a cure.""

Enrollment is expected to start in fall 2025. It will be open to patients with Richardson's syndrome, which affects about 70% of patients with PSP. These patients must have had progressive symptoms for fewer than five years and be accompanied by a care partner.",gpt-4o-mini

#AcuteKidneyInjury #DementiaRisk #Neuroscience #AgingPopulation #HealthcareResearch #PublicHealth #ClinicalPractice","Meat consumption and incident type 2 diabetes: an individual-participant federated meta-analysis of 1¬∑97 million adults with 100‚Äà000 incident cases from 31 cohorts in 20 countries

### Summary

#### Background

Meat consumption could increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, evidence is largely based on studies of European and North American populations, with heterogeneous analysis strategies and a greater focus on red meat than on poultry. We aimed to investigate the associations of unprocessed red meat, processed meat, and poultry consumption with type 2 diabetes using data from worldwide cohorts and harmonised analytical approaches.

#### Methods

This individual-participant federated meta-analysis involved data from 31 cohorts participating in the InterConnect project. Cohorts were from the region of the Americas (n=12) and the Eastern Mediterranean (n=2), European (n=9), South-East Asia (n=1), and Western Pacific (n=7) regions. Access to individual-participant data was provided by each cohort; participants were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 18 years or older and had available data on dietary consumption and incident type 2 diabetes and were excluded if they had a diagnosis of any type of diabetes at baseline or missing data. Cohort-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated for each meat type, adjusted for potential confounders (including BMI), and pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis, with meta-regression to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity.

#### Findings

Among 1‚Äà966‚Äà444 adults eligible for participation, 107‚Äà271 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified during a median follow-up of 10 (IQR 7‚Äì15) years. Median meat consumption across cohorts was 0‚Äì110 g/day for unprocessed red meat, 0‚Äì49 g/day for processed meat, and 0‚Äì72 g/day for poultry. Greater consumption of each of the three types of meat was associated with increased incidence of type 2 diabetes, with HRs of 1¬∑10 (95% CI 1¬∑06‚Äì1¬∑15) per 100 g/day of unprocessed red meat (_I_2=61%), 1¬∑15 (1¬∑11‚Äì1¬∑20) per 50 g/day of processed meat (_I_2=59%), and 1¬∑08 (1¬∑02‚Äì1¬∑14) per 100 g/day of poultry (_I_2=68%). Positive associations between meat consumption and type 2 diabetes were observed in North America and in the European and Western Pacific regions; the CIs were wide in other regions. We found no evidence that the heterogeneity was explained by age, sex, or BMI. The findings for poultry consumption were weaker under alternative modelling assumptions. Replacing processed meat with unprocessed red meat or poultry was associated with a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes.

#### Interpretation

The consumption of meat, particularly processed meat and unprocessed red meat, is a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes across populations. These findings highlight the importance of reducing meat consumption for public health and should inform dietary guidelines.

#### Funding

The EU, the Medical Research Council, and the National Institute of Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.

### Introduction

Global meat production has increased rapidly over the past 50 years. Dietary meat consumption surpasses optimal dietary guidelines in many regions, and is correlated with an elevated burden of non-communicable diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes affects more than 500 million people worldwide and is estimated to affect 1 billion people by 2050. Evidence from several meta-analyses of published prospective studies shows a positive association between intakes of unprocessed red meat and processed meat and the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, some reviews have drawn contradictory conclusions on the certainty of evidence in this field.

Poultry has often been considered a potentially healthier alternative to red and processed meat; however, the association between poultry consumption and type 2 diabetes risk has been characterised in only a few studies, with inconclusive results. Moreover, published associations between meat consumption and the incidence of type 2 diabetes have been heterogeneous, probably because of variations in research methods and population-specific characteristics.

### Research in context

**Evidence before this study**

We searched PubMed for articles published between Jan 1, 1970, and Dec 1, 2023, using the terms ‚Äúmeat‚Äù OR ‚Äúpoultry‚Äù OR ‚Äúchicken‚Äù AND ‚Äúdiabetes‚Äù, with no language restrictions; this search returned 2583 results. 21 individual cohort studies and nine meta-analysis studies that evaluated associations between meat consumption and type 2 diabetes in populations were considered. All the existing meta-analyses were conducted on the basis of published summary data and the included studies were primarily from high-income countries, mainly within Europe and North America.

**Added value of this study**

Our prospective study of almost 1¬∑97 million participants‚Äîwith more than 100‚Äà000 incident cases during follow-up‚Äîexamined associations of the consumption of unprocessed red meat, processed meat, and poultry with incident type 2 diabetes across global populations, in a federated meta-analysis of individual-participant data. This study included 31 cohorts from 20 countries, which‚Äîto our knowledge‚Äîexceeds the scale of any previous research on this topic.

**Implications of all the available evidence**

Our federated meta-analysis supports dietary recommendations to limit the consumption of processed meat and unprocessed red meat to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Evidence regarding the effect of poultry consumption is less consistent, highlighting the need for further research.

### Methods

#### Study design and participants

This federated meta-analysis used data from cohorts participating in the InterConnect project. Cohorts eligible for the current study contained participants aged 18 years or older with available data for dietary consumption and incident type 2 diabetes. For each cohort, we excluded participants with a diagnosis of prevalent diabetes of any type at analytical baseline, those with implausible energy intakes, or those with missing values for any of the exposures, outcomes, or potential confounders. We attempted to contact 115 eligible cohorts, of which 31 from 20 countries agreed to participate in this study.

#### Consumption of meat and other food groups

Dietary information in the participating cohorts was collected by self-reported approaches. Total energy intake was calculated using cohort-specific or region-specific serving-size estimates and food composition information.

#### Ascertainment of incident type 2 diabetes

We used two different definitions of type 2 diabetes, one as the primary outcome and one as the secondary outcome. 

#### Covariates

We considered the following covariates as potential confounding factors: sociodemographic characteristics, health and lifestyle behaviours, dietary information, BMI, comorbidities at baseline, and family history of any type of diabetes.

#### Statistical analysis

For the ten cohorts setting up a server for federated analysis, cohort-specific analyses were conducted using DataSHIELD. We pooled estimated effects across all cohorts and by global region using a random-effects meta-analysis. 

### Results

This federated meta-analysis included data from 1‚Äà966‚Äà444 individuals from 31 cohorts participating in the InterConnect project. Among these cohorts, 18 had not previously published findings on this research topic. 

Meat consumption varied by population. Over a median follow-up of 10 (IQR 7‚Äì15) years, 107‚Äà271 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified according to the primary definition. The consumption of unprocessed red meat was positively associated with incident type 2 diabetes in the most adjusted model, with an HR per 100 g/day intake of 1¬∑10 (95% CI 1¬∑06‚Äì1¬∑15). Associations were also seen for processed meat consumption, with an HR per 50 g/day intake of 1¬∑15 (1¬∑11‚Äì1¬∑20), and poultry consumption, with an HR per 100 g/day of 1¬∑08 (1¬∑02‚Äì1¬∑14).

### Discussion

The InterConnect project enabled an extensive evaluation of associations between meat consumption and type 2 diabetes using an individual-participant federated meta-analysis. Our findings show that the consumption of unprocessed red meat, processed meat, and poultry were each associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

- A cohort of 298,553 adults in Sweden and Denmark was evaluated, comparing GLP-1 receptor agonists with SGLT2 inhibitors.
- Only 77 suicide deaths occurred among GLP-1 users, indicating a low incidence rate (0.23 per 1000 person-years) compared to 71 deaths in the SGLT2 group (0.18 per 1000 person-years).
- The hazard ratio for suicides was 1.25, but confidence intervals suggest no significant increased risk.
- Interestingly, the study found a lower risk of nonfatal self-harm associated with GLP-1 use (HR 0.83).
- No substantial association with incident depression and anxiety-related disorders was observed (HR 1.01).
- The overall findings offer reassurance about the safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists in routine clinical practice, especially for patients with type 2 diabetes.
- It's crucial to keep monitoring and discussing potential risk factors as further studies may refine our understanding of these associations.

üîç Recent findings highlight a critical link between acute kidney injury (AKI) and dementia risk:

- AKI history doubles the risk of developing dementia, drawing attention to the need for early monitoring.
- This study followed over 305,000 individuals aged 65+ in Stockholm, uncovering 47,938 cases of dementia over 12 years.
- Notably, AKI increased the occurrence of Lewy body dementia (DLB) by 88%, vascular dementia by 47%, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) by 31%.
- Severe AKI linked to hospitalization poses a 61% higher risk than less severe cases.
- A dose-response relationship exists between the severity of AKI and dementia risk, reinforcing the need for comprehensive prevention strategies.
- Age stratification revealed a staggering FOUR-FOLD INCREASE IN DLB AND PDD RISK for those over 85 years.
These insights emphasize the importance of monitoring kidney function as part of dementia prevention strategies. Let's discuss how this can be integrated into clinical practice!

Key Points

**Question** What is the association between use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and risk of suicide death in patients treated in routine clinical practice?

**Findings** In this cohort study of 298‚ÄØ553 adults initiating a GLP-1 receptor agonist or a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor nationwide in Sweden and Denmark, the incidence rate of suicide death was low, and those initiating GLP-1 receptor agonist use did not experience increased risk.

**Meaning** This study provides reassuring data showing that those initiating GLP-1 receptor agonist use were not at increased risk of suicide death, although the study could not assess small risk increases.

**Importance** Concerns have been raised regarding a link between use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and increased risk of suicidality and self-harm.

**Objective** To assess the association between use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and the risk of suicide death in routine clinical practice.

**Design, Setting, and Participants** This active-comparator new-user cohort study used nationwide register data from Sweden and Denmark from 2013 to 2021. Adults 18 to 84 years old who initiated treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists or the comparator sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were included. Data were analyzed from March to June 2024.

**Exposure** Initiation of treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor.

**Main Outcomes and Measures** The primary outcome was suicide death recorded in the cause of death registers. Secondary outcomes were the composite of suicide death and nonfatal self-harm and the composite of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. Using propensity score weighting, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated separately in the 2 countries and pooled in a meta-analysis.

**Results** In total, 124‚ÄØ517 adults initiated a GLP-1 receptor agonist and 174‚ÄØ036 initiated an SGLT2 inhibitor; among GLP-1 receptor agonist users, the mean (SD) age was 60 (13) years, and 45% were women. During a mean (SD) follow-up of 2.5 (1.7) years, 77 suicide deaths occurred among users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 71 suicide deaths occurred among users of SGLT2 inhibitors: weighted incidences were 0.23 vs 0.18 events per 1000 person-years (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.83-1.88), with an absolute difference of 0.05 (95% CI, ‚àí0.03 to 0.16) events per 1000 person-years. The HR was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.97) for suicide death and nonfatal self-harm, and the HR was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.97-1.06) for incident depression and anxiety-related disorders.

**Conclusions and Relevance** This cohort study, including mostly patients with type 2 diabetes, does not show an association between use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and an increased risk of suicide death, self-harm, or incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. Suicide death among GLP-1 receptor agonist users was rare, and the upper limit of the confidence interval was compatible with an absolute risk increase of no more than 0.16 events per 1000 person-years.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are increasingly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Concerns have been raised regarding suicidality and self-harm linked to use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. In July 2023, the European Medicines Agency launched an investigation into the safety signal following around 150 spontaneous reports received by the agency regarding suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm potentially associated with the drug. An effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on suicidality is plausible, as GLP-1 receptors are present in the central nervous system and GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. Previous studies have linked bariatric surgery and weight-reduction drugs to a potentially increased risk of suicide and self-harm. Conversely, it has also been suggested that GLP-1 receptor agonists may protect against depression. This hypothesis is based on studies indicating that depression and type 2 diabetes may have partly overlapping causes, including neuroinflammation, and that GLP-1 receptor agonists show neuroprotective properties.

We conducted a cohort study using nationwide data from Sweden and Denmark to examine the association of GLP-1 receptor agonist use with suicide death. In secondary analyses, we assessed the association of GLP-1 receptor agonist use with the composite of suicide and nonfatal self-harm, as well as the composite of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders.

We used health and administrative registers in Sweden and Denmark, including the population registers, prescription drug registers, national patient registers, and cause of death registers, all with nationwide coverage in each country. The registers provide data on demographic variables and vital status, all filled prescriptions from all pharmacies in each country, diagnoses and procedures registered during all outpatient specialist care visits and hospitalizations, and causes of death. Sweden and Denmark have similar universal health care systems and register infrastructure. Using the same study protocol, we conducted the analyses in Sweden and Denmark separately and performed a meta-analysis of the 2 country-specific estimates.

The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. Informed consent was not needed. Ethical approval is not required for register-based research in Denmark. The study is reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines for cohort studies.

Using an active-comparator new-user design, we included all new users of either GLP-1 receptor agonists or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (comparator) who were 18 to 84 years old during 2013 to 2021. Patients entered the cohort at the time of their first filled prescription for either a GLP-1 receptor agonist or an SGLT2 inhibitor during the study period. SGLT2 inhibitors were used as the comparator because this drug has no known association with suicide death and was used in similar clinical situations (predominantly as second-line or third-line glucose-lowering drugs for treatment of type 2 diabetes) during the study period, with both GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors being recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Both drugs were primarily used for type 2 diabetes during the study period.

New use was defined as initiation of either drug among patients with no previous use of either drug at any time prior to cohort entry. Exclusion criteria were end-stage illness (severe malnutrition, cachexia, dementia, coma), history of dialysis, kidney transplant, major pancreatic disease, use of preparation of liraglutide with obesity indication before cohort entry (the comparator, SGLT2 inhibitors, are not used for this indication; liraglutide with obesity indication was defined using specific product codes), and no health care contact in the past year (to ensure a minimum level of health care contact and registration of health data), defined as neither outpatient care contact, hospital admission, nor use of any prescription drug.

The primary outcome was suicide death (primary or contributing cause of death), including both confirmed suicides and self-inflicted deaths of undetermined intent. Secondary outcomes were a composite of suicide death and nonfatal self-harm recorded as a physician-assigned diagnosis during hospitalizations or outpatient hospital visits. Self-harm was also analyzed as a separate outcome. Although nonfatal self-harm is known to be underreported in Denmark, we used this outcome also in Denmark because underreporting was unlikely to differ between the study drugs, thus allowing for calculation of relative risk estimates. For the analyses of outcomes including self-harm, we excluded patients with self-harm within 3 months prior to cohort entry.

Another secondary outcome was a composite of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders, recorded as diagnoses during hospitalizations or outpatient visits, or filled prescriptions for antidepressants. For this analysis, we further excluded patients with previous psychiatric disorders, defined as any psychiatric disease diagnosis or use of psychiatric medications at any time prior to cohort entry.

Patients were considered as exposed to the drug that they initiated at cohort entry until end of follow-up and were followed to outcome event, emigration, 5 years of follow-up, or end of study period (December 31, 2021). In each country separately, we estimated a propensity score for the probability of GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment conditional on variables at cohort entry, covering sociodemographic characteristics, calendar year of cohort entry, and medical history, including psychiatric diagnoses, recent health care contacts for psychiatric conditions, and prescription drug use. We controlled for confounding using the propensity score and standardized mortality ratio weighting to estimate the average treatment effect among the treated, as this can directly inform clinical decision-making. After exclusion of patients outside of the common range of the propensity score for the 2 groups, and those at the 1% tails of the distribution of the common range (trimming), the propensity score was reestimated, and those outside of the common range of the new propensity score were excluded. Reestimation of the propensity score after trimming is important because the model derived from the untrimmed population is mis-specified in the population that remains after trimming. Standardized differences below 10% after weighting were considered as good balance between exposure groups. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox regression, with days since cohort entry as the time scale. We performed a meta-analysis of the country-specific estimates, with a fixed-effect model using the method of Mantel and Haenszel. The absolute risk difference for the primary outcome was calculated as HR‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ1 multiplied by the rate in the comparator group.

We performed a subgroup analysis for the primary outcome by history of psychiatric disorders, as the investigated safety signal is of most importance for treatment decisions among those at high risk. We also performed subgroup analyses for those who initiated liraglutide and semaglutide, respectively. Propensity scores were reestimated for each secondary outcome and subgroup analysis.

We performed additional analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes. We applied an as-treated exposure definition, in which patients were censored at switch-to or add-on treatment with the other study drug or treatment discontinuation. Treatment duration was estimated based on the number of days covered by the filled prescriptions plus a 90-day period between prescriptions and after the last prescription. Furthermore, we restricted the follow-up to 1 year to assess whether a possible risk increase emerges shortly after treatment initiation.

Due to remaining imbalance in 1 baseline variable after weighting in Denmark (no use of other glucose-lowering drugs in the past 6 months), we adjusted for this variable in Denmark in post hoc sensitivity analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes. As the secondary outcome of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders included use of antidepressants, which can be prescribed also for other conditions, we performed a sensitivity analysis defining the outcome using only diagnoses registered during health care visits.

As the primary outcome analysis showed no statistically significant association, we calculated the E-value representing the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment and suicide death (conditional on the covariates included in the propensity score) to shift the confidence interval toward an increased risk such that it excludes the null. Confidence intervals not including 1.0 were considered as showing a statistically significant risk difference. Data were analyzed from March to June 2024, and analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

Population Characteristics

In total, 124‚ÄØ517 users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 174‚ÄØ036 users of SGLT2 inhibitors were included. Among GLP-1 receptor agonist users, the mean (SD) age was 60 (13) years and 45% were women. The most commonly used GLP-1 receptor agonists were liraglutide (50%) and semaglutide (41%). Patient characteristics before and after weighting for Sweden and Denmark separately are summarized in the tables. The propensity score distributions are shown in the figures. Patient characteristics were well balanced after weighting, except for the proportion of patients in Denmark with no use of other glucose-lowering drugs in the past 6 months. The median (IQR) follow-up time in the primary outcome analysis was 2.8 (1.2-4.8) years for GLP-1 receptor agonist users and 2.1 (0.8-3.6) years for SGLT2 inhibitor users in Sweden, and 2.1 (0.8-4.7) years for GLP-1 receptor agonist users and 2.2 (0.8-3.9) years for SGLT2 inhibitor users in Denmark. Combining the 2 countries, mean (SD) follow-up was 2.5 (1.7) years: 2.7 (2.3) years for GLP-1 receptor agonists and 2.3 (1.6) years for SGLT2 inhibitors.

During follow-up, 77 GLP-1 receptor agonist users and 71 SGLT2 inhibitor users died by suicide. The weighted incidence rate was 0.23 vs 0.18 events per 1000 person-years (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.83-1.88), with an absolute difference of 0.05 (95% CI, ‚àí0.03 to 0.16) events per 1000 person-years. The country-specific HR was 1.44 (95% CI, 0.87-2.37) for Sweden and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.46-1.91) for Denmark. In the subgroup analysis, the HR was 1.25 (95% CI, 0.77-2.02) for those with a history of psychiatric disorders and 1.44 (95% CI, 0.71-2.92) for those without such a history. The HR was 1.35 (95% CI, 0.85-2.15) for those initiating liraglutide and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.33-1.67) for those initiating semaglutide.

Secondary Outcome Analyses

After exclusion of those with nonfatal self-harm within 3 months prior to cohort entry, 124‚ÄØ459 users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 173‚ÄØ985 users of SGLT2 inhibitors were included in the analysis of self-harm. The HR was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.97) for the composite outcome of suicide death and nonfatal self-harm and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65-0.91) for self-harm.

After exclusion of those with previous psychiatric disorders, 72‚ÄØ420 users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 111‚ÄØ083 users of SGLT2 inhibitors were included in the analysis of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. The HR was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.97-1.06).

Results for Sweden and Denmark separately are summarized in the tables.

Additional Analyses and Sensitivity Analysis

In the analyses of suicide death, the HR was 1.27 (95% CI, 0.76-2.15) when using the as-treated exposure definition and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.54-2.28) when restricting the follow-up to the first year. The post hoc sensitivity analysis, in which the variable no use of other glucose-lowering drug in the past 6 months was adjusted for, yielded an HR consistent with that of the main analysis in Denmark. The additional analyses for the secondary outcomes and the sensitivity analysis in which the secondary outcome of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders was restricted to diagnoses registered during health care visits are summarized in the tables. The E-value for the primary analysis showed that an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both GLP-1 receptor agonist use and suicide death by a risk ratio of at least 1.7 to shift the confidence interval to exclude the null.

In this cohort study of nationwide data from 2 countries, we found no statistically significant increased risk of suicide death for GLP-1 receptor agonists vs SGLT2 inhibitors used predominantly for type 2 diabetes. The upper limit of the confidence interval was compatible with up to an 88% relative-risk increase of suicide death, which corresponded to an absolute risk increase of no more than 0.16 per 1000 person-years. The findings indicate that the absolute risks of suicide death in broad groups of patients using GLP-1 receptor agonists are low and any potential risk increase would be small. We also found a slightly lower risk of self-harm and no statistically significant association with incident depression and anxiety-related disorders.

The investigated safety concern for GLP-1 receptor agonist use was based on spontaneous reports of suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm. To cover a wider range of conditions and outcomes associated with thoughts of self-harm and suicide, we assessed suicide death, suicide death and nonfatal self-harm, and self-harm and incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. In randomized clinical trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists, increases in suicidality, depression, anxiety, and other adverse mental health outcomes have not been observed. However, many trials excluded those at highest risk of suicidality through exclusion criteria or based on investigators‚Äô judgment such that uncertainty remained regarding the generalizability of the findings to broader patient groups, and the statistical power was low due to few events. For example, a meta-analysis of clinical trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists included only 18 events of suicidal behavior among exposed patients.

A previous study using electronic health records from the TriNetX Analytics Network assessed diagnoses of suicidal ideation during 6 months after treatment initiation with the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide. In separate analyses, the study included 52‚ÄØ783 patients with overweight or obesity and 27‚ÄØ282 patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed semaglutide, then propensity score matched them with users of non‚ÄìGLP-1 receptor agonist antiobesity or glucose-lowering medications. Semaglutide use was associated with very large relative reductions in suicidal ideation diagnosis of around 70% in both sets of analyses, indicating that the study design likely introduced important biases. For example, immortal time bias may have been introduced as a new-user design was not used: patients with semaglutide prescriptions were first included regardless of their comparator drug use history, and the comparator group was selected from the remaining patients prescribed the comparator drug. Moreover, in the analyses of patients with type 2 diabetes, any other glucose-lowering drugs, including those used as first-line therapies, were included as the comparator, although this may have led to time-lag bias through misalignment in disease progression between the groups. Furthermore, suicide death during follow-up could not be accounted for as data on vital status and causes of death were not available.

Strengths and Limitations

This study expands the knowledge regarding the safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists by providing data about the risk of suicide death associated with use of the drugs using an active-comparator new-user design, which avoids time-related biases and aligns patients in the exposed vs control group with respect to disease stage. Moreover, confounders were adjusted for using a propensity score, including a wide range of patient characteristics, and the nationwide registers enabled analysis of national study populations with virtually complete data on cause of death. This study supports the conclusions of the European Medicines Agency‚Äôs investigation and the US Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs preliminary evaluation that the available evidence does not support a causal association between use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and suicidal and self-injurious thoughts and actions.

This study has limitations. We adjusted for potential confounders, including psychiatric disorders and socioeconomic status recorded in the registers, but unmeasured confounding may have affected the results. During the study period, GLP-1 receptor agonists were predominantly used for treatment of type 2 diabetes. The drugs are increasingly used also in patients with obesity who do not have diabetes, and the study findings might not be generalizable to this group of patients. Although it is possible that some patients included in the study used GLP-1 receptor agonists off label for weight reduction, this proportion is likely to be low; a Danish study showed that the proportion of new users of semaglutide with no evidence of a type 2 diabetes diagnosis in the register data was 1% to 5% in 2018 to 2020 and 15% in 2021. Moreover, in the present analyses, liraglutide (50%) and semaglutide (41%) were the most used GLP-1 receptor agonists; the subgroup analyses for each of the 2 GLP-1 receptor agonists had low numbers of events, and associations with suicidality could differ between individual drugs. Furthermore, mean follow-up time for GLP-1 receptor agonist users was 2.7 years, and although 25% of the GLP-1 receptor agonist users were followed for at least 4.7 years, risks may emerge with longer-term use. Although subgroup analyses with low numbers of events should be interpreted with much caution, especially when the subgroup hypothesis was not formulated a priori based on a suggested mechanism, the HR for suicide death in Sweden was 1.44 (95% CI, 0.87-2.37), with this nominal risk difference emerging around 3 years after cohort entry.

Some suicide deaths could also be misclassified. In an assessment of the reliability of the cause of death register from 2008, the proportion of suicide deaths with intent confirmed by experts was 81% in Sweden and 90% in Denmark, with few accidents and natural deaths being reclassified as suicides. We also included self-inflicted deaths of undetermined intent in the primary outcome definition, as an investigation by the National Center for Suicide Research and Prevention in Sweden showed that 20% of suicide cases in the country were coded as of undetermined intent and 70% to 75% of self-inflicted deaths with unknown intent were reclassified as suicide after further investigation. The overall rates of suicide death in the study population were largely in line with national estimates in both Denmark and Sweden. Nonfatal self-harm is known to be underreported in Denmark, and the absolute risks of the secondary outcome analysis, including this outcome, are likely underestimated, as is demonstrated by the substantially lower rates observed in Denmark compared to Sweden. We could also not assess suicidal thoughts and self-harm that did not result in suicide death or a registered diagnosis during contact with the health care system. The low risk of suicide death meant that the study had limited power to assess smaller risk increases.

In this binational cohort study including predominantly patients with type 2 diabetes, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared with SGLT2 inhibitors was not associated with an increased risk of suicide death, self-harm, or incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. While reassuring, the study could not rule out smaller absolute risk differences for suicide death, and future studies with more outcome events should be performed as data accumulate.

Introduction

Cancer survivors face substantial economic hardships during and after oncologic care, compounding the physical and psychosocial implications of a cancer diagnosis and compromising treatment adherence, quality of life, and survival. Financial hardship has been the focus of policy initiatives addressing cost-sharing and insurance coverage to alleviate direct costs to patients. However, the role of community factors and structural barriers in the experience of financial hardship remains unknown. We hypothesized that adverse community-level social determinants of health may exacerbate financial hardship for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. For these reasons, we estimated the prevalence of financial hardship among cancer survivors across cancer types and investigated associations with individual- and community-level characteristics.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed the 2021 Health Information National Trends Survey‚ÄìSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (HINTS-SEER), which is sampled from 3 SEER registries. We included respondents of all ages, cancer types, and disease stages in the HINTS-SEER cohort. The primary outcome was patient-reported experience of cancer-related financial hardship (categorized as not at all, a little, some, or a lot). The primary exposure was the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). Covariates included age, sex, education level, income, insurance status, and SEER cancer stage; individual-level race and ethnicity were omitted because community-level race and ethnicity are factored into the SVI and considered a social construct. Survey-weighted estimates of financial hardship across cancer types and for the entire cohort were calculated. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression for financial hardship was performed adjusting for all independent variables. Odds ratios were calculated for covariates, and average marginal effects were calculated for SVI. Analyses were adjusted for sample weights and complex survey design. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata, version 18 (StataCorp LLC); statistical significance was defined as 2-tailed P < .05.

Because HINTS-SEER data are publicly available, deidentified, and approved by local SEER registries and Westat Institutional Review Boards, this study was exempt from assessment and informed consent by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. We followed the STROBE reporting guideline.

Results

We identified 1212 respondents representing more than 400‚ÄØ000 cancer survivors on weighted analysis. The median (IQR) age was 72 years (65-79 years) and the median (IQR) SVI score was 0.41 (0.27-0.68); 59.1% had completed college, 56.5% had an annual household income greater than $75‚ÄØ000, 70.5% had private or employer-based health insurance, and 67.8% had localized disease. When asked about experience of financial hardship, 56.4%, 22.1%, 15.0%, and 6.5% responded not at all, a little, some, and a lot, respectively, with variation by cancer type. Increasing SVI score (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.80 [95% CI, 1.00-3.21]), younger age (50-59 years; aOR, 3.66 [95% CI, 2.37-5.67]), lower income ($35‚ÄØ000-$74‚ÄØ999; aOR, 3.55 [95% CI, 1.94-6.48]), advanced SEER cancer stage (nonlocal; aOR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.47-2.51]), and federal health insurance (Medicare; aOR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.02-2.00]) were associated with higher odds of increased financial hardship. An increase in SVI of 0.01 conferred a lower probability of reporting no financial hardship and higher probability of reporting a little, some, or a lot of financial hardship (average marginal effects: ‚àí12.37 [95% CI, ‚àí24.58 to ‚àí0.15], 3.49 [95% CI, 0.04-7.02], 5.35 [95% CI, 0.12-10.57], and 3.53 [95% CI, ‚àí0.13-7.20], respectively).

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study, approximately 50% of cancer survivors experienced cancer-related financial hardship, with a disproportionate number of survivors who were younger, were Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries, were socioeconomically disadvantaged, and had advanced disease. Social vulnerability was independently associated with increasing levels of financial hardship, emphasizing the central role one‚Äôs community may play in cancer survivorship and the compounding financial detriments of residing in a socially vulnerable community.

Study limitations include a study design that precluded our ability to establish causality, selection bias and reduced generalizability due to sampling methodology, recall bias due to patient-reported variables, and unobserved confounding. Although policy efforts to curb the costs of cancer care are essential, acknowledging the role of community and structural barriers and identifying socially vulnerable populations for targeted interventions represent a potential strategy toward mitigating financial hardship and delivering equitable cancer care.

_Guidelines_ is Going Digital in 2025
=====================================

**Nina Buchan, Editor of** _**Guidelines**_ **and** _**Guidelines in Practice**_**, Highlights the Benefits of Online Access as** _**Guidelines**_ **Goes Exclusively Digital for 2025**

In 2025, _Guidelines_ will become an exclusively digital publication, giving primary care practitioners easy access to the complete catalogue of more than 250 clinical guideline summaries. The change will help _Guidelines_ to keep pace with the evolving needs of healthcare professionals while responding to challenges such as sustainability. This article highlights the benefits of accessing _Guidelines_ online and through the Medscape App, charting the successes that have made _Guidelines_ the trusted source of information it is today.

### What Will Change When _Guidelines_ Goes Exclusively Digital?

There will be no change in the quality or number of clinical summaries produced; in fact, online, primary care practitioners will have easy access to the whole catalogue of clinical summaries rather than the selection featured in the print handbook. Accessing _Guidelines_ online means that the latest summaries are available wherever and whenever needed.

In addition, online _Guidelines_ summaries feature useful signposts to related resources on the same guidance, such as _Guidelines in Practice_ articles or Primary Care Hacks. Finally, becoming exclusively digital is a more sustainable choice, saving paper, plastic, power, and transport.

### Building on the Successes of the _Guidelines_ Handbook 

For 27 years, the _Guidelines_ print handbook has delivered the latest clinical guideline summaries to GP surgeries around the UK. At its peak, the _Guidelines_ handbook was issued four times a year to an audience of 30,000 GPs, nurses, and clinical pharmacists working in UK primary care, delivering a selection of summaries of new, recently updated, and topical clinical guidance.

The 2022/23 GP Media Survey, which examined the media preferences of 568 GPs, determined that:
- clinical guidelines were the most valuable source of information to GPs
- 93% of GPs had sought clinical guidelines in the preceding 4 weeks.

In 2022, _Guidelines_ conducted a survey of the reading habits of 890 healthcare professionals, and found that:
- 78.3% used _Guidelines_ regularly to access clinical guidelines, second only to NICE
- 90% used _Guidelines_ to keep abreast of guidance updates
- 66% had changed or adapted their clinical practice as a result of reading _Guidelines_.

Since its inception, _Guidelines_ has met the needs of its audience by producing concise, easily navigable summaries of key clinical guidelines, highlighting the recommendations that have changed to help healthcare professionals working in primary care keep pace with guidance updates. Its editors and editorial advisory consultants have collaborated to produce accurate summaries of guidance by over 70 independent professional bodies, generating a catalogue of summaries across 29 clinical areas to support primary care with the implementation of best practice.

Some of the biggest successes in the history of _Guidelines_ include the creation at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic of the _Key COVID-19 guidance hub_‚Äîa one-stop repository of guidance, information, and resources on all aspects of COVID-19 for UK primary care practitioners trying to navigate the rapidly evolving situation. More recently, _Guidelines_ has benefited from working in partnership with NICE, enabling faster publication of summaries of new and updated guidelines.

_Guidelines_ will continue to innovate in 2025 and beyond, to support primary care in the delivery of best-practice care.

TOPLINE:
--------

In a UK survey, participants said they supported the idea of weight screening and offers of weight management at dental appointments.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   A cross-sectional survey of 3463 adults from dental practices and community and hospital settings in England and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Be Part of Research initiative.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Most participants (85%) reported attending a dental checkup in the past 12 months, and 71.2% said they would like to lose weight.
*   Overall, 60% of participants said they would ""yes, definitely/probably"" be comfortable with their height and weight being measured to calculate their body mass index at a dental appointment, whereas 10.3% responded maybe and 28.6% said no.
*   In multivariable analysis, the odds of acceptance of weight screening at dental appointments increased with age (_P_ = 0.004), male gender (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.66-2.36) and non-White race and ethnicity vs White (2.07; 1.42-3.03).
*   Majorities supported the dental team providing information on local weight management programmes (83.6%), having the dental team refer them to general practitioner offices/practice nurses (81.3%), and providing online resources or mobile applications (81).

IN PRACTICE:¬†
-------------

""The Making Every Contact Count [initiative](https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/population-health/our-resources-hub/making-every-contact-count-mecc) in the \[United Kingdom\] requires all healthcare professionals, including dental teams, to work collaboratively in supporting the public in using opportunistic interactions to support healthy lifestyle changes. Dental teams are suggested to be well placed to provide brief, tailored lifestyle interventions to the public,"" the authors wrote.

""Dental teams‚Ä¶must be supported by their indemnity providers and professional regulators for this to become part of routine practice. Contractual changes must reflect the need to prioritise and provide remuneration for prevention both for oral and general health. These changes would help provide assurances to dental teams that they were working within their scope of practice."" ""Equally important‚Ä¶is to empower the profession through training and establish clear protocols linking with other healthcare and weight management services,"" they added.

#AcuteKidneyInjury #DementiaRisk #Neuroscience #AgingPopulation #HealthcareResearch #PublicHealth #ClinicalPractice","Hospitalized patients with COPD misuse nearly 70% of inhalers

August 30, 2024

3 min read

Key takeaways:

* When a patient made a critical error in inhalation technique and/or had insufficient peak inspiratory flow, they had inhaler misuse.
* In the assessed study population, 82.3% used a minimum of one misused inhaler.

Inhaler misuse was high in hospitalized patients with COPD, with 69.4% of all inhalers at admission found to be misused, according to results published in _Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases: Journal of the COPD Foundation_.

‚ÄúAs a hospital physician, these findings prompt me to systematically evaluate the inhalers used by COPD patients, regardless of their reason for hospitalization,‚Äù Ga—ël Grandmaison, MD, assistant physician in internal medicine at University and Hospital of Fribourg in Switzerland, told Healio.

Data were derived from Grandmaison G, et al. _Chronic Obstr Pulm Dis._ 2024;doi:10.15326/jcopdf.2024.0505.

‚ÄúIn response to these findings, we have implemented a systematic and standardized assessment of inhaler use among our patients, aiming to correct inhalation techniques or replace the inhaler if necessary,‚Äù Grandmaison continued. ‚Äú[This intervention](https://smw.ch/index.php/smw/article/view/3394/5882) has significantly reduced the number of improperly used inhalers at hospital discharge.‚Äù

In a cross-sectional study, Grandmaison and colleagues evaluated 96 patients (mean age, 71.6 years; 63% men) in the internal medicine division of Fribourg Hospital with a diagnosis of COPD to find out how many patients in this population misuse inhalers via physiotherapist assessments and the In-Check Dial G16 (Alliance Tech Medical) over 9 months.

Researchers cited inhaler misuse when a patient made a critical error in inhalation technique and/or had insufficient peak inspiratory flow (PIF).

The total cohort had 160 inhalers, and nearly 70% (111 inhalers) had been misused. In the entire study population, 82.3% of patients used a minimum of one misused inhaler.

‚ÄúNumerous studies have highlighted the significant issue of improper inhaler use in outpatient settings,‚Äù Grandmaison said. ‚ÄúOur study confirms that this problem is also widespread.‚Äù

A critical error in inhalation technique was behind more instances of inhaler misuse than insufficient PIF (105 inhalers; 65.6% vs. 22 inhalers; 13.8%), and this was also reflected in the proportions of patients who used a minimum of one inhaler with a critical error (81.3%) and had insufficient PIF (21.9%).

In an effort to determine if targeted teaching can change the prevalence of inhaler misuse, researchers had physiotherapists carry out up to three teaching sessions and reassessed the number of inhalers with critical errors after each one.

With each additional session, fewer inhalers had been used with critical errors (one session, 33 inhalers; two sessions, 15 inhalers; three sessions, nine inhalers).

Five patients had cognitive disorders that inhibited them from reaching an adequate inhalation technique, according to researchers. A lack of coordination between inhaler activation and inspiration (n = 4) was another factor preventing adequate inhalation technique, followed by fine motor disorders and the inability to hold one‚Äôs breath sufficiently (each n = 2).

Researchers further assessed how many inhalers were unsuitable, meaning they ‚Äúcannot be used optimally, either because of an insufficient PIF or because of an inability to use an inhaler optimally despite specific teaching,‚Äù and found 27 (16.9%). Use of at least one unsuitable inhaler was noted in 25% of the study population.

‚ÄúSuboptimal inhaler use is associated with poor disease control, more frequent hospitalizations and increased costs,‚Äù Grandmaison told Healio. ‚ÄúThe prevalence of improperly-used inhalers is alarming, and strategies to address this issue are urgently needed.‚Äù

Among those hospitalized with a COPD exacerbation, 62.2% of the inhalers in this subgroup had been misused, whereas in the group of those hospitalized without an exacerbation, 85.7% of inhalers had been misused.

Additionally, those hospitalized for a respiratory compliant misused 65.9% of the inhalers in this subgroup, which was lower than the 82.4% of misused inhalers in the group not hospitalized for a respiratory compliant.

‚ÄúThese results underscore the critical importance of assessing inhalation technique and providing appropriate therapeutic education,‚Äù Grandmaison told Healio. ‚ÄúThey also highlight the need to evaluate a patient‚Äôs inspiratory capacity and ensure that the chosen inhaler matches their specific needs.‚Äù

With both this study and the study mentioned above on the intervention that lowered the number of improperly used inhalers at discharge completed, Grandmaison plans to continue researching the intervention.

‚ÄúThe next step is to evaluate the impact of such an intervention on symptom control and disease progression,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAdditionally, our goal is to adapt the strategy developed in our department for use in outpatient care.‚Äù

- Recent research in _Nature Medicine_ emphasizes the benefits of plant-based unsaturated fats over saturated dairy fats in reducing cardiometabolic risks.
- There's growing evidence supporting dietary guidelines that recommend replacing saturated fats with healthier alternatives, despite ongoing debates about the certainty of this evidence.
- A novel multi-lipid score (MLS), derived from extensive blood lipid profiling, showcases how changes in dietary fat quality can influence health outcomes, specifically type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
- Intervention trials reveal that individuals with a poorer MLS initially benefit more significantly from diets rich in plant-based unsaturated fats, highlighting the need to consider individual metabolic states.
- While this research sheds light on ideal dietary fat sources, continued validation in diverse populations is needed for broader applicability of findings.

#AcuteKidneyInjury #DementiaRisk #Neuroscience #AgingPopulation #HealthcareResearch #PublicHealth #ClinicalPractice","Groundbreaking lipid profiling uncovers how plant-based fats dramatically enhance heart and metabolic health, paving the way for precise dietary interventions.

A recent research briefing published in the journal _Nature Medicine_ reported associations between dietary fat quality and cardiometabolic risk.

The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks the evidence for the health benefits of substituting specific nutrients for others (e.g., mono- and poly-unsaturated fats for saturated fat) as low to moderate. According to the WHO, the current dietary guidelines advocating for reduced consumption of saturated fats are based on evidence of moderate certainty but remain a topic of ongoing debate.

Besides, the main drawbacks of existing intervention trials assessing different dietary fat types are shorter durations and reliance on indirect measures, e.g., cholesterol, instead of clinical endpoints (incident type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular events). Furthermore, observational studies evaluating the health outcomes of lower saturated fat intake are prone to confounding and often do not report the effects of specific nutrient substitutions.

The study and findings

In the present briefing, researchers utilized extensive blood fat composition profiling in different types of studies and observed associations between dietary fat quality and cardiometabolic risks. They combined data from dietary intervention studies that precisely controlled the types and sources of dietary fats with long-term observational studies that monitored disease occurrence over extended periods.

The researchers conducted extensive blood lipid profiling and developed/validated a multi-lipid score (MLS). The score reflected the effects of an intervention on the concentrations of 45 lipid metabolites, serving as a surrogate for metabolic adaptation to dietary fat changes. This approach allowed them to evaluate the implications of altering dietary fat quality on cardiometabolic health more precisely. The team leveraged the MLS to assess the implications of changes in the quality of dietary fats on cardiometabolic health in population studies.

Further, subgroup-specific effects were analyzed in a long-term intervention trial. The differences in MLS, which aligned with the impact of substituting saturated dairy fat with plant-based unsaturated fat, were associated with a significantly lower incidence of type 2 diabetes (in a dietary intervention trial) and cardiovascular disease (in prospective cohort studies).

Persons with initially worse MLS exhibited a stronger decrease in diabetes risk when on a Mediterranean diet rich in plant-based unsaturated fats than those with favorable MLS. This finding highlights the importance of the initial metabolic state in determining the effectiveness of dietary interventions. Substituting saturated fats from dairy products, e.g., butter, with plant-based unsaturated fats could result in substantially reduced cardiometabolic risks.

Conclusions

The study contributes important evidence supporting the current guidelines on the optimal source and quality of dietary fat but also underscores ongoing debates and limitations in the existing evidence base. The researchers addressed previous limitations of evidence underlying these guidelines by integrating randomized controlled trials and observational studies. The findings highlight the cardiometabolic benefits of replacing saturated fat from dairy products with unsaturated fat from plant products.

The authors said, ‚ÄúThe enthusiasm our work has generated encourages us to apply omics profiles for integrating data from cohorts and trials to other nutrition research questions.‚Äù However, they cautioned that their multi-study strategy is not without limitations.

While this multi-study approach addressed previous research biases, the team did not perform independent studies to establish thresholds for decision-making, examine cost-effectiveness, and validate absolute effect sizes on all metabolites. However, they cautioned that their multi-study strategy is not without limitations.

Additionally, the observed associations need validation in diverse racial and ethnic groups, as the study populations were primarily of European descent. Overall, the findings open avenues for more precise targeted interventions of dietary fat quality through lipid profiling. However, the application of lipidomics scores for dietary risk prevention requires further validation in future randomized controlled trials, particularly in more diverse populations.

Alan Percy, MD, discussed what the FDA approval of trofinetide (Daybue) has meant to patients with Rett syndrome aged 2 years and older.

Alan Percy, MD, Professor of Pediatrics, Neurology, Neurobiology, Genetics, and Psychology at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and the lead author for the LILAC-1 and LILAC-2 studies, recently discussed significant advancements in the treatment of Rett syndrome, highlighting the FDA approval of trofinetide (Daybue; Acadia Pharmaceuticals), approved on March 13, 2023. Percy also discussed the recent long-term safety data for trofinetide, based on a pair of open-label extension studies LILAC-1 and LILAC-2.1,2

""Actually, it's quite interesting that while there is great enthusiasm among parents of children, the survival in Rett syndrome is quite long. So average survival is over age 50. So, many adult women with Rett syndrome are also taking this medication,"" Percy explained, noting the trofinetide approval marked a significant milestone in the direct management of Rett syndrome symptoms.

Percy emphasized the groundbreaking nature of this treatment, noting that ""this was the first product that was ever has been developed and approved by the FDA for direct treatment of the signs or symptoms of Rett syndrome. Other medications we use are for symptomatic care, but nothing has been available previously to direct at the basic underpinnings of Rett syndrome.""

The pivotal trial for this treatment, known as the LAVENDER trial, was a ""double-blind, placebo-controlled study lasting 12 weeks,"" Percy explained. The trial utilized the Rett Syndrome Behavioral Questionnaire (RSBQ) and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) as primary endpoints to measure the treatment's effectiveness. ""What is quite remarkable is at the end of the first pivotal trial, 12 weeks both the RSBQ and the CGI-I showed improvement.""

LILAC-1 was a 40-week, open-label extension of the LAVENDER trail and evaluated safety and efficacy of trofinetide in patients with Rett syndrome aged 5 to 21 years. LILAC-2 was a 32-month open-label extension evaluating trofinetide in females aged 5 to 22 years who had completed LILAC-1, according to Acadia Pharmaceuticals.1

The most common side effects in the trials were diarrhea and vomiting.1

Percy acknowledged that while the treatment shows significant promise, it is not without challenges. ""I think it is important to mention that diarrhea can be a substantial problem, and there may be individuals who have to stop the treatment simply because the diarrhea is not manageable."" However, he pointed out that strategies have been developed over time to manage this side effect more effectively. ""We start at 50% of the recommended weight-based dose, and we gradually increase to the point of maximum tolerability.""

The Phase 1/2 study of VAX-31 demonstrated that the vaccine was well tolerated and elicited strong opsonophagocytic activity immune responses across all 31 evaluated serotypes.

Vaxcyte is a company developing vaccines to combat bacterial diseases. Its pipeline includes conjugate and protein vaccines for preventing and treating infectious diseases.

Vaxcyte, Inc has announced positive topline results from its Phase 1/2 study of VAX-31, a 31-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) candidate. The study, which involved 1,015 adults aged 50 and older, found that VAX-31 was well tolerated and elicited strong opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) immune responses for all 31 serotypes evaluated. Notably, VAX-31 met or exceeded regulatory immunogenicity standards for all 31 serotypes at middle and high doses, showing significant improvements over Prevnar 20 (PCV20) for several serotypes.

‚ÄúWe are exceptionally proud to share these results, which we believe validate VAX-31‚Äôs potential as a best-in-class pneumococcal vaccine capable of raising the bar for immunogenicity standards,‚Äù said Jim Wassil, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Vaxcyte. ‚ÄúThe public health community continues to highlight the need for broader-protection vaccines to prevent IPD, which is associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and meningitis. To address this need, VAX-31 was designed to increase coverage to more than 95% of IPD circulating in adults 50 and older in the United States, with the potential to provide significantly greater coverage relative to today‚Äôs standard-of-care adult PCVs.‚Äù1

### Main Takeaways

1.  Vaxcyte‚Äôs VAX-31 vaccine showed strong immune responses and was well tolerated in a Phase 1/2 study of 1,015 adults aged 50 and older.
2.  VAX-31 met or exceeded immunogenicity standards for all 31 serotypes and demonstrated superior responses compared to Prevnar 20 for several serotypes.
3.  Vaxcyte plans to advance VAX-31 to a Phase 3 trial by mid-2025 and initiate a Phase 2 infant study to offer broader protection against pneumococcal disease.

The randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding study compared three dosage levels of VAX-31 to PCV20, assessing its safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity over six months. Results showed that VAX-31 at the high and middle doses met non-inferiority criteria for all 20 common serotypes with PCV20, and demonstrated statistically superior immune responses for several serotypes. The vaccine also met superiority criteria for 11 additional serotypes unique to VAX-31.

[Back in February](https://www.contagionlive.com/view/vaxcyte-completes-enrollment-for-its-phase-1-2-trial-for-innovative-pneumococcal-vaccine-vax-31), Vaxcyte completed enrollment for the Phase 1/2 trial of VAX-31, a 31-valent PCV designed to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding study, which involves 1,015 participants, is evaluating three dosage levels of VAX-31 compared to PCV20.

Streptococcus pneumoniae causes PD, leads to severe infections such as meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia. It results in around 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the US The World Health Organization and the CDC classify Streptococcus pneumoniae as a top antibiotic-resistant threat. It is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in children under five and causes over 50% of bacterial meningitis cases in the US The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains highlights the urgent need for a more effective vaccine.

Looking ahead, Vaxcyte plans to advance VAX-31 into a Phase 3 program, with a pivotal non-inferiority study set to begin by mid-2025. Additionally, a Phase 2 study of VAX-31 in infants is planned for early 2025. VAX-31 aims to provide broader protection against pneumococcal disease, potentially covering more than 95% of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) strains in adults. As a novel 31-valent PCV, it represents a significant advancement in pneumococcal vaccination, seeking to enhance coverage and efficacy beyond current standard vaccines.

The FDA has approved FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx as companion diagnostics to be used with olaparib, abiraterone, and prednisone or prednisolone BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Two prostate cancer cells in the final stage of cell division: ¬©PRB ARTS - stock.adobe.com

The FDA has approved the FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx as companion diagnostics for the combination of olaparib (Lynparza) and abiraterone (Zytiga) with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

‚ÄúThis approval reinforces the importance of testing for genomic mutations at metastatic diagnosis to help guide treatment decisions,‚Äù said Mia Levy, MD, PhD, chief medical officer at Foundation Medicine, in a press release. ‚ÄúOur high-quality tissue and liquid biopsy companion diagnostic tests will allow more patients to access genomic testing, regardless of specimen type, and will simplify complex decisions by generating the best information to enable better decision-making. There is a critical unmet need for first-line treatment options for patients with BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and this combination therapy is an important advancement.‚Äù

This approval marks Foundation Medicine‚Äôs seventh FDA-approved companion diagnostic in prostate cancer. In May 2020, the FDA approved the FoundationOne CDx in patients with homologous recombination repair gene-mutated mCRPC who had progressed following treatment with enzalutamide (Xtandi) or abiraterone. In November 2020, the Liquid CDx was approved as a companion diagnostic for olaparib to identify patients with mCRPC harboring BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM alterations.

The FoundationOne companion diagnostics can analyze over 300 cancer-related genes using either blood or tissue samples. The approval of both tissue- and blood-based diagnostic tools provides greater access and flexibility for patients to benefit from genomic testing, particularly with the poor prognosis associated with BRCA-mutated mCRPC.

‚ÄúThis is an important milestone for men with aggressive prostate cancer,‚Äù said Courtney Bugler, president and chief executive officer of ZERO Prostate Cancer, in the press release. ‚ÄúBiomarker testing is an important tool for patients and families to help facilitate personalized treatment decision making, and we applaud Foundation Medicine for these additional companion diagnostic indications.‚Äù

- A comprehensive study followed 39,312 women aged 45+ over 22 years, revealing no significant link between migraine history and an increased risk of PD.
- Of the 685 women diagnosed with PD during the study, only 18.7% had a history of migraine, contrasting sharply with the majority (81.3%) who did not.
- The findings suggest that migraine, regardless of frequency or subtype, does not elevate the risk for PD compared to non-migraine headaches.
- This outcome offers reassurance to women living with migraines, alleviating concerns about future Parkinson‚Äôs disease risk.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

A history of migraine is not associated with an elevated risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) in women, regardless of headache frequency or migraine subtype, a new study suggests.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Researchers analyzed data on 39,312 women health professionals aged ‚â• 45 years and having no history of PD who enrolled in the Women's Health Study between 1992 and 1995 and were followed until 2021.
*   At baseline, 7321 women (18.6%) had migraine.
*   The mean follow-up duration was 22 years.
*   The primary outcome was a self-reported, physician-confirmed diagnosis of PD.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   During the study period, 685 women self-reported a diagnosis of PD.
*   Of these, 18.7% of reported cases were in women with any migraine and 81.3% in women without migraine.
*   No significant association was found between PD risk and a history of migraine, migraine subtypes (with or without aura), or migraine frequency.
*   Migraine was not associated with a higher risk for PD than nonmigraine headaches.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""These results are reassuring for women who have migraine, which itself causes many burdens, that they don't have to worry about an increased risk of Parkinson's disease in the future,"" study author Tobias Kurth, Charit√© - Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, said in a [press release](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1054724%3F).

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study was led by Ricarda S. Schulz, MSc, Charit√© - Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin. It was [published online](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209747) on August 21 in _Neurology_.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

The study's findings may not be generalizable to other populations, such as men and non-White individuals. The self-reported data on migraine and PD may be subject to inaccuracies. PD is often not diagnosed until symptoms have reached an advanced stage, potentially leading to cases being underreported. Changes in the status and frequency of migraine over the study period were not accounted for, which may have affected the results.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The authors did not disclose any specific funding for this work. The Women's Health Study was supported by the National Cancer Institute and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Two authors reported having financial ties outside this work. Full disclosures are available in the original article.

- A recent study reveals that GPs can effectively detect early cognitive impairment using MoCA during routine consultations.
- Early cognitive impairment typically manifests between ages 50-60, highlighting the need for proactive screening in this age group.
- While the Mini Mental State Examination is commonly used, MoCA offers greater sensitivity and specificity for mild cognitive impairment detection.
- In a feasibility study involving 61 GPs, 221 MoCA assessments were completed, averaging just 8 minutes per test.
- Remarkably, 62% of patients screened were identified as having mild neurocognitive impairment, underscoring the prevalence in primary care settings.

Implementing MoCA in routine practices can enhance early detection and support strategies for patients and caregivers. Let's share thoughts on integrating cognitive assessments into daily practice!

**Background** GPs can detect cognitive impairment at a very early stage, allowing early support for people and their caregivers. The early onset of cognitive impairment is between 50 and 60 years. Currently, in France, the Mini Mental State Examination remains the most used screening test, though it has a lower sensitivity and specificity than the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for detecting mild cognitive impairment, taking an average of 15 minutes to complete.

**Aim** To investigate the feasibility of the MoCA during routine consultations in general practice for the early detection of cognitive impairment and to determine prevalence of cognitive impairment in a primary care setting.

**Design & setting** A quantitative, prospective feasibility study was carried out in real-life working condition during routine consultation.

**Method** GPs performed MoCA on adults aged 50 years and older, without suspected or confirmed cognitive impairment.

**Results and Conclusion** 61 GPs performed 221 MoCA with a mean duration of 8 minutes and detected mild neurocognitive impairment in 62% of patients. The MoCA is feasible and easy to perform during routine consultations in general practice by trained and experienced physicians.

- A recent study involving 50 patients revealed a high rate of exposed bone following extractions performed post-radiation therapy (RT).
- The cohort observed a staggering 40% incidence of exposed bone at the 2-year mark for those who underwent extractions, compared to just 7% for those who did not.
- The median time to extraction was about 64.5 days after RT, raising concerns about the timing and safety of these procedures.
- Notably, the study found that 40% of participants declined dental extractions post-RT, highlighting the need for patient education on the risks involved.
- Outcomes included cases of osteoradionecrosis, emphasizing the urgency for improved guidelines and strategies surrounding dental care during head and neck cancer treatment.

These findings prompt important discussions on the timing and management of dental extractions in patients undergoing head and neck radiation. How can we better support these patients in clinical settings?

Key Points  
**Question** Does a window of opportunity exist for extraction of nonrestorable teeth recommended at baseline to be performed immediately following radiation therapy (RT) to the head and neck?  

**Findings** In this cohort study, 50 patients were observed, 30 patients complied with post-RT extractions at a median (range) of 64.5 (13-152) days post-RT. The 2-year cumulative incidence of exposed bone after postradiation extractions was 40%.  

**Meaning** This study found that the rate of exposed bone was intolerably high, despite performing planned extractions soon after RT.  

Abstract  

**Importance** Nonrestorable teeth are recommended to be extracted prior to radiation therapy (RT). Occasionally, preradiation extractions introduce unacceptable delays in treatment initiation. Planned dental extractions immediately postradiation presents an alternative strategy, though outcomes are uncertain.  

**Objective** To evaluate the feasibility and safety of dental extractions immediately postradiation.  

**Design, Setting, and Participants** A prospective cohort study including patients planned for curative-intent RT but unable or unwilling to proceed with 1 or more extractions recommended pretreatment was carried out. From January 2020 to September 2022, 58 patients were screened and 50 enrolled. The dental care was performed at a single academic department and the cancer care at regional centers. Analysis took place between September 22, 2023, and June 10, 2024.  

**Exposure** On completion of RT, patients were recommended to complete extractions as soon as feasible, and ideally within 4 months.  

**Main Outcomes and Measures** The primary end point was the actuarial cumulative incidence of exposed alveolar bone noted by any practitioner at any time after extraction, calculated using Gray method with death as a competing risk. As a pilot study, no formal power calculation was performed; resources allowed for 50 evaluable patients.  

**Results** Among the 50 participants enrolled, RT was nonoperative for 32 patients (64%) and postoperative for 18 patients (36%). Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) was delivered in all patients. Of the 50 patients, 20 (40%) declined dental extractions immediately postradiation and the remaining 30 (60%) underwent a median (range) of 8.5 (1-28) extractions at a median (range) of 64.5 (13-152) days after RT. The median (IQR) follow-up for survivors without exposed bone was 26 (17-35) months from the end of RT. The 2-year cumulative incidence of any exposed bone was 27% (95% CI, 14%-40%). The 2-year incidence of exposed bone for those who underwent dental extractions immediately postradiation was 40% (95% CI, 22%-58%) and 7% (95% CI, 0%-22%) for those who did not. Of the 13 who developed exposed bone: 4 resolved, 1 was lost to follow-up, and 8 were confirmed as osteoradionecrosis.  

**Conclusions and Relevance** This cohort study found that postradiation dental extractions incur considerable risk, even if performed within a 4-month window.",gpt-4o-mini
