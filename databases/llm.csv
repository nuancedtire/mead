"2024-08-28 02:30:39","üåç Exciting developments in healthtech! Daniel Ek, the founder of Spotify, is making waves with his healthtech startup Neko Health, which recently announced its expansion into the UK. üè¥

Neko Health revolutionizes health assessment with a cutting-edge body scanning system. Since its launch in Stockholm last year, they've already performed over 3,000 scans, successfully identifying potential health issues before they evolve into serious diseases. Their technology employs over 70 sensors to gather 50 million data points in just 10-15 minutes, making preventive healthcare more accessible and efficient.  

As the urgency for early disease detection grows stronger, services like those offered by Neko Health could reshape our approach to personal health and wellness. Imagine being able to consult with a doctor shortly after a swift yet comprehensive scan! And with an impressive 20,000 patients on its waiting list in Sweden, demand for this innovative service is palpable.  

This launch aligns perfectly with the growing focus on health and longevity investments in the UK, showcasing the potential for technology to enhance our overall wellness. As professionals in the industry, it's crucial for us to stay informed and consider how we can integrate such advancements into our practices.  

What are your thoughts on the future of body scanning technologies in healthcare? Let‚Äôs discuss! ü§î

SILVER SPRING, Md., Aug. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the¬†U.S. Food and Drug Administration is providing an at-a-glance summary of news from around the agency:

*   On Thursday, the FDA issued notice of a [Warning Letter sent to AUSTROFOOD S.A.S. (Austrofood)](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4235067-1&h=3583532912&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Ffood%2Fcfsan-constituent-updates%2Ffda-issues-warning-letter-manufacturer-apple-cinnamon-fruit-puree-products-containing-elevated&a=Warning+Letter+sent+to+AUSTROFOOD+S.A.S.+\(Austrofood\)), the manufacturer of the apple cinnamon fruit puree pouches that were recalled last year and that were found to contain elevated levels of lead and chromium. The letter is part of the agency's ongoing efforts to enhance the safety of cinnamon, ground spices, and other foods, particularly those consumed by babies and young children.  
      
    
*   On Thursday, the FDA [approved](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4235067-1&h=3105494854&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fdrugs%2Fresources-information-approved-drugs%2Ffda-approves-neoadjuvantadjuvant-durvalumab-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer&a=approved) Imfinzi (durvalumab, AstraZeneca) with platinum-containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, followed by single-agent durvalumab as adjuvant treatment after surgery for adults with resectable (tumors ‚â• 4 cm and/or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements. Full prescribing information for Imfinzi will be posted on [Drugs@FDA](mailto:Drugs@FDA).  
      
    
*   On Wednesday, the FDA updated the [advisory for the investigation of _Salmonella_ infections linked to cucumbers](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4235067-1&h=1481668207&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Ffood%2Foutbreaks-foodborne-illness%2Foutbreak-investigation-salmonella-cucumbers-june-2024&a=advisory+for+the+investigation+of+Salmonella+infections+linked+to+cucumbers). Laboratory, epidemiological, and traceback data have determined that cucumbers from Bedner Growers, Inc., of Boynton Beach, Florida, and Thomas Produce Company, of Boca Raton, Florida, are likely sources of illnesses in this outbreak; however, these growers do not account for all the illnesses in this outbreak. _Salmonella_ Braenderup was detected in samples of canal water used by Thomas Produce Company. [Whole Genome Sequencing](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4235067-1&h=1358715129&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Ffood%2Fmicrobiology-research-food%2Fwhole-genome-sequencing-wgs-program&a=Whole+Genome+Sequencing) analysis determined that the water used by Thomas Produce Company contained the _Salmonella_ that is a match to a strain of Salmonella Braenderup that is causing some of the illnesses in this outbreak. Thomas Produce Company's cucumber growing and harvesting season is over. There is no product from these farms on the market and likely no ongoing risk to the public.  
      
    
*   On Wednesday, the FDA advised consumers in [Skip the Antibacterial Soap; Use Plain Soap and Water](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4235067-1&h=1129208214&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fconsumers%2Fconsumer-updates%2Fskip-antibacterial-soap-use-plain-soap-and-water&a=Skip+the+Antibacterial+Soap%3B+Use+Plain+Soap+and+Water) that there isn't evidence to show that over-the-counter (OTC) antibacterial soaps are better at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water. In fact, some data suggest that antibacterial ingredients could do more harm than good over the long-term.  
      
    
*   On Wednesday, the FDA [approved](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4235067-1&h=1075184747&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fdrugs%2Fresources-information-approved-drugs%2Ffda-approves-axatilimab-csfr-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease&a=approved) Niktimvo (axatilimab-csfr, Incyte Corporation), a colony stimulating factor-1 receptor-blocking antibody, for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg. Full prescribing information for Niktimvo will be posted on [Drugs@FDA](mailto:Drugs@FDA).  
      
    
*   On Tuesday, the FDA released the results of the second retail sampling survey that tested dairy products for the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1). No viable virus was detected in the samples collected from retail locations and analyzed between June 18-July 31, 2024. These results strengthen previous assessments that commercial pasteurization inactivates the H5N1 virus. More information and results from first and second retail sampling surveys can be found at [Updates on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 | FDA](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4235067-1&h=4124573362&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Ffood%2Falerts-advisories-safety-information%2Fupdates-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai&a=Updates+on+Highly+Pathogenic+Avian+Influenza+\(HPAI\)+H5N1+%7C+FDA).  
      
    
*   On Tuesday, the FDA updated the [advisory](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4235067-1&h=3705517590&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Ffood%2Foutbreaks-foodborne-illness%2Finvestigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024&a=advisory), Investigation of Illnesses: Diamond Shruumz-Brand Chocolate Bars, Cones, & Gummies (June 2024), to include updated case counts. Additionally, the [list](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4235067-1&h=4026962513&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedia%2F180884%2Fdownload%3Fattachment&a=list) of store names and locations where the recalled products were available for retail sale has been updated.  
      
    
*   On Monday, the FDA granted a marketing authorization to SoClean Inc. for the SoClean 3+ bacterial reduction device for use with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) accessories \[two hoses (ResMed ClimateLine Air tubing, and SlimLine tubing) and one mask (ResMed Mirage FX mask)\] for the ResMed AirSense 10 CPAP device. The SoClean 3+ device is used in CPAP therapy for sleep apnea. It does not replace the cleaning steps recommended by CPAP device manufacturers. To date, there are no FDA cleared or approved devices for cleaning, disinfecting, or sanitizing CPAP machines.

"2024-08-28 02:30:45","üåü Exciting news in the healthtech world! Have you heard about Neko Health's expansion into the UK? Founder Daniel Ek, best known as the Spotify CEO, launched this innovative healthtech startup to revolutionize preventive care through state-of-the-art body scanning technology.

Recently reported by Sifted, Neko Health has already completed over 3,000 scans since its opening in Stockholm last year, and their new facility in London is set to open this summer. This expansion comes after securing ‚Ç¨60 million in funding to facilitate broader European operations. Neko's advanced scanning technology utilizes over 70 sensors to gather an astonishing 50 million data points in just 10-15 minutes, helping detect issues like skin cancer and cardiovascular diseases early on.

The implications of this technology for our healthcare system are profound. By detecting health issues sooner, we not only enhance patient outcomes but can also significantly reduce long-term healthcare costs. As the UK continues to attract investments in longevity and healthtech, Neko Health‚Äôs arrival is timely and promising.

What are your thoughts on body scanning technology in preventive health? Could it become a standard part of our health check-ups in the future?

Rare diseases point to connections between metabolism and immunity
==================================================================

by [Vanderbilt University Medical Center](http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/VUMC)

![Image 2: Rare diseases point to connections between metabolism and immunity](https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2024/rare-diseases-point-to.jpg)

Jeffrey Rathmell, Ph.D., left, and Andrew Patterson, Ph.D., have discovered a new set of metabolic genes that are important for immune cell function. Credit: Vanderbilt University Medical Center

Inherited diseases of metabolism and immunity have more in common than previously recognized, according to a new study published in the journal _[Science Immunology](http://10.0.4.102/sciimmunol.adh0368)_. The findings point to a new set of metabolic genes that are important for the function of immune system T cells, and they offer insights that could improve care for patients with these disorders.

The study examined [genes](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genes/) that cause inborn errors of metabolism (disorders of the processes that [cells](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cells/) use to convert food to energy) and inborn errors of immunity (disorders that affect immune system function). These rare and complex diseases are not fully understood.

""There had previously been only a small number of genes that were on both lists of diseases, but we found that many more have overlap,"" said Andrew Patterson, Ph.D., who led the study as a postdoctoral fellow working with Jeffrey Rathmell, Ph.D., at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""Our study showed that a large number of genes associated with inborn errors of metabolism can also potentially affect T cell function when they are mutated.""

The findings suggest that patients with an inborn error of metabolism may also have immune defects that could impact their care, and conversely that metabolic defects may contribute to symptoms in patients with inborn errors of immunity.

""There's a lot more that will have to be learned, but these connections might point to different therapies,"" said Rathmell, Cornelius Vanderbilt Professor of Immunobiology and director of the Vanderbilt Center for Immunobiology. ""Rather than different categories, these diseases are part of a continuum; there's a gray zone between them and a potential new class of inborn errors of immunometabolism that intersects the two.""

Patterson and the research team used a gene-editing CRISPR approach to screen the [inborn errors of metabolism](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inborn+errors+of+metabolism/) genes for immune defects and the inborn errors of immunity genes for metabolic defects. They further analyzed one example from each set‚Äîone metabolic gene that had an immune defect; one immunity gene that had a metabolic defect‚Äîto more carefully examine the mechanistic impact.

Overall, Rathmell's team is interested in discovering how [metabolic pathways](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+pathways/) regulate T cell function, with the goal of developing targeted therapies for immune-mediated disorders.

""What we've done is lay the foundation for further investigation,"" Patterson said. ""The two examples we studied in detail point to new biology and new mechanisms, and there are hundreds of other genes we identified to analyze for their roles in T cell function.""

The findings are available on a [website](https://figs.app.vumc.org/figs/) for other researchers to use.

""If you're trying to understand the connections between metabolism and immunity, this is a great place to start,"" Rathmell said.

Patterson recently joined the faculty of the University of Louisville as an assistant professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics. Vanderbilt collaborators Vivian Gama, Ph.D., associate professor of Cell and Developmental Biology, and Janet Markle, Ph.D., assistant professor of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, were important contributors to the study.

Daniel Ek‚Äôs body scanning healthtech Neko Health is expanding to the UK
=======================================================================

The company raised ‚Ç¨60m for international expansion in July last year
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[Mimi Billing](https://sifted.eu/author/mimibilling/)

2 min read

Spotify founder Daniel Ek‚Äôs healthtech startup Neko Health opened its first body scanning facility in Stockholm in February last year and has gone on to complete 3,000 scans. Now it‚Äôs [heading to London](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nilsonne_london-we-are-coming-activity-7190613829859315713-4QsD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) with a launch planned for this summer.

In February last year, the Swedish company raised a [‚Ç¨60m Series A](https://sifted.eu/articles/neko-health-raises-series-a-news), led by Lakestar with the participation of Atomico and General Catalyst, for European expansion. At the time, the company didn‚Äôt want to specify which countries it had in mind.

Neko Health‚Äôs main product is a [full-body scanning system](https://sifted.eu/articles/ek-neko-body-scanner-test) for broad and non-invasive health data collection, which the company wants to make quicker, more convenient and more affordable. By catching potential diseases earlier, it hopes to increase the chances of treating them and reduce the cost of healthcare in the long term.

Within hours of its official launch in February last year, all the slots at its first body-scanning clinic in Stockholm had sold out.

The body-scanning procedure takes 10-15 minutes and is followed by a consultation with a doctor. Neko says its scanner uses over 70 sensors to collect 50m data points and can, for instance, detect tiny skin changes. That could help doctors detect diseases like skin cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other metabolic syndromes earlier.

A scan will set you back ‚Ç¨250 but the fee doesn‚Äôt seem to put people off. Neko has 20k patients on its waiting list in Sweden and has opened its international waiting list, the company says, where plenty of Brits have signed up.

### Origin story

The startup, founded by Daniel Ek and entrepreneur Hjalmar Nilsonne in 2018, was in stealth until its official launch last year. Before launching its body scanning facility the company opened [a primary care clinic](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-ek-secret-healthtech-startup) in Stockholm, which the founders are still running alongside the body scanning facility.

Before raising its Series A, Ek invested about ‚Ç¨30m in the company, partly through his moonshot investment vehicle Prima Materia.

The UK has seen the [most investments in longevity](https://sifted.eu/pro/briefings/longevity-2024) in Europe ‚Äî making London a natural choice for Neko.

Markdown Content:
In mid-2022, things didn‚Äôt look great for the digital health startup Joint Academy. The digital therapeutics startup for arthritis patients had just lost its largest paying customer ‚Äî a healthcare region in Sweden ‚Äî over a quarrel about how many sessions each patient should be allowed.

The mess put Joint Academy, which had been backed by well-known Swedish investors such as [Sophia Bendz](https://sifted.eu/articles/sophia-bendz-podcast-interview), Kinnevik, H&M owner Carl-Johan Persson and Alfven & Didrikson, on the brink of bankruptcy.

But in the 18 months since, the startup has dramatically turned things around. It‚Äôs now expanded to the UK, runs seven physical clinics in Sweden and is about to acquire a clinic in the US.

How did it turn things around?

### Humble pie

When Joint Academy fell out with its biggest customer, it lost 80% of its recurring revenue.

The company was on its knees ‚Äî and until its dispute with the customer, a regional health provider, was resolved, none of Sweden‚Äôs other 20 regional health services would work with the business either.

Cofounder Jacob Dahlberg learnt his lesson. ‚ÄúYou have to be humble,‚Äù he says when Sifted visits him at the opening of Joint Academy‚Äôs latest physical clinic in Nacka, a suburb of Stockholm.

‚ÄúThe situation was anything but perfect, but we have come out stronger and have a brand new business today than we would have built if this hadn't happened,‚Äù he says.

Apart from humility, Dahlberg also learnt not to rely on one large customer. The company has seven individual contracts with two regions in Sweden and also works with private health providers.

‚ÄúWe have a completely different and diversified revenue base now,‚Äù he says.

### From digital to digi-physical

Joint Academy launched in 2014, offering digital therapies to arthritis patients. Working with regional health providers it was reimbursed for its services as a digital health provider.

In May 2023, Joint Academy acquired the first of its seven physical clinics. It gained access to the clinics‚Äô patients and was able to broaden its speciality from arthritis to any kind of physiotherapy need.

In addition, owning clinics meant Joint Academy wasn‚Äôt limited to the reimbursements that digital health providers receive.

‚ÄúWe believed that both owning and running physical care clinics was strategically the right decision,‚Äù Dahlberg says. ‚ÄúThis is also something that we now see in our results. We‚Äôve seen a lot of healthcare companies that only work digital that have a tough time now \[because of the reimbursement system\].‚Äù

It‚Äôs not the only digital health startup that has branched into physical health. One of Europe‚Äôs biggest digital health startups, Kry, now operates over [60 physical clinics](https://sifted.eu/articles/kry-profitable-in-all-markets-we-wouldnt-have-managed-it-as-quickly-without-ai-news) across its three markets.

‚ÄúIf you own a clinic you have a natural flow of patients daily,‚Äù explains Dahlberg, who‚Äôs on the verge of acquiring a physical clinic in the US ‚Äî which currently doesn‚Äôt have a digital offering. ‚ÄúIf we bought it, we could add software and start offering telemedicine, digital therapeutics and those things.‚Äù

Joint Academy already has several contracts with insurance companies in the US, as well as a new contract with the UK‚Äôs largest private hospital provider Circle Health Group. As part of an NHS pilot project with the Highland and Islands in Scotland, it is also testing its digital therapeutics on a few thousand patients waiting for a hip or knee prosthesis operation. At present, the waiting time for surgery is over a year.

‚ÄúSo far we‚Äôve seen fantastic data with about every fifth treated patient changing their mind about surgery,‚Äù Dahlberg says.

In the future, Joint Academy is also looking to acquire clinics in the UK.

#### Where did the money come from?

In 2022, Joint Academy‚Äôs revenue more than halved ‚Äî dropping from almost 200m SEK (‚Ç¨17m) in 2021 to 79m SEK (‚Ç¨6.8m) in 2022. Losses also piled up, reaching 130m SEK (‚Ç¨11m) in 2022.

The company, which had raised a total of ‚Ç¨30m from its investors, needed fresh capital to avoid the risk of bankruptcy. Luckily, the investors still believed in the business.

‚ÄúThey supported us throughout ‚Äî it wouldn‚Äôt have been possible otherwise,‚Äù Dahlberg says. ‚ÄúWe had a very open dialogue wether to accelerate or put the brakes on the business.‚Äù

The investors agreed a convertible loan of 191m SEK (‚Ç¨16m) in 2022, according to the annual report. As written in the annual report, it says that the company has secured further funding early in 2023 as part of a package of cutting costs in terms of staff expenses ‚Äì and a lot of the staff were subsequently made redundant.

Dahlberg also stepped down as CEO earlier this year to focus on the US market and COO Emil Hansson took over as chief exec.

Today, things have changed dramatically. The company is expecting an annual revenue of 200m SEK (‚Ç¨20m) and expects a positive EBITDA in the second quarter of this year, according to Dahlberg.

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve learnt is the importance of having a diversified revenue base. We have that now,‚Äù he says.
