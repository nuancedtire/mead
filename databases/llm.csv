===============

Rubella infection may increase MS risk in unvaccinated people
=============================================================

Having antibodies against the rubella virus is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) in unvaccinated people, a Swedish study suggests.

The findings show a rubella infection may be a risk factor for MS, reinforcing the hypothesis that certain viral infections may trigger the misleading immune response that drives MS.

‚ÄúTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between [rubella virus] and MS in pre-¬≠MS samples,‚Äù wrote the researchers, who said additional studies will be needed to confirm the association between rubella infection and MS.

The study, ‚Äú[Rubella virus seropositivity after infection or vaccination as a risk factor for multiple sclerosis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.16387),‚Äù was published in the _European Journal of Neurology._

[MS is caused](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/) by an erroneous immune response that damages healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord. The reason for the immune response isn‚Äôt fully understood, but evidence suggests viral infections may be risk factors. Infection with the [Epstein-Barr virus](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/) (EBV), in particular, is one of the strongest risk factors for the neurodegenerative condition and some studies have found an association between MS and the human herpesvirus-6A. Also, up to 78% of MS patients have antibodies against measles, varicella zoster, and rubella viruses in their spinal fluid.

It‚Äôs believed that, due to some similarities between viral and human molecules, the immune system may mistakenly attack nerve cells when trying to fight a viral infection. This ‚Äúmolecular mimicry‚Äù is one proposed mechanism that may explain the association between viruses and a greater risk of MS.

The rubella virus has several proteins that share similarities with human proteins. One protein from its envelope, called E2, is similar to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), an essential protein in [myelin](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/), the fatty coating that covers nerve cells and target of immune responses in MS.

These similarities raise the possibility of a connection between the rubella virus, the immune response against it, and developing MS.

Researchers in Sweden compared blood samples from MS patients and controls collected before the neurological disease‚Äôs onset to determine if people who developed MS had signs of a previous rubella infection ‚Äî determined through the presence of anti-rubella antibodies ‚Äî before their diagnosis.

‚ÄúWith samples from both the pre-¬≠vaccination era and through the different stages of rubella vaccination in Sweden, we explored a unique opportunity to study [the rubella virus] in the field of MS,‚Äù the researchers wrote.

The study included blood samples from 670 MS patients and 670 matched controls. In both groups, female patients represented the majority (84%) and the median age was 25.

The researchers tested the samples for the presence of antibodies (seropositivity) that targeted the rubella E1 protein, which the virus uses to infect human cells, and their reactivity. More MS patients (93.7%) had anti-E1 antibodies than healthy controls (88.5%), data showed.

When patients and controls were divided based on their rubella vaccination status, seropositivity was only significantly higher in MS patients than controls in unvaccinated people, in whom the presence of antibodies indicates a previous rubella infection. After adjusting for factors such as antibodies against other viruses and vitamin D levels, unvaccinated MS patients were four times more likely to have rubella antibodies than unvaccinated controls. No significant differences were observed in vaccinated patients after accounting for the same factors.

The presence of antibodies in ‚Äúunvaccinated subjects (i.e., representing rubella infection) was associated with a higher risk of developing MS,‚Äù the researchers wrote. ‚ÄúMolecular mimicry is an attractive hypothesis for a possible mechanism behind these findings.‚Äù

The researchers advised caution when interpreting their findings, mainly because the test they used to determine seropositivity can have a lot of false negatives. Also, most of the participants received the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, adding variables that weren‚Äôt evaluated in the study.

‚ÄúFurther serological and epidemiological studies are needed to support our findings,‚Äù they wrote.",gpt-4o-mini,pRuzqAYgt3LdrVYEBLmf

Regeneron is the second pharma group to sign up for access to data from a remote study run by health technology firm Koneksa that is exploring the use of digital biomarkers to track patients with Parkinson's disease.

The LEARNS trial ‚Äì which started earlier this year ‚Äì is using smartphone and wearable technologies to monitor disease progression in Parkinson's patients and find ways to use digital biomarkers in the development of disease-modifying therapies.

Regeneron has become a member of the data syndication programme for LEARNS, joining MSD/Merck & Co, which signed up in March, and will have real-time access to data and results from the study. Those can be used for ""natural history analysis, trial design, cohort formation, and data analysis,"" according to the partners.

Quantitative tools for measuring progression are lacking in Parkinson's and other neurological disorders, with clinicians relying on subjective measures that make it harder to monitor patients, particularly as the rate of symptom decline fluctuates and varies wildly between individuals with the disease.

LEARNS is set to enrol up to 70 participants with Parkinson's who will be followed for 12 months, with first results expected next year. It uses the Koneksa neuroscience toolkit, which combines iPhone-based active assessments and passive monitoring using a wrist-worn wearable.

""Detecting the earliest signs of Parkinson's disease and establishing the necessary evidence of validity for new measures are critical needs within the healthcare community,"" said Chris Benko, Koneksa's chief executive.

""Our goal is to bring together biotech and pharma companies with real-time data sharing and analysis to expedite the validation and adoption of digital measures to unlock more data insights in clinical trials,"" he added.

Other projects looking at digital biomarkers for Parkinson's include the crowd-sourced DREAM Challenge, which saw 40 research teams from around the world contribute ways to process accelerometer and gyroscope data from consumer wearable devices that can be used to track muscle tremor, dyskinesia, and bradykinesia - three prominent symptoms of the disease.

Regeneron's pipeline doesn't currently include a clinical-stage treatment for Parkinson's, but it is working on drugs for other neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

""At Regeneron, we believe that digital biomarkers have the potential to improve the development of novel therapeutics, and collaboration helps make this a reality,"" said the company's head of clinical development for genetic diseases, Gary Herman.

===============

STOCKHOLM, Sept. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Diamyd Medical will pursue an accelerated approval pathway in the U.S. for its antigen-specific immunotherapy, Diamyd¬Æ (rhGAD65/alum), aimed at preserving endogenous insulin production in patients with Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes. An earlier interim study readout from the ongoing Phase 3 trial, DIAGNODE-3, is planned to serve as the basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) under the accelerated approval pathway. Results from the interim readout are expected around March 2026.

""We are committed to working at full speed with our partners and in close dialogue with the FDA to seize this unprecedented opportunity of making Diamyd¬Æ available to patients as quickly as possible,"" says Ulf Hannelius, CEO of Diamyd Medical. ""The earlier readout from the DIAGNODE-3 trial represents a critical step in this process and our confidence in Diamyd¬Æ's disease-modifying benefits is boosted by the positive outcome of the recently announced futility analysis. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to ensure that all necessary regulatory requirements are met.""

Diamyd Medical recently announced Fast track designation in the U.S. for Diamyd¬Æ, and that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has acknowledged that accelerated approval could be sought based on a demonstration of significant treatment-related benefits on C-peptide levels, a measure of endogenous insulin production, in response to Diamyd¬Æ administration. The FDA's Accelerated approval program allows drugs for serious conditions that fills an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. Using a surrogate endpoint allows the FDA the potential to approve these drugs faster.

To prepare the BLA under the FDA's Accelerated Approval Program, Diamyd Medical plans to conduct an interim study readout, including efficacy data from approximately 170 participants who have completed their 15-month assessment and safety data from additional individuals enrolled in the DIAGNODE-3 trial. The primary endpoint for this analysis will be C-peptide, a surrogate endpoint now recognized by the FDA as reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Following the interim readout, the DIAGNODE-3 trial will continue to follow all enrolled patients until the 24-month end-of-study assessment. To date, 148 patients have been randomized in DIAGNODE-3. The results of the interim study readout are expected around March 2026, the exact time depending on the final number of participants to be included in the readout, followed by submission of a BLA under the accelerated approval pathway.

The DIAGNODE-3 trial, which is being conducted in eight European countries and the United States, is expected to fully recruit approximately 330 patients by the end of 2025, and all patients are expected to be fully treated before the time the earlier readout is to be performed. The trial focuses on recently diagnosed patients with Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes carrying the HLA DR3-DQ2 genotype; a subgroup of approximately 40% of Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes patients that has been shown to respond to Diamyd¬Æ in previous trials.

**About Diamyd Medical**

Patients in England and Wales with a rare genetic disorder will soon be able to access treatment with MSD's Welireg via the NHS, nearly a year after their counterparts in Scotland.

In final draft guidance due to be finalised before the end of the month, Welireg (belzutifan) has been recommended as an option for treating adults with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a rare and life-shortening disease that can lead to the development of benign and cancerous tumours and cysts.

Specifically, Welireg becomes an option for VHL-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), brain and spinal cord tumours (haemangioblastomas), or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) when localised treatment like surgery isn't appropriate.

Until now, the only therapies available to patients with VHL have been invasive surgery or radiotherapy, with patients usually requiring multiple surgeries throughout their lives.

There are only about 600 adults in England living with the condition, and around 100 of them could be eligible for treatment with Welireg, with another 50 cases per year thereafter.

The decision comes after NICE withheld a recommendation for the drug last December, saying there were ""uncertainties"" in the clinical and economic evidence submitted for its appraisal. The SMC in Scotland backed NHS use of the drug in October 2023.

The new NICE recommendation is conditional, meaning that Welireg can be used while more evidence for its efficacy is collected, according to Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE. It comes after NHS England reached a commercial access deal with the manufacturer.

The appraisal committee heard from patient experts who explained that some people with VHL have a wide variety of debilitating symptoms depending on where the tumours are growing in the body. These include pain, loss of balance and motor skills, loss of vision, breathlessness, coughing, headaches, confusion, severe nausea, and fatigue.

Graham Lovitt, chair of patient advocacy group VHL UK/Ireland, said Welireg has ""game-changing potential"" and has shown extraordinary results for some patients in trials, including stabilisation of the tumours, reduction in growth, and ‚Äì in some cases ‚Äì the eradication of tumours altogether.

""We are delighted by NICE's recommendation of belzutifan [‚Ä¶] a significant milestone in the fight against this rare disease,"" he added. ""This decision brings hope to qualifying patients and their families, offering them an alternative treatment option, when others become too high risk.""

Welireg (belzutifan), an oral HIF-2 alpha inhibitor, has been approved by the UK drugs regulator the MHRA for VHL since May 2022. MSD acquired it as part of its $2.2 billion takeover of Peloton Therapeutics in 2019.

Despite the rarity of VHL tumours, MSD has blockbuster aspirations for Welireg, and now has a second regulatory approval for the drug in relapsed or refractory advanced RCC, with clinical trials on the go in glioblastoma multiforme, a hard-to-treat form of brain cancer.",gpt-4o-mini,jEeJnAOcL0yV3CfCLdzE

======================================================

The mRNA vaccine candidate more effectively limited symptoms and disease duration in non-human primates.

A study, funded by Moderna, the National institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) compared an investigational mRNA mpox vaccine from Moderna to a currently licensed Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine. The new mRNA vaccine candidate more effectively limits symptoms and disease duration in non-human primates infected with a lethal strain of mpox.

Alec Freyn, virology researcher at Moderna and co-first author, stated: ‚ÄúThis study is the first in a nonhuman primate model where we compare an investigational mRNA mpox vaccine directly to the current standard of care.‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúWhen we put those vaccines head-to-head in primates, we saw improved responses from the mRNA vaccine in terms of not just protection from survival but also fewer lesions, shorter duration of disease, and less viral shedding in the blood and respiratory tract.‚Äù

Originally designed to combat smallpox, MVA vaccines contained weakened whole viruses. Yet, this weakening means that they provide limited protection compared to other vaccines. The use of mRNA technology enables vaccines to be developed to only include parts of the virus that are most likely to induce a lasting, protective immune response without exposing the person to a whole infectious virus. The investigational mpox mRNA vaccine is composed of four viral antigens that are essential for the virus to attach and enter host cells.

Previous research has demonstrated that mRNA vaccines can prevent lethal mpox infections in nonhuman primates but their ability to lessen disease severity has not been tested. Therefore, to directly compare the investigational mRNA vaccine to MVA vaccines, the team vaccinated six macaques with each vaccine and then exposed them to a lethal strain of mpox virus eight weeks after their initial vaccine dose. Also, they exposed a control group of six unvaccinated animals to mpox. Then, after infection, the researchers monitored the macaque‚Äôs health for four weeks and collected blood samples to study their immune response.

Disease severity
----------------

Five of the unvaccinated control animals did not survive, whereas all 12 vaccinated animals did, regardless of which vaccine was used. The mRNA-vaccinated animals lost less weight and had fewer lesions than MVA-vaccinated animals, despite both vaccines limiting disease severity compared to the control group.

Furthermore, the mRNA vaccine shortened disease duration, measured by the number of days for which the animals showed lesions, by more than 10 days compared to the MVA vaccine. Lower viral loads were in the blood and throat swabs, indicating that it might be more effective at reducing transmission.

Jay Hooper, virologist at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and senior author explained: ‚ÄúWith the mRNA technology, we‚Äôre able to produce a vaccine that gives quite potent responses with a very tolerable safety profile‚Ä¶We‚Äôve been trying to get a vaccine that will prevent spread like ACAM2000¬Æ but without the safety issues. This is showing that mRNA technology might be able to fill that niche.‚Äù

Immune response
---------------

The mRNA vaccine resulted in a higher number of antibodies and antibodies with more diverse immune functions. Different classes of antibodies that were associated with enhanced viral control and fewer lesions were identified.

Furthermore, the vaccine demonstrated potential to induce cross-immunity to other Orthopoxviruses, whereas the MVA vaccine results in smaller immune responses that are not as strongly neutralising for more remotely related Orthopoxviruses. Serum from the macaques immunised with the mRNA vaccine ‚Äúneutralised not only mpox but also vaccinia, cowpox, rabbitpox, camelpox, and ectromelia virus,‚Äù Freyn said. ‚ÄúWe believe that this vaccine may protect from other Orthopoxvirus threats that may emerge in the future.‚Äù

Now, Moderna‚Äôs mRNA-1769 vaccine is being assessed in a Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT05995275) to determine the safety, tolerability and immune response of a range of doses of mRNA-1769.

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","GSK says Nucala hits the target in new COPD trial

GSK's severe asthma therapy Nucala could find a new lease of life as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) after showing a clear benefit in a phase 3 trial.

The headline result from the MATINEE trial of IL-5 inhibitor Nucala (mepolizumab) in adults with COPD was a statistically significant reduction in the annualised rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared to placebo that GSK said was ""clinically meaningful."" In the study, Nucala was added to inhaled maintenance therapy for COPD.

GSK has been studying Nucala in COPD for some time, and in 2017 reported mixed results for the drug in two earlier phase 3 trials called METREX and METREO.

METREX involved patients with a range of eosinophil levels and showed a statistically significant improvement for Nucala versus placebo on exacerbation rates. However, in METREO ‚Äì which focused on patients with higher levels only ‚Äì the difference between the two arms was not significant.

The company decided to file for approval regardless, but the FDA declined to approve the new indication in 2018, following the advice of an advisory committee, which found that GSK had not proved efficacy. It seems MATINEE will allow GSK to try its luck again.

The size of the improvement over placebo ‚Äì which reportedly extended for up to two years in the trial ‚Äì won't be available until the study is presented at a future medical congress, but is strong enough to warrant discussions with regulators about extending the indications for Nucala, according to the pharma group. It has previously suggested approval for COPD could come in the US in the first half of next year.

Nucala has been approved to treat severe eosinophilic asthma for almost a decade, and in the interim has had its label extended to include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome.

The drug remains one of GSK's top products, with sales of ¬£856 million ($1.1 billion) in the first half of this year, up 15%. COPD could open up a massive new market for the drug, which still has several years of patent life left before it could face biosimilar competition.

The lung disease affects more than 300 million people globally, with up to 40% of patients exhibiting type 2 inflammation characterised by a raised blood eosinophil count, which would make them suitable for treatment with Nucala.

Elevated eosinophil levels are associated with more severe COPD and a higher rate of exacerbations, the sudden flare-ups in symptoms that signal the progression of the disease and can lead to hospitalisation.

The MATINEE data comes at a time when options for COPD are on the up, after a decade with no new therapies.

In July, the European Commission became the first regulator worldwide to approve Sanofi and Regeneron's big-selling IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor Dupixent (dupilumab) as a treatment for the progressive lung disease, shortly after Verona Pharma got the go-ahead from the US FDA for its PDE 3/4 inhibitor Ohtuvayre (ensifentrine).

Dupixent ‚Äì which is due for a verdict from the FDA as a COPD therapy later this month ‚Äì was cleared for adults with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils, while Ohtuvayre can be used in all patients regardless of eosinophil levels.",gpt-4o-mini,4RiH0v4OthWjjKQAg9uu

Earlier this week, I visited one of Paris‚Äô few longevity clinics dedicated to preventative medicine ‚Äî and the only one that describes itself as a tech startup.

Hidden behind an unassuming Haussmannian door, just a few minutes away from the Paris Opera, the centre has been operating for nine months. The startup behind it, Zoƒ´, promises customers a ‚Äú360-degree check-up‚Äô ‚Äî a three-hour series of tests and exams, ranging from blood tests to eye scans through spirometry and gut microbiome analyses.

The objective? Collect millions of data points on up to 200 biomarkers that are in turn analysed by an AI model, in order to deliver lifestyle recommendations that, promises Zoƒ´, will prevent disease and improve customers‚Äô long-term wellness.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about adding years of life, but rather life to years,‚Äù says Zoƒ´ cofounder ‚Äî and former special advisor to French president Emmanuel Macron ‚Äî Isma√´l Em√©lien. ‚ÄúThe goal is to learn the body‚Äôs ‚Äòuser manual‚Äô to prevent illnesses and enable people to live in good health for longer.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not for everyone. Membership to Zoƒ´ is ‚Ç¨3.6k per year, which includes an annual checkup as well as the follow-up recommendations. That‚Äôs roughly the cost of a membership to Soho House, says Zoƒ´'s CFO Antoine Attali ‚Äî and the startup's customers usually belong to the same social circles.

The clinic caters to premium needs, from snacks elaborated by world-famous chef Alain Ducasse to a balneotherapy section modelled on ‚ÄòJapanese thermal baths‚Äò, featuring a snow cabin (?) and a mineral bath that is, I am told, ‚Äútwice as salty as the Dead Sea‚Äù.

Attali tells me that in the long-term, Zoƒ´ hopes to become accessible to everyone, and that prices will go down to a similar level to your average WiFi subscription.

For now, though, preventative health remains a hobby of the upper-class. In fact, Zoƒ´'s investors are all private individuals; the company‚Äôs ‚Ç¨20m seed round, which it raised in 2022, included a good number of high-profile billionaires such as Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saad√© and Moderna CEO St√©phane Bancel.

And Zoƒ´ is not the only longevity startup appealing to the ultra-rich. Spotify founder Daniel Ek is behind similar ventures, including [Sand Clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-ek-spotify-sand-clinic-longevity-news), where customers can receive full body check-ups and treatments ranging from vacuum therapy to red light saunas ‚Äî with membership expected to cost between ‚Ç¨1,000 and ‚Ç¨10,000 a month.

Ek is also the founder of healthtech Neko Health, which has built a full-body scanner for health data collection that it says helps doctors detect potential diseases earlier. The company [has a clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/ek-neko-body-scanner-test) and has just opened a new spot in London, right in the middle of Marylebone, where it prices a one-hour scan at ¬£299 ‚Äî almost double the price of a visit to the Stockholm clinic when it opened in 2023 (‚Ç¨180).

Despite the cost, the proposition seems appealing enough. Neko Health says it already has a waiting list of 22k people; Zoƒ´ says it has ‚Äúaround 1k members‚Äù to date and is currently carrying out a dozen check-ups per day ‚Äî but the startup is confident that it can ramp up to reach its maximum capacity of 35k annual check-ups in the next five years.

Whether or not the preventative treatments promised by startups like Zoƒ´, Neko Health and Sand Clinic will ever reach the masses remains to be seen; what seems certain for now is that billionaires won‚Äôt get tired of full-body-scanning anytime soon.

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","UK-based healthtech Doccla has secured a ¬£35m Series B, led by European VC Lakestar, with new investors French VC Elaia and existing investors General Catalyst, Speedinvest and the investment leg of German media company Bertelsmann also participating.

Having almost quadrupled its annual revenue in 2023, it's planning its expansion in DACH and France, and says its German and French investors will help its international growth plans.

The startup, founded in 2019, makes ‚Äúvirtual ward‚Äù technology for healthcare providers. It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.

Doccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland‚Äôs Health Service Executive (HSE).

Doccla‚Äôs founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.

‚ÄúWith the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it‚Äôs a huge opportunity to scale,‚Äù says Ratz.

The virtual A&E

Sweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.

According to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.

Patients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.

So far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it‚Äôs adding 1k new patients every month.

‚ÄúOver time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,‚Äù Ratz says.

Partnering with pharma

Doccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).

‚ÄúWe have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,‚Äù Ratz says. ‚ÄúThis is because we are in very close contact with our patients.‚Äù

Doccla says it‚Äôs interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he‚Äôs seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.

With 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.

In one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.

‚ÄúWe can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits ‚Äî in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,‚Äù Ratz says.

Doccla has raised a total of ¬£52m to date.

In October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.",gpt-4o-mini,9nj2Jph5BejAt6HcNWLs

Caresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.

### AI for hospitals

Caresyntax says it wants to build the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals‚Äô surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.

The company‚Äôs platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.

While some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax‚Äôs platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.

‚ÄúEffectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,‚Äù they add.

If it does what it sets out to do, it‚Äôs a big opportunity.

Costs associated with operations account for 30% of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends 11% of GDP on health.

Founded in 2013 in Germany ‚Äî Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 ‚Äî its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company‚Äôs revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","The meteoric rise of a new class of weight loss drugs over the past two years, known as GLP-1s, has seen a new name take the title of Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, helped a country dodge a recession and hit grocery sales in the US.

The valuations of the companies that make this so-called ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù class of drugs ‚Äî which includes Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and US rival Eli Lilly (maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) ‚Äî have soared as investors bet big on a medication projected by some to hit $150bn in sales by the early 2030s.

The potential of the market has not been lost on founders.

It‚Äôs a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù opportunity, says Kai Eberhardt, the founder and CEO of Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform which operates in the UK, France and Germany, alongside its home market. It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.

‚ÄúFor us [GLP-1 drugs] are already a strong growth driver,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.‚Äù

While treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva‚Äôs overall business ‚Äî Eberhardt says it‚Äôs growing total patient and revenue numbers by ‚Äúdouble digit‚Äù percentage points year-on-year ‚Äî the meds could become the startup‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest‚Äù growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.

### Riding the wave

Oviva‚Äôs not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity ‚Äî many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.

In the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart‚Äôs CEO, food sales have fallen as the one in eight adults in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, propping up Denmark‚Äôs GDP in the process.

All of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have convinced them to get out their chequebook: Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a ‚Ç¨10m Series A in August 2023 a year on from a ‚Ç¨3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised ‚Ç¨3.1m last summer.

Many startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn‚Äôt start life offering them ‚Äî largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.

UK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs health‚Äù brand, but has recently changed that. The company‚Äôs website uses images of men and women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.

Yazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.

Meurling tells Sifted it had hit ‚Ç¨14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It‚Äôs now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.

Other startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men‚Äôs sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.

‚Äú[GLP-1 meds] are a game changer,‚Äù says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be ‚Äústrange‚Äù if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn‚Äôt looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.

While GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the ‚Äúhype‚Äù surrounding the drug class has ‚Äúopened doors‚Äù for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler ‚Äî adding that the startup managed to raise its ‚Ç¨400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It‚Äôs now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it‚Äôll look to target US employers ‚Äî who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.

### Kinks in the supply chain

There are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector ‚Äî not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.

Some of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate‚Äôs $100m in 2021 and Form Health‚Äôs $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than ‚Ç¨10m in a single round.

Investors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics ‚Äî Manual was still selling past the deadline.

If a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.

‚ÄúAs there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.‚Äù

### Who‚Äôll stump up the cash?

There‚Äôs also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.

While Numan‚Äôs head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the ‚Äúsuccess of private sector companies offering GLP-1 [drugs] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS‚Äù, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won‚Äôt be enough to hit real scale.

‚ÄúUS investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts [selling to whole organisations like health insurers],‚Äù says Syhler. ‚ÄúThis means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care ‚Äî where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.‚Äù

In Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.

In the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.

Oviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS ‚Äî but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it‚Äôs in ‚Äúmature dialogues with several health systems‚Äù.

- A recent large-scale study involving 2.4 MILLION GERMAN WOMEN suggests a significant association between mastitis and breast cancer, especially in females aged 50 and above.  
- Out of nearly 15,000 WOMEN WITH MASTITIS, 2.9% were diagnosed with breast cancer compared to 2.4% of the matched control group.  
- The hazard ratio of 1.73 indicates a 73% INCREASE in cancer risk for those over 50 with mastitis, highlighting the importance of vigilant monitoring in this demographic.

TOPLINE:
--------

Mastitis in women over 50 years of age is a risk factor for development of breast cancer, according to a large retrospective cohort study of 2.4 million German women. Mastitis is an inflammation of breast tissue typically caused by a Staph infection.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   This study was a retrospective cohort of 2,381,594 women in 315 office-based gynaecology practices in Germany (2005-2021).
*   Women with mastitis (n = 14,892) were compared with women without mastitis (n = 14,892) and followed from 7 months to 10 years.
*   The control group without mastitis was propensity score-matched on age, index year, average yearly consultation frequency during the follow-up period, and coexisting conditions.
*   The primary outcome was an initial diagnosis of breast cancer.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Over the follow-up period, 2.9% of the mastitis cohort and 2.4% of the matched non-mastitis cohort developed breast cancer.
*   While Cox regression analysis uncovered a significant association between mastitis and breast cancer (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.11-1.70), the age-stratified analysis revealed a significant association only among women aged > 50 years. They had a 73% increase in the risk compared with women without mastitis (hazard ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.25-2.40).
*   Women aged ‚â§ 50 years had no significant increase in the risk for breast cancer.

IN PRACTICE:
------------

The authors concluded that ""The findings of our retrospective cohort study support an association between mastitis and subsequent breast cancer diagnoses in women aged > 50 years. The pathophysiological basis and possibility of confounders however requires further investigation.""

2024-09-09 18:00:00,2024-09-11 00:41:08,"ü´Ä Did you know that impaired heart rate fluctuations can significantly impact mortality risk in diabetic patients? 

- A recent study presented at the EASD Annual Meeting revealed that patients with diabetes displaying low daily heart rate variability (HR SD) face nearly double the risk of cardiovascular death compared to those with healthier fluctuations. 
- Among the 349 participants (predominantly Type 2 diabetes), 39% died over a 21-year follow-up, with a staggering 68% of these deaths being cardiovascular-related.  
- The study suggests that patients who experience a blunted nocturnal heart rate dip are associated with a 39% higher risk for mortality‚Äîall highlighting the critical need for monitoring heart health. 
- By implementing 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), healthcare professionals can better stratify risk in this vulnerable population, potentially leading to earlier interventions. 

As we advance in diabetes management, how can we incorporate these heart rate metrics into routine clinical evaluation? ü§î

**TOPLINE:**
------------

MADRID ‚Äî Impaired circadian heart rate (HR) fluctuations are linked to increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with long-standing diabetes.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Researchers analyzed data from 349 patients with type 2 (81%) or type 1 diabetes; about half were women, with a mean age of 57 years, body mass index (BMI) of 29.4, and A1c of 8.6%.
*   Participants underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (APBM) and HR monitoring, as well as assessment of diabetic microvascular complications.
*   The median SD value of ABPM-derived HR measurements was used to define patients with low daily HR fluctuations (low 24h-HR SD); a < 10% decline in average nighttime vs daytime HR identified patients (31%) with a blunted nocturnal HR dip.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   Low 24h-HR SD and blunted nocturnal HR dip were associated with an adverse cardiometabolic risk profile and a high prevalence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy and nephropathy.
*   After a mean 21 years of follow-up, 136 (39%) deaths occurred, of which 100 (68%) had a cardiovascular cause.
*   After adjustment for potential confounders ‚Äî including age, sex, BMI, glycemic control, diabetes type, and hypertension ‚Äî the low 24h-HR SD group had double the risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.99) for cardiovascular mortality and a 50% higher risk (HR, 1.50) for all-cause mortality than the high 24h-HR SD group.
*   Patients with a blunted nocturnal HR dip consistently had a 39% higher adjusted risk for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.61 for both) than those with a preserved nocturnal HR dip.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

Impaired circadian HR fluctuations are associated with microvascular disease and increased long-term cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes, the authors wrote. ""Identifying these conditions via 24h-ABPM may provide a cost-effective risk stratification tool in this high-risk population.""

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study was presented by lead author Lorenzo Nesti, PhD, of the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in a poster presentation 983 at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2024 Annual Meeting in Madrid, Spain.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

The CHAMPION study is a retrospective, observational, single-center study with mostly White patients.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

Nesti disclosed no conflicts of interest.
