Recent findings from the CheckMate-9ER study reveal intriguing insights into the role of serum glycoproteins in predicting treatment outcomes for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here‚Äôs what we learned:

- GLYCOSYLATION PATTERNS MATTER: Increased fucosylation and sialylation of serum proteins correlate with poorer outcomes for patients treated with nivolumab (Opdivo) plus cabozantinib (Cabometyx) compared to sunitinib (Sutent).
- POTENTIAL PREDICTIVE BIOMARKERS: High serum levels of CO3 glycopeptide may indicate a favorable response to the nivolumab-cabozantinib combination, while low levels of CFAH glycopeptide suggest a similar trend.
- CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study emphasizes the need for effective biomarkers to identify which patients will benefit most from anti‚ÄìPD-1 therapies, as current genomic approaches may not capture the full picture.
- LONG-TERM EFFICACY: The combination therapy continues to show significant improvements in progression-free survival (16.4 months vs. 8.4 months) and overall survival (46.5 months vs. 36.0 months) compared to sunitinib.

As we delve deeper into the complexities of protein glycosylation, could these findings pave the way for personalized treatment strategies in RCC?

CheckMate-9ER post hoc analysis suggests certain sugar molecules on blood proteins may predict how well nivolumab and cabozantinib in kidney cancer treatment works.

More fucosylation and sialylation of serum proteins showed to be negative prognostic factors for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and linked with worse clinical outcomes for nivolumab (Opdivo) plus cabozantinib (Cabometyx) and sunitinib (Sutent) treatment, according to findings from an exploratory post hoc analysis of the phase 3 CheckMate-9ER study (NCT03141177).

The data, which were shared during the 2024 ESMO Congress, also suggested that serum glycoproteins involved in complement cascade and lipid metabolism could be predictive of response to the doublet vs sunitinib in this disease, according to David A. Braun, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine (Medical Oncology) and Louis Goodman and Alfred Gilman Yale Scholar at Yale School of Medicine, in New Haven, Connecticut. Specifically, high serum levels of CO3 glycopeptide are potentially predictive of favorable response to the nivolumab plus cabozantinib vs sunitinib, as are low serum levels of CFAH glycopeptide.

‚ÄúWe see that higher amounts of protein glycosylation, both sialylation and fucosylation, appear to be prognostic in this data set, and that specific protein glycosylation events related to lipid metabolism, but also related to the complement cascade, have the potential to [possibly] be predictive of response in anti‚ÄìPD-1-based therapy, as opposed to sunitinib,‚Äù Braun said in a presentation of the data. ‚ÄúBut I want to highlight this is really early exploratory work. I [believe] the main question is, is this an area for further investigation in biomarker development in RCC? And I [believe] the answer to that is, yes.‚Äù

CheckMate-9ER enrolled patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with a clear cell component. They could have disease of any risk by International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria, but they needed to have tumor tissue available for analysis.

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 240 mg of intravenous (IV) nivolumab every 2 weeks paired with 40 mg of oral cabozantinib once daily vs 50 mg of oral sunitinib on a cycle of 4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off. Treatment continued until disease progression by RECIST v1.1 criteria or intolerable toxicity. Stratification factors included IMDC risk score, tumor PD-L1 expression, and geographic region.

The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review committee (BICR) and RECIST 1.1 criteria. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) by BICR and RECIST 1.1 criteria, as well as safety. Health-related quality of life served as an important exploratory end point.

In January 2021, the FDA approved nivolumab plus cabozantinib for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC based on earlier data from CheckMate-9ER. Data from the 55-month follow-up of the study shared during the 2024 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium showed that nivolumab plus cabozantinib continues to provide a meaningful improvement over sunitinib in PFS, OS, and ORR. In the intention-to-treat population, the PFS by BICR was 16.4 months (95% CI, 12.5-19.3) with the doublet vs 8.4 months (95% CI, 7.0-9.7) with sunitinib (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49-0.70). The median OS with nivolumab plus cabozantinib was 46.5 months (95% CI, 40.6-53.4) vs 36.0 months (95% CI, 29.2-42.8) with sunitinib (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95). The ORR by BICR was 55.7% with the doublet vs 27.7% with sunitinib.

‚Äú[Although] anti‚ÄìPD-1‚Äìbased therapy is really the standard for first-line RCC, we still lack effective biomarkers to figure out which patients are likely to respond, and which tumors are likely to be resistant to therapy. Our group, and many others, have focused largely on the genomics and transcriptomics of the tumor itself, but we know that posttranslational modifications of proteins themselves play an important role in those proteins‚Äô function,‚Äù Braun said. ‚ÄúIn fact, glycosylation of protein, altered glycosylation, is a hallmark of cancer and involved in many malignant processes. Hypersialylation in particular, engages sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin receptors and is known to be immunomodulatory, potentially raising the idea that it could contribute to anti‚ÄìPD-1 resistance.‚Äù

For the post hoc analysis, Braun and colleagues evaluated the link between site-specific glycopeptide modifications with nivolumab plus cabozantinib/sunitinib response in patients with advanced RCC by leveraging pre-treatment serum samples. They used the InterVenn GlycoVision platform to conduct a glycoproteomic analysis, to understand if altered protein glycosylation is a possible avenue for biomarker studies in RCC. They identified 24 serum glycopeptides that were linked with PFS or OS with the doublet.

‚ÄúThe first question is, how are these regulated? Are they regulated in a coordinated fashion or not? We looked across patients for site-specific protein glycosylation, [and what] we can see is highly coordinated modules of altered protein glycosylation, [with] red piercing correlations across patients for these different site-specific glycosylations,‚Äù Braun said. ‚ÄúNow, in our initial study and our initial look at these particular proteins, we can see that these coordinated modules seem to be associated with altered PFS and OS with nivolumab plus cabozantinib, either positively or negatively. So, this gave us some initial insight for further study, that these are highly coordinated and potentially associated with clinical outcome.‚Äù

Braun added that the next question posed by the investigators was whether the total amount of glycosylation is important and if it plays a role in clinical outcomes. To that end, they examined the total amount of 2 forms of glycosylation: sialyation and fucosylation.

‚ÄúWe see basically an increasing amount of glycosylation, the number of amino acid residues that have a sialic acid or a fucose residue. As we can see, for both nivolumab [plus] cabozantinib and sunitinib, when you have more glycosylation, you have a higher hazard ratio, [which is] essentially worse PFS and OS with more protein glycosylation,‚Äù Braun explained. ‚ÄúThis at least raises the potential that this could be prognostic and really reinforces prior studies seen in melanoma. So that‚Äôs a potential prognostic role.‚Äù

They then set out to evaluate whether this marker could be predictive for response to the doublet vs the monotherapy. When they look across several protein glycosylations, 2 patterns emerged, Braun noted. ‚ÄúOne, proteins involved in lipid metabolism, and the second were members of the complement cascade,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOne is CO3. And what we can see is that at low levels of protein glycosylation, there‚Äôs [essentially] no difference between nivolumab plus cabozantinib or sunitinib with respect to PFS, but at high levels of protein glycosylation, this is where we see tremendous benefit from nivolumab plus cabozantinib. This is hypothesis generating. This is a proinflammatory complement protein, so could this be mediating complement-induced antitumor activity?‚Äù

The opposite pattern was observed for CFAH glycopeptide. He noted that high levels of the checkpoint did not show benefit from the doublet whereas when the protein glycosylation was low, substantial benefit was observed with the combination. ‚ÄúThe hypothesis is that this negative regulator of alternate complement activity, when it‚Äôs low, that‚Äôs when the immune therapy is able to act,‚Äù Braun said.

He concluded that the prognostic or predictive potential of glycopeptide biomarkers should be further examined in additional clinical trials.

===============================================================================================

by University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio

New research is more closely linking obesity to dementia. Higher levels of leptin, a hormone that helps maintain normal body weight, is associated with better signal-transmitting brain white matter in middle-aged adults, according to a study by The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio).

""The findings support the known role of leptin variations in late-life dementia risk by relating its deficiency with changes in white matter structure, which is an early event in the process of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia,"" said Claudia Satizabal, Ph.D., associate professor at the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio.

Satizabal is lead author of a study titled ""Leptin bioavailability and markers of brain atrophy and vascular injury in the middle age,"" published Aug. 12 in Alzheimer's & Dementia. Other authors also are with the Biggs Institute, as well as Tufts Medical Center in Boston; the Framingham Heart Study; Boston University School of Public Health; University of California-Davis; National and Kapodistrian University of Athens; and Columbia University.

Obesity and Alzheimer's
-----------------------

Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia, impacting the lives of millions of people worldwide, the study notes. Increasing evidence suggests that midlife obesity is an important contributor to the risk of developing the disease.

This has led to a growing interest in untangling the mechanisms linking obesity to Alzheimer's, which potentially extend through vascular, genetic and metabolic pathways. The study of adipose or fatty tissue has led to significant insights.

Once viewed as a passive reservoir for energy storage, adipose tissue is now considered a part of the endocrine system, secreting a group of bioactive peptides known as adipokines, or cell-signaling molecules that play functional roles in the energy or metabolic status of the body, inflammation and obesity.

Leptin is an adipokine responsible for central control of food intake and energy homeostasis, and has been implicated in a variety of neurophysiological functions, including brain development, neurogenesis and neuroprotection.

Because of these effects, it has been considered a plausible mechanism in the pathway leading from obesity to Alzheimer's disease. It is supported by findings tying higher leptin levels to lower risk for incident Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, as well as better structural brain indicators in older adults, the study notes.

Still, studies conducted in younger individuals have not detected associations between leptin and early indicators of brain damage preceding late-life dementia risk. Researchers in the new study at UT Health San Antonio aimed to gain further insights into the potential relationships of leptin with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular burden.

Specifically, they investigated the associations of leptin markers with cognitive function and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of brain atrophy and vascular injury in healthy middle-aged adults.

They conducted neuropsychological evaluations of 2,262 cognitively healthy participants from the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term cardiovascular cohort study of residents from Framingham, Massachusetts, spanning three generations and now a project of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, in collaboration with Boston University.

The scientists measured concentrations of leptin, its soluble leptin receptor and their ratio, known as the free leptin index, indicating leptin bioavailability, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Cognitive and MRI measures were derived using standardized protocols.

The results found a higher association of the soluble leptin receptor with lower fractional anisotropy, a biomarker of brain white-matter integrity, and peak-width skeletonized mean diffusivity, an imaging marker for white-matter injury. Correspondingly, a higher free leptin index was associated with higher fractional anisotropy.

These results were replicated in a study that included 89 cognitively healthy Hispanic participants from San Antonio, by MarkVCID, a consortium of U.S. academic medical centers whose mission is to identify and validate biomarkers for the small vessel diseases of the brain that produce vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).

Taken together, the researchers concluded that higher leptin bioavailability was associated with better white-matter integrity in healthy middle-aged adults, supporting the putative neuroprotective role of leptin in late-life dementia risk.

Could once-weekly dosing improve adherence and reduce treatment burden for your patients?","Armed with $100m funding, F2G prepares to refile antifungal

Friday 20 September 2024

UK biotech F2G has raised $100 million as it prepares to refile its olorofim candidate for invasive fungal infections, which was turned down last year by the FDA.

The Manchester-based company said the new cash will help it to complete the late-stage development of olorofim, a novel oral antifungal for invasive aspergillosis and other serious fungal infections, to support the company during the regulatory review process, and prepare for a commercial launch in the US.

F2G's first attempt to win FDA approval for olorofim resulted in a complete response letter (CRL) from the agency saying there was a need for additional data that meant it would be unable to complete its review within the allotted time.

The biotech has spent the intervening period running trials to shore up the data on the drug, which it hopes could end a two-decade drought in novel therapies for invasive fungal infections in the US.

Olorofim (formerly F901318) is the first in a new class of orotomide antifungal agents intended to provide a new treatment option for serious fungal infections when the current armamentarium of azoles, echinocandins, and polyene-based medicines fail. The FDA granted F2G a breakthrough designation for olorofim in 2019.

Since the first filing, F2G has completed a phase 2b study in patients with invasive aspergillosis, scedosporiosis, lomentosporiosis, fusariosis, scopulariopsis, and coccidioidomycosis infections and limited treatment options ‚Äì which was ongoing when the FDA turned down the application in June 2023.

It has also started a 225-subject phase 3 trial called OASIS, comparing treatment with olorofim to Astellas' AmBisome (liposomal amphotericin B) in invasive aspergillosis, which should generate results next year.

Invasive aspergillosis is a serious infection that typically affects people with compromised immune systems and there are rising rates of resistance to azoles and amphotericin B, the two most effective classes of treatment.

The new financing was led by the AMR Action Fund, said to be the world's largest public-private partnership investing in the development of new antimicrobial therapeutics, and backed up by existing investors Novo Holdings, Advent Life Sciences, Sofinnova Partners, Forbion, Blue Owl Healthcare Opportunities, Morningside Ventures, Brace Pharmaceuticals, and Merifin Capital.

""For decades, clinicians have relied on a handful of antifungal classes, with few mechanisms of action and significant limitations due to spectrum of activity, drug toxicities, or drug-drug interactions,"" said AMR Action Fund's chief executive Henry Skinner, who has joined the board of F2G.

""These therapies are increasingly failing in patients,"" he added. ""We are thrilled to support F2G's team as they develop this urgently needed therapy and seek regulatory approval.""

Olorofim is licensed in Europe and Asia to Japanese pharma Shionogi, which paid $100 million upfront for rights to the drug in 2022, with F2G retaining rights in North America. F2G's last fundraising was in a $70 million round led by Forbion and Sofinnova two years ago.",gpt-4o-mini,placeholder_id_0

Key takeaways:

* Adults with type 1 diabetes had significant declines in body weight at 1 year of off-label semaglutide and tirzepatide use.
* Use of both medications was associated with reductions in total daily insulin dose.

Adults with type 1 diabetes using either semaglutide or tirzepatide off-label had greater decreases in body weight and HbA1c than those not treated with either medication, according to a speaker.

As Healio previously reported, researchers at the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus found adults with type 1 diabetes and overweight or obesity using tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound, Eli Lilly) off-label had a 0.67 percentage point reduction in HbA1c and an 18.5% decrease in body weight at 1 year. At the European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meeting, University of Colorado researchers presented more data from their institution of adults with type 1 diabetes who used tirzepatide as well as semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy, Novo Nordisk) off-label.

Data were derived from Snell-Bergeon J, et al. OP 43. Presented at: European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting; Sept. 9-13, 2024; Madrid.

‚ÄúOff-label semaglutide and tirzepatide treatment resulted in significant weight loss and improved glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes, with no reported hospitalization for hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis,‚Äù Janet Snell-Bergeon, PhD, professor of pediatrics at the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said during the presentation.

Researchers conducted a retrospective chart review of 50 adults with type 1 diabetes and overweight or obesity who used semaglutide off-label and 50 adults who used tirzepatide off-label. Propensity score matching was used to compare data from semaglutide and tirzepatide users with 50 controls with type 1 diabetes and overweight or obesity who were not treated with either medication. Changes in BMI, body weight and HbA1c were assessed over a 1-year period.

Reductions in weight, HbA1c

Adults using tirzepatide had a 7.5 kg/m2 decline in BMI and semaglutide users a 3 kg/m2 decrease in BMI from baseline to 12 months (P for treatment difference < .0001). The tirzepatide group had a significantly greater reduction in BMI than controls starting at 3 months and continuing until the end of the study, whereas semaglutide users had a significantly greater decrease in BMI than controls beginning at 6 months and continuing through 1 year.

The tirzepatide group lost 21.4% of their body weight from baseline to 1 year and the semaglutide group achieved a 9.1% weight reduction in that same period (P for treatment difference < .0001). A weight loss of 10% or more at 1 year was achieved by 87% of adults using tirzepatide and 47% of those using semaglutide compared with no participants in the control group (P < .001).

Adults using semaglutide had a 0.54 percentage point decline in HbA1c at 1 year compared with a 0.68 percentage point decrease for those using tirzepatide. Both decreases were greater than the change in the placebo group (P = .008).

Change in total, basal and bolus insulin daily dose was significantly lower for adults using tirzepatide than those using semaglutide or controls. At 1 year, there was no significant difference in the change in total, basal or bolus insulin dose between the semaglutide and control groups.

‚ÄúWhen we looked at total insulin dose per kilogram of body weight, there was a significant decrease [with tirzepatide], indicating that this went beyond just the loss of body weight and perhaps improved insulin sensitivity,‚Äù Snell-Bergeon said.

The change in BMI, body weight and HbA1c did not differ between adults receiving multiple daily insulin injections and those using an insulin pump. Snell-Bergeon said there was a trend toward greater HbA1c loss for adults receiving tirzepatide and using an insulin pump vs. semaglutide users or those using tirzepatide with multiple daily injections.

Dosing and safety

People using semaglutide began at a starting dose of 0.25 mg per week and were titrated up based on clinical guidelines. Of the group, 38 reached a maximum dose of 0.5 mg per week. For those using tirzepatide, the starting dose was 2.5 mg per week. Of the tirzepatide group, 16 reached a maximum dose of 5 mg, eight reached a maximum dose of 7.5 mg and 14 reached a maximum dose of 10 mg.

There were no reports of hospitalizations for DKA or hypoglycemia during the study. Three adults using semaglutide and one using tirzepatide discontinued the medication due to lack of response.

Snell-Bergeon said randomized controlled trials still need to be conducted to assess efficacy and safety outcomes for both medications among adults with type 1 diabetes.

Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is now an approved frontline treatment for patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma.

The FDA approved the frontline combination of pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and chemotherapy in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma. This approval is supported by findings from the 2/3 KEYNOTE-483 trial (NCT02784171). Here, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the firstline led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) vs chemotherapy alone.

The FDA has granted approval to the first-line treatment of pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma.

Data from the randomized, open-label, phase 2/3 KEYNOTE-483 trial (NCT02784171) support this approval. According to findings presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, the combination of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy led to a statistically significant improvement in OS, reducing the risk of death by 21% (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.98; 2-sided P =.0324). The median OS with the combination was 17.3 months (95% CI, 14.4-21.3) vs 16.1 months (95% CI, 13.1-18.2) with chemotherapy alone.

A significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) was also observed with the combination. The PFS was 7.13 months (HR, 0.80; 95%CI, 0.65-0.99; 2-sided P =.0372) with the combination vs 7.16 months with chemotherapy, and at 12 months, the estimated PFS rates across arms were 26% and 17%, respectively. The overall response rate (ORR) was also significantly higher for the pembrolizumab combination at 62% vs 38% with chemotherapy alone (P <.0001).

For safety, the safety profile of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in this study was consistent with what has been previously reported.

Those with measurable disease; an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; and adequate hematologic, liver, and renal function and those who had no contraindications to standard chemotherapy were eligible for enrollment in the study. Patients must have also been eligible to receive standard chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin and must have been incurable with use of standard therapies to be included in the study. Patients were permitted to have had prior radiation at least 28 days prior to registration; however, radiation to the thorax was not allowed unless clear disease progression was seen. Further, patients were permitted to have undergone previous major surgery at least 28 days prior to registration.

There were 440 patients enrolled during the phase 3 portion and randomized to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab given intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles in combination with 500 mg/m2 of pemetrexed every 3 weeks for 6 cycles and 75 mg/m2 of cisplatin every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Patients also could have been given pemetrexed plus cisplatin alone. Cisplatin could be substituted with carboplatin at an area under the curve of 5 or 6 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles in either arm.

September 18, 2024

Key takeaways:

* The antiviral reduced the risk for severe symptoms of COVID-19, need for health care and time off of work after recovery.
* The trial may inform future studies on treatment and prevention of long COVID.

The antiviral molnupiravir modestly reduces the risk for severe symptoms of COVID-19 and may also reduce the risk for long COVID, according to a randomized controlled trial.

In 2021, the MOVe-OUT trial demonstrated that molnupiravir ‚Äî one of three antivirals available to treat COVID-19 in the United States ‚Äî reduced the risk for hospitalization or death from COVID-19 by around half among unvaccinated participants.

In contrast, the PANORAMIC trial showed that molnupiravir did not reduce the risk for hospitalization from COVID-19 among vaccinated adults, but did speed recovery by 4 days, the authors of the new analysis noted.

In a follow-up to PANORAMIC, researchers randomly assigned more than 25,000 adults to receive either molnupiravir plus usual care (12,821) or only usual care (12,962) between Dec. 8, 2021, and April 27, 2022. Participants were aged at least 50 years or at least 18 years with a comorbidity, and 99.1% had received a previous dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

The researchers found that vaccinated participants treated with the antiviral experienced fewer and less severe COVID-19 symptoms, accessed health care less often and took less time off work 6 months after recovery, ‚Äúbut with small effect sizes‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh numbers needed to treat.‚Äù

Specifically, among participants in the treatment arm, molnupiravir was associated with a 1.9% reduction in severity of any severe symptoms and a 2.5% reduction in severity of persistent symptoms after 6 months. The number of participants needed to treat to achieve the benefit were 52.6 and 40, respectively.

‚ÄúThe promising results from the PANORAMIC trial are consistent with results from well-conducted observational analyses as they both converge on finding a modest effect of molnupiravir in reducing the risk of long COVID in high-risk individuals,‚Äù Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development services at Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System, wrote in a commentary published with the study.

We asked Al-Aly, who was not involved in the trial, about the significance of the findings for COVID-19 treatment and the prevention of long COVID. His answers have been lightly edited for clarity.

Healio: What stuck out to you in the results of the study?

Al-Aly: I have been waiting for the results of this large, randomized study. It clearly shows that molnupiravir reduced the risk of several important outcomes. The effect size is small, but not negligible.

Healio: What‚Äôs the bottom line on antivirals and long COVID?

Al-Aly: As it stands, the current evidence suggests that antivirals have an effect in reducing the risk of long COVID. This is evident in PANORAMIC (molnupiravir) and a study on ensitrelvir, another antiviral from Japan. It is also clear from these studies that the effect size is small ‚Äî meaning that we cannot solely rely on antivirals to completely prevent long COVID.

Healio: What should clinicians take from these findings?

Al-Aly: In high-risk individuals, antivirals reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 illness and may also reduce the risk of long COVID. They remain massively underutilized. Clinicians should be cognizant of adverse events, drug-drug interactions (for example, with Paxlovid), and the mutagenic potential of molnupiravir (it induces mutations in SARS-CoV-2). But they should also consider potential benefits.

Healio: What do you hope they take away from your related commentary?

Al-Aly: The PANORAMIC results suggest that blocking viral replication in the acute phase ‚Äî via molnupiravir ‚Äî reduced the risk of long Covid. This is an important clue ‚Äî that hitting the virus early, diminishing its ability to replicate and suppressing viral load may hold promise in preventing long COVID. We need to continue to investigate the role of antivirals in preventing and treating long COVID and figure out ways to optimize their effectiveness. Trials to test combinations of antivirals, longer duration of treatment, etc., should be pursued.

=============================================================================

This decision comes after the company submitted a complete response to the regulator.

September 18, 2024

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has lifted the partial clinical hold on Vigil Neuroscience‚Äôs Phase I trial of VG-3927, a novel treatment under development for neurodegenerative diseases.

This decision follows a complete response submitted to the regulator by the company.

The Phase I trial has now expanded to include Alzheimer‚Äôs disease patients.

In July this year, Vigil Neuroscience shared interim findings from the single- and multiple-ascending dose study of VG-3927 in healthy subjects.

The safety and tolerability data from six SAD and two MAD cohorts indicated that VG-3927 is suitable for further clinical exploration.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile also supported the potential of the asset for once-daily dosing.

In addition, VG-3927 has shown promising signs of efficacy, including a sustained decline in soluble TREM2 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), providing clinical evidence of target engagement.

The ongoing Phase I trial has now expanded to include patients suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, some of whom have TREM2 or other disease-related genetic variations.

This cohort will help assess VG-3927‚Äôs biomarker response after a single dose.

Vigil Neuroscience aims to release the complete Phase I data, including results from the Alzheimer‚Äôs patient cohort, in the first quarter of next year.

VG-3927 is a small molecule TREM2 agonist and is being developed to address neurodegenerative diseases linked to microglial dysfunction, with an initial focus on treating Alzheimer‚Äôs.

Vigil Neuroscience chief medical officer Petra Kaufmann said: ‚ÄúWe are pleased with the resolution of the partial clinical hold, a decision that was supported by non-clinical and clinical data from our ongoing Phase I trial.

CF33-hNIS has gained FDA orphan drug designation for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma and is currently being evaluated in the phase 1 MAST trial.

Orphan drug designation has been granted to CF33-hNIS (Vaxinia) from the FDA for the treatment of patients with cholangiocarcinoma. CF33-hNIS is a novel oncolytic virotherapy under investigation in the MAST trial (NCT05346484). In this phase 1 study, experts are assessing CF33-hNIS alone and in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors.

The FDA has granted an orphan drug designation to CF33-hNIS, a novel chimeric oncolytic therapy, in cholangiocarcinoma.

FDA orphan drug status is granted to encourage the development of treatments for rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US. With this designation, Imugene, the sponsor is offered several incentives, including tax credits, potential grant opportunities, exemption from specific administrative fees, and 7 years of market exclusivity following FDA approval.

‚ÄúReceiving orphan drug designation from the FDA is a major milestone for us. It reflects the potential of [CF33-hNIS] to address the urgent need for new treatments for cholangiocarcinoma, a disease with limited therapeutic options. We are excited to continue advancing this program, which has already shown meaningful clinical responses in patients,‚Äù said Leslie Chong, managing director and chief executive officer of Imugene, in a press release.

CF33-hNIS is a genetically engineered oncolytic virus that is encoded with the hNIS transgene. The agent aims to both reduce the replication of the virus in normal cells and produce selective replication in cancer cells, which leads to tumor cell lysis.

The phase 1 MAST trial is currently evaluating as CF33-hNIS alone and when combined with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors. Enrollment in the study is open to patients aged 18 years and older with a metastatic or advanced solid tumor. Patients are required to have documented radiological progression after treatment with 2 or more prior lines of therapy, which could have included an immune checkpoint inhibitor; at least 1 measurable lesion; an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2; and adequate renal, liver, and hematologic function.

In the dose escalation portion of the study, patients will receive CF33-hNIS intravenously or intratumorally at 1 of 7 doses, ranging from 8.6 x 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) to 3 x 109 PFU on days 1 and 8 of the first 21-day cycle, then on day 1 of each cycle after. Experts also will assess CF33-hNIS with pembrolizumab where pembrolizumab is being given once every 3 weeks starting on day 1 of cycle 2.

Safety and identifying the recommended phase 2 dose are the primary end points of the study, and secondary end points are overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST criteria and assessing viral replication in tumor lesions via single-photon emission computerized tomography.

Previous findings from the trial showed that in the monotherapy arm (n = 7), patients had an ORR of 14% and a disease control rate of 86%. An immunological complete response by the fourth cycle of treatment was seen in 1 patient with cholangiocarcinoma. This patient had no known recurrence after 1 year. Additionally, another patient with bile duct cancer had stable disease for more than 5 months.

For safety, CF33-hNIS given alone was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities reported. No patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse effects (TRAEs). The most commonly reported TRAEs were pyrexia (grade 1, 14.3%; grade 2, 28.6%), fatigue (0%; 14.3%), injection site pain (14.3%; 0%), folliculitis (0%, 14.3%), pneumonia (0%; 14.3%), pustular rash (14.3%; 0%), muscle spasms (0%; 14.3%), myalgia (0%; 14.3%), lymphadenopathy (14.3%; 0%), vomiting (14.3%; 0%), decreased appetite (14.3%; 0%), headache (0%; 14.3%), blister (14.3%; 0%), and erythema (14.3%; 0%). Moreover, there were no grade 3 or higher TRAEs seen.

French healthtech unicorn Alan has raised a ‚Ç¨173m Series F that has seen the company‚Äôs valuation jump to ‚Ç¨4bn.

Alan, which provides health insurance for businesses and their employees, was last valued at ‚Ç¨2.7bn when it raised a ‚Ç¨183m Series E in 2022. The company has raised a total ‚Ç¨654m since it launched in 2016.

The latest round was led by Belgian bank and insurer Belfius, and included participation from existing investors such as Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers‚Äô Pension Plan (OTPP), Singaporean investor Temasek, global investor Coatue and European VC Lakestar.

Belfius and Alan have also signed a distribution partnership meaning that the healthtech will be able to offer its services to the Belgian bank‚Äôs corporate and institutional clients. This represents ‚Äúmillions‚Äù of employees, according to Alan. Over time, Alan will also provide coverage to Belfius‚Äôs 7,000 employees.

Alan‚Äôs governance remains unchanged, according to the company, with cofounders Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve and Charles Gorintin and employees remaining the largest shareholders ‚Äî with 40% of the capital and the majority of voting rights.

A change of plans

The French unicorn told Sifted in February that it had no plans to raise again, and that it was instead focused on reaching profitability across the company by 2026.

‚ÄúTo keep to our plan, maintain [our current] level of growth and reach profitability, we don‚Äôt need to raise money,‚Äù Samuelian-Werve told Sifted at the time. ‚ÄúWe have received unsolicited offers from investors and we sometimes consider them so it is not impossible, but for now it is not our strategy.‚Äù

He also said at the time that consolidating Alan‚Äôs position in its existing markets ‚Äî France, Spain and Belgium ‚Äî was a priority.

‚ÄúThis privileged partnership with Belfius opens the door to a new era for Alan in Belgium,‚Äù Samuelian-Werve said in a press release about the latest news.

The healthtech plans to hire 25 employees in Belgium over the coming months; its current headcount is 600. It says that its objective to reach profitability by 2026 remains unchanged.

What‚Äôs next for Alan?

With this latest injection of capital, Alan plans to continue expanding internationally and to develop new tools as part of its offering.

The healthtech is especially keen to deploy AI in its products, and says that the technology will enable more personalised services and faster processing of claims.

Currently serving 650k employees across 23k businesses, Alan last reported revenue of ‚Ç¨350m and net losses of ‚Ç¨59m in 2023. It is targeting 40% revenue growth in 2024.

Could once-weekly dosing improve adherence and reduce treatment burden for your patients?","Manual, a UK-based startup selling medication and supplements for men‚Äôs health conditions, has raised ¬£29.2m, the company has confirmed to Sifted.

The healthtech issued the new shares in May and June this year, according to Companies House filings.

The round featured existing investors Felix Capital and Cherry Ventures, alongside new investor Octopus Ventures. The fresh capital takes Manual‚Äôs total funding to more than ¬£50m.

‚ÄúWe will continue using this capital to invest in delivering even better health outcomes for our patients, while ramping up our investment in technology and accelerating our expansion across Brazil,‚Äù George Pallis, CEO and cofounder, tells Sifted.

### **Treating men‚Äôs health**

Founded in 2018, Manual sells and prescribes medication, diagnostic tools and supplements for conditions ranging from erectile dysfunction and hair loss, to low testosterone and weight loss. It also provides a hair transplant service from two physical clinics in London and Leeds.

Over the past six years, Manual says it has served more than 500k patients.

Alongside its home market of the UK, Manual launched in S√£o Paulo, Brazil in 2021 ‚Äî now a key expansion target for the company.

‚ÄúWe saw an opportunity to improve quality care in a vast market where, outside of the big cities, there is limited healthcare access,‚Äù says Pallis. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve since expanded nationwide.‚Äù

### **The rise of weight loss**¬†

Manual‚Äôs offering has grown considerably since it last raised external funding ‚Äî in a [$30m round in 2021](https://sifted.eu/articles/manual-raises-30m). Back then the startup was only offering treatment for erectile dysfunction and hair loss.

One of its more recent areas of care include dispensing a [new class of weight loss drugs](https://sifted.eu/articles/startups-wegovy-ozempic-shift) that have taken the world by storm ‚Äî GLP-1s (most famously sold under the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy, produced by Novo Nordisk).

Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand, and popularity of Ozempic to treat weight loss has caused shortages of the drug for diabetic patients ‚Äî who it was initially intended for.

Supply chain issues are slowly improving, and Manual is just one of a number of European startups looking to tap into the wave of consumer interest in using GLP-1 drugs for weight loss.

‚ÄúAs there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing,‚Äù Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC, told Sifted via email in August.

UK-based Numan, which like Manual marketed itself as a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs health‚Äù brand for years and began life selling treatment for erectile dysfunction, has also recently broadened its offering to include weight loss treatment.

Earlier this week, I visited one of Paris‚Äô few longevity clinics dedicated to preventative medicine ‚Äî and the only one that describes itself as a tech startup.

Hidden behind an unassuming Haussmannian door, just a few minutes away from the Paris Opera, the centre has been operating for nine months. The startup behind it, Zoƒ´, promises customers a ‚Äú360-degree check-up‚Äô ‚Äî a three-hour series of tests and exams, ranging from blood tests to eye scans through spirometry and gut microbiome analyses.

The objective? Collect millions of data points on up to 200 biomarkers that are in turn analysed by an AI model, in order to deliver lifestyle recommendations that, promises Zoƒ´, will prevent disease and improve customers‚Äô long-term wellness.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about adding years of life, but rather life to years,‚Äù says Zoƒ´ cofounder ‚Äî and former special advisor to French president Emmanuel Macron ‚Äî Isma√´l Em√©lien. ‚ÄúThe goal is to learn the body‚Äôs ‚Äòuser manual‚Äô to prevent illnesses and enable people to live in good health for longer.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not for everyone. Membership to Zoƒ´ is ‚Ç¨3.6k per year, which includes an annual checkup as well as the follow-up recommendations. That‚Äôs roughly the cost of a membership to Soho House, says Zoƒ´'s CFO Antoine Attali ‚Äî and the startup's customers usually belong to the same social circles.

The clinic caters to premium needs, from snacks elaborated by world-famous chef Alain Ducasse to a balneotherapy section modelled on ‚ÄòJapanese thermal baths‚Äò, featuring a snow cabin (?) and a mineral bath that is, I am told, ‚Äútwice as salty as the Dead Sea‚Äù.

Attali tells me that in the long-term, Zoƒ´ hopes to become accessible to everyone, and that prices will go down to a similar level to your average WiFi subscription.

For now, though, preventative health remains a hobby of the upper-class. In fact, Zoƒ´'s investors are all private individuals; the company‚Äôs ‚Ç¨20m seed round, which it raised in 2022, included a good number of high-profile billionaires such as Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saad√© and Moderna CEO St√©phane Bancel.

And Zoƒ´ is not the only longevity startup appealing to the ultra-rich. Spotify founder Daniel Ek is behind similar ventures, including [Sand Clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-ek-spotify-sand-clinic-longevity-news), where customers can receive full body check-ups and treatments ranging from vacuum therapy to red light saunas ‚Äî with membership expected to cost between ‚Ç¨1,000 and ‚Ç¨10,000 a month.

Ek is also the founder of healthtech Neko Health, which has built a full-body scanner for health data collection that it says helps doctors detect potential diseases earlier. The company [has a clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/ek-neko-body-scanner-test) and has just opened a new spot in London, right in the middle of Marylebone, where it prices a one-hour scan at ¬£299 ‚Äî almost double the price of a visit to the Stockholm clinic when it opened in 2023 (‚Ç¨180).

Despite the cost, the proposition seems appealing enough. Neko Health says it already has a waiting list of 22k people; Zoƒ´ says it has ‚Äúaround 1k members‚Äù to date and is currently carrying out a dozen check-ups per day ‚Äî but the startup is confident that it can ramp up to reach its maximum capacity of 35k annual check-ups in the next five years.

Whether or not the preventative treatments promised by startups like Zoƒ´, Neko Health and Sand Clinic will ever reach the masses remains to be seen; what seems certain for now is that billionaires won‚Äôt get tired of full-body-scanning anytime soon.

Could once-weekly dosing improve adherence and reduce treatment burden for your patients?","UK-based healthtech Doccla has secured a ¬£35m Series B, led by European VC Lakestar, with new investors French VC Elaia and existing investors General Catalyst, Speedinvest and the investment leg of German media company Bertelsmann also participating.

Having almost quadrupled its annual revenue in 2023, it's planning its expansion in DACH and France, and says its German and French investors will help its international growth plans.

The startup, founded in 2019, makes ‚Äúvirtual ward‚Äù technology for healthcare providers. It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.

Doccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland‚Äôs Health Service Executive (HSE).

Doccla‚Äôs founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.

‚ÄúWith the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it‚Äôs a huge opportunity to scale,‚Äù says Ratz.

The virtual A&E

Sweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.

According to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.

Patients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.

So far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it‚Äôs adding 1k new patients every month.

‚ÄúOver time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,‚Äù Ratz says.

Partnering with pharma

Doccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).

‚ÄúWe have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,‚Äù Ratz says. ‚ÄúThis is because we are in very close contact with our patients.‚Äù

Doccla says it‚Äôs interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he‚Äôs seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.

With 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.

In one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.

‚ÄúWe can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits ‚Äî in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,‚Äù Ratz says.

Doccla has raised a total of ¬£52m to date.

In October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.",gpt-4o-mini,placeholder_id_4

TOPLINE:¬†
---------

Patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular events in the first month after a gout diagnosis that appears related to inflammation.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   Investigators analysed data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Database-GOLD and linked databases.
*   They conducted a cohort study among 76,440 patients with newly diagnosed gout and a self-controlled case series study among 4398 patients who had a cardiovascular event in the 2 years before or after gout diagnosis.
*   The main outcome was a first cardiovascular event (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischaemic attack).

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   In the cohort study, 3.9% of patients experienced a cardiovascular event in the 2 years after gout diagnosis.
*   The incidence of events was higher during days 1-30 postdiagnosis vs days 31-730 postdiagnosis (31.2 vs 21.6 events/1000 person-years).
*   In the self-controlled case series, the incidence was higher in the 30 days after gout diagnosis compared with the patient's own baseline period (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.55) and especially in the first 15 days (1.70).
*   Findings were similar regardless of age, comorbidities, and diuretic use, but the elevation of risk was greater for women than for men.
*   The association was largely attenuated when colchicine was prescribed the day of gout diagnosis (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.84) and somewhat attenuated when non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed that day (1.39).

IN PRACTICE:
------------

""First gout diagnosis was associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events in the short term. Inflammation during the first gout flare is the most plausible explanation for this association,"" the authors wrote. ""These findings support the need for cardiovascular risk management from the time of first gout consultation,"" they concluded.

Patients with acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) are less likely to have secondary vascular events when their clinicians test them for genetic variants conferring resistance to clopidogrel and tailor their antiplatelet therapy accordingly.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   Investigators conducted a systemic review and performed economic modelling to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of testing for CYP2C19 variants (loss-of-function alleles).
*   Analyses used data from 2 to 25 studies among patients with acute ischaemic stroke and/or TIA.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Relative to peers uniformly treated with clopidogrel, patients tested for genetic variants and treated accordingly had a non-significant halving of the risk for secondary vascular events (hazard ratios, 0.50 and 0.53).
*   Among patients found to have variants, ticagrelor netted a lower risk for secondary vascular events than clopidogrel (summary hazard ratio, 0.76).
*   Relative to peers without variants, patients with variants had elevated risk for secondary vascular events when treated with clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 1.72) but similar risk for bleeding.
*   The Genomadix Cube point-of-care test had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detecting variants when compared with laboratory tests.
*   Point-of-care tests varied in how often they failed to produce a usable test result; the rate ranged from 0.4% to 18.9% for the Genomadix Cube test.
*   A survey of UK laboratories indicated that the cost of a laboratory test ranged widely, from ¬£15 to ¬£250.
*   Relative to no testing, testing with either a laboratory test (usually requiring ~ 1 week) or a point-of-care test (usually requiring < 1 hour) was cost-saving and increased quality-adjusted life-years.

------------

""Our results suggest that CYP2C19 testing followed by tailored treatment is likely to be effective and cost-effective in both populations modelled (non-minor ischaemic stroke and TIA/minor ischaemic stroke)‚Ä¶,"" the authors wrote. ""There is some suggestion of reluctance by clinicians to act on pharmacogenetic variations.

One in five UK general practitioners (GPs) reported using generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in clinical practice, primarily to assist with administrative tasks and clinical reasoning, despite the absence of clear guidance.

METHODOLOGY:
----------------

*   An online survey was distributed to a non-probability sample of GPs registered with Doctors.net.uk.
*   A total of 1006 UK GPs responded to the survey, which was conducted from February 2 to February 22, 2024.
*   Participants were asked about their use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Google‚Äôs Bard in clinical practice.
*   The survey included questions on the specific tasks for which these tools were used, such as generating documentation and suggesting differential diagnoses.

Key findings include:
 - Average dietary fiber intake is only 18.3 g/day, significantly below the recommended 30 g/day.
 - Only 5.7% of older adults meet the fiber intake guidelines.
 - Factors influencing lower intake include:
   - Increasing age
   - Lack of natural teeth
   - Impaired chewing ability
   - Lower education levels
   - Poor general health
 - Common fiber sources are baked beans, bread, and potatoes, highlighting a preference for convenience foods.
 - Higher fiber consumption is linked to lower diastolic blood pressure, suggesting potential cardiovascular benefits.

Abstract

The UK population is living longer; therefore, promoting healthy ageing via positive nutrition could have widespread public health implications. Moreover, dietary fibre intake is associated with health benefits; however, intake is below UK recommendations (30 g/d). Utilising national dietary survey data can provide up-to-date information on a large representative cohort of UK older adults, so that tailored solutions can be developed in the future. This study used cross-sectional data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (years 2008‚Äì2009 to 2018‚Äì2019) for older adults‚Äô (n 1863; 65‚Äì96 years) dietary fibre intake (three-to-four-day food diaries), top ten dietary fibre-rich foods, associated factors (demographics, dietary/lifestyle habits) and various health outcomes (anthropometric, blood and urine). Mean dietary fibre intake was 18¬∑3 g/d (range: 2¬∑9‚Äì55¬∑1 g/d); therefore, below the UK dietary recommendations, with compliance at 5¬∑7 %. In addition, there were five significant associations (P < 0¬∑05) related to lower dietary fibre intake such as increasing age group, without own natural teeth, impaired chewing ability, lower education leaving age and poor general health. Older adults‚Äô key foods containing dietary fibre were mainly based on convenience such as baked beans, bread and potatoes. Positively, higher dietary fibre consumption was significantly associated (P = 0¬∑007) with reduced diastolic blood pressure. In summary, the benefits of dietary fibre consumption were identified in terms of health outcomes and oral health were key modulators of intake. Future work should focus on a life course approach and the role of food reformulation to help increase dietary fibre intake.

There are approximately 12 million older adults (aged 65 years and above) in the UK population, with one in ten at risk of malnutrition or considered malnourished; therefore, promoting healthy ageing could provide widespread benefits at both an individual and population level. Nutrition plays a key role in modulating health and well-being in the ageing population. More specifically, dietary fibre-rich diets are associated with lower risk from CVD, coronary events, stroke, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. Sufficient dietary fibre intake can also improve bowel function, quality of life and instrumental activities of daily living as well as having beneficial associations with certain aspects of cognitive function (such as digit symbol substitution test score) and skeletal muscle mass in older adults.

The dietary reference value for dietary fibre (quantitated by the Association of Analytical Chemists method) was increased to 30 g/d for UK adults (aged 19 years and over) in 2015. However, adherence to dietary fibre recommendations in the UK and globally is low. Therefore, it is important to put these values into context and understand how individuals can adhere to these 30 g/d recommendations. There are a number of strategies that will increase dietary fibre intake such as a consumption of a variety of fruits and vegetables, wholegrain cereals and high dietary fibre snacks (e.g. nuts and seeds) to comply with the recommendations. In the UK, dietary fibre intake in older adults is also well below the UK 30 g/d recommendations. Kehoe et al. reviewed older adults‚Äô dietary fibre intake in eighteen countries from National Nutrition surveys and reported mean intakes of between 15‚Äì26 g/d, demonstrating that all countries surveyed were below the target from a UK guideline perspective. There is an urgent need to increase the dietary fibre intake in the population, particularly in older adults to promote public health.

Understanding barriers to dietary fibre consumption in older populations is key to successful dietary modulation and behavioural change. Food accessibility, preparation and consumption challenges, coupled with health status, age-related changes, environment, social support, income and nutrition knowledge can contribute to insufficient dietary fibre intake in an ageing population. For example, oral health can be impacted by age often resulting in modulated food preferences favouring easy-to-chew foods; this may impact diet quality and variety as well as contribute to lower dietary fibre intake in an ageing population. Accordingly, food structure is a key consideration in ensuring age-appropriate foods. Unfortunately, dietary fibre-rich foods are often associated with negative textural attributes such as hard, fibrous, dry, sticky or adhesive, which are unlikely to improve or encourage consumption in an ageing population. In addition, there are various barriers associated with encouraging dietary fibre intake which need to be addressed including cost, low awareness of health benefits, confusion around intake requirements, inadequate food package labelling, limited product choice, unappealing sensory profile, difficulty in consumption, negative terms associated with high dietary fibre intake (e.g. stodgy and bloating) and cooking constraints. Going forward, overcoming such barriers will be key to promoting dietary fibre-rich diets.

Consideration of compliance to dietary fibre requirements is often overshadowed by other nutrients such as sugar, saturated fat and salt, highlighting the need for greater awareness and research into promoting dietary fibre intake, especially in an ageing population. This paper aims to understand (1) what proportion of the ageing UK population meets dietary fibre intake recommendations; (2) what dietary fibre-rich foods are typically consumed by older adults; and (3) what factors are associated with consuming dietary fibre-rich foods in UK older adults, by using the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) (years 2008‚Äì2009 to 2018‚Äì2019) data, which includes a large representative cohort of UK older adults. These data will inform future strategies to enable an increase in dietary fibre intake within an older-aged population.

Methods

National diet and nutrition survey

The NDNS is an ongoing national cross-sectional survey focusing on food consumption, nutrient intake and nutritional status in a representative UK population (aged 1¬∑5 years and above) based on private households. In brief, invited individuals were selected at random (via the postcode address file) to ensure the data were a representative cohort of the UK population. The survey data collection centred around three aspects: (1) demographic and lifestyle questionnaires; (2) three-to-four-day unweighted food diary; and (3) obtaining physical measures of anthropometric outcomes, blood and urine samples. All individuals provided informed consent and it was ensured that data would be collected in accordance with relevant data protection legislation as well as confidentiality being maintained at all times. Ethical approval was granted from the corresponding ethical committees.

Study population

Adults aged 65 years and over (commonly referred to as older adults in the UK and globally) were selected for analysis. Using years 2008‚Äì2009 to 2018‚Äì2019 from the NDNS resulted in a sample size of 1863 older adults (age range: 65‚Äì96 years; 42 % male and 58 % female).

Dietary, anthropometric and biochemical measures

In brief, individuals were suitably trained and asked to complete an unweighted three-to-four-day food diary to record all food and drink consumed (including time, company, eating location, food and drink description, brand names, portion sizes and dishes consumed at home and eating out). The data were subsequently coded and integrated into the Diet In Nutrients Out system, and analysis was based on the NDNS Nutrient Databank. The following measurements: height, weight, spot urine sample, blood pressure, non-fasting/fasting blood sample were also collected by a qualified nurse using validated approaches. For the purpose of this paper, the focus was on dietary fibre which was based on the Association of Analytical Chemists method. It should be noted some survey years have been retrospectively adjusted so that all data were reported using the Association of Analytical Chemists method.

In addition, factors that can modulate food intake such as demographic characteristics, lifestyle preferences and dietary habits were captured during the initial interview stage. Individuals‚Äô height and weight were also recorded so that BMI was subsequently calculated. Potential factors that older adults may encounter in terms of consuming sufficient dietary fibre intake were explored: (1) household income (less than ¬£5000 to more than ¬£100¬†000); (2) ethnicity (white, mixed ethnic group, black or black British, Asian or Asian British or any other group); (3) residence region (England: North, South, Central/Midlands, Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland); (4) survey year (2008‚Äì2009 to 2018‚Äì2019); (5) fruit and vegetable shopping frequency (more than once a day to less often than every two months); (6) fruit and vegetable shopping location (large supermarket to spontaneous); (7) food avoidance (yes vs. no); (8) overall health (very bad to very good); (9) medication use (yes vs. no); (10) own natural teeth (yes vs. no); (11) denture use (yes vs. no); (12) smoking (yes vs. no); (13) chewing ability (no difficulty to great amount of difficulty); (14) education leaving age (14 years or under to 19 years or over); (15) food type (soft/mashed foods to liquids); and (16) health outcomes (physical activity level, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TAG, total cholesterol and glucose) were all assessed and added as covariates in the analysis.

Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis was performed using Stata software (version 17¬∑0, StataCorp LP, USA). The data were analysed as a survey; therefore, sampling weights (e.g. reduced sampling-related bias by taking into account the numbers of individuals within each strata) for each year of analysis (2008‚Äì2009 to 2018‚Äì2019) were applied. The individual-level sampling weights (as recommended by NDNS) were applied for the analysis on the association of dietary fibre consumption with demographic characteristics and types of foods consumed as well as the association of dietary fibre intake with anthropometric measures and health outcomes. The data are presented as means with se. It should be noted that for some variables (such as physical activity, BMI, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and blood analytes), data were not available for all 1863 older adults. Accordingly, this was adjusted in the analysis (by removing the observations with missing values) using the ‚ÄòSVY command‚Äô in Stata. In addition, linear regression was used to assess the association of dietary fibre consumption with demographic characteristics and health outcomes. More specifically, the analysis was conducted using three models: (1) model one compared the outcomes of interest (fruit and vegetable shopping frequency and location, food avoidance, overall health, medication use, own natural teeth, denture use, chewing ability, education leaving age and food type) with dietary fibre and analysis was controlled for energy (bivariate analysis); (2) model two compared outcomes of interest in model one with age and sex added as covariates (multivariate analysis); and (3) model three was an analysis of model two with additional covariates (household income, residence region, survey year and ethnicity) (multivariate analysis). The health outcomes of interest (physical activity, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TAG, total cholesterol and glucose) utilised the same three models described above in our regression analysis. For all analyses P < 0¬∑05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

The majority of the older adult cohort were aged between 65‚Äì74 years (57¬∑1 %), resident in England (59¬∑4 %), white British (97¬∑4 %) and typically shopping for fruit/vegetables at large supermarkets (76¬∑9 %) (Table S1). Older adults‚Äô mean consumption of dietary fibre was 18¬∑3 g/d (range: 2¬∑9‚Äì55¬∑1 g/d); only 5¬∑7 % of this population (n 107/1863) adhered to the current UK recommendations utilising average dietary fibre intake over a three-to-four-day period. There was a significant association (P = 0¬∑02) for age group, with increasing age resulting in lower dietary fibre consumption (multivariate: ‚Äì0¬∑78 ¬± 0¬∑33). The extent of sex-related associations was also modulated by analysis. Males consumed significantly more dietary fibre than females in the bivariate analysis (P = 0¬∑01); however, this significant association was reduced in the multivariate analysis.

There was a significant association (P < 0¬∑0001) with dentition, where older adults with their own natural teeth consumed more dietary fibre than individuals without their own natural teeth. Similarly, older adults that reported impaired chewing ability had significantly lower dietary fibre intake (P = 0¬∑003) compared with individuals with no chewing difficulty. There was also a tendency for an association (P = 0¬∑08) with denture use, with those who used dentures consuming less dietary fibre compared with non-denture users. The education leaving age had a significant impact on dietary fibre intake (P < 0¬∑0001) where finishing school at a higher age was associated with increased dietary fibre intake. General health status was significantly associated (P = 0¬∑001) with dietary fibre consumption where older adults that reported poorer general health had significantly lower dietary fibre intake. The remaining factors (such as household income, medication, smoking, fruit/vegetable shopping frequency and food avoidance) had no significant association with dietary fibre intake. However, it should be noted that all factors (apart from fruit and vegetable shopping location; P = 0¬∑30) resulted in a significant association in the bivariate analysis; hence, included in subsequent multivariate analysis.

Older adults consumed the largest quantity of dietary fibre from baked beans, regardless of age and sex. Overall, bread and potatoes were the most frequently consumed dietary fibre-rich foods within this population. In addition, mean fruit and vegetable consumption was 121¬∑1 g/d (range: 0¬∑0‚Äì738¬∑3 g/d) and just 24 % of older adults (n 448/1863) met the five-a-day recommendations.

BMI was significantly associated with dietary fibre intake (bivariate: 0¬∑04 ¬± 0¬∑01; P = 0¬∑003) where an increase in BMI resulted in higher dietary fibre consumption; however, this association was reduced in the multivariate analysis (multivariate: 0¬∑003 ¬± 0¬∑03; P = 0¬∑19). This was also the case for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (bivariate: 1¬∑05 ¬± 0¬∑43; P = 0¬∑02 vs. multivariate: 0¬∑74 ¬± 0¬∑74; P = 0¬∑32). Similarly, higher dietary fibre intake was significantly associated (bivariate: ‚Äì0¬∑69 ¬± 0¬∑36; P = 0¬∑05) with lower TAG; yet this effect was lost after multivariate analysis (model three: ‚àí0¬∑89 ¬± 0¬∑63; P = 0¬∑16). It should be noted that only diastolic blood pressure was significantly associated (P = 0¬∑007) with dietary fibre intake in all analyses; higher dietary fibre intake was associated with a lower diastolic blood pressure (‚Äì0¬∑08 ¬± 0¬∑03). Due to the lack of significant association between physical activity level, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol and glucose in the bivariate analysis, these outcomes were not included in subsequent analysis.

Discussion

The mean dietary fibre intake of UK older adults was 18¬∑3 g/d (range: 2¬∑9‚Äì55¬∑1 g/d) which was only 61 % of the current UK dietary reference value. This finding was not unexpected since data from eighteen European countries National Nutrition surveys also identified older adults‚Äô dietary fibre intake was typically below target (15‚Äì26 g/d). However, Kehoe et al. did not split older adults by increasing age groups; accordingly, age-related differences in intake within an ageing population may have been overlooked. Therefore, to address such a limitation our analyses grouped older adults into three groups: (1) young-old (aged 65‚Äì74 years); (2) old-old (aged 75‚Äì84 years); and (3) oldest-old (aged 85+ years). It was evident that our older adult cohort (75+ years) consumed less dietary fibre than their younger counterparts (65‚Äì74 years); this suggests the importance of recruiting sufficient older adults across the different age groups especially as the impact of age-related changes are likely to be greater with increasing age. Moreover, it is important to understand adherence to guidelines within the population; our analysis demonstrated that only 107 from 1863 older adults adhered to current guidelines (using average dietary fibre intake over three-to-four-day period). However, it should be noted this is similar in the general adult population (19‚Äì64 years) for dietary fibre. For example, Scheelbeek et al. noted approximately 7 % of the UK population met dietary fibre-related guidelines (Eatwell Guide). In addition, modelling related studies have demonstrated a small increase in dietary fibre intake (2¬∑2 g/d) due to dietary fibre enrichment which could have widespread public implications. Additionally, it is useful to investigate the role of various demographics on subsequent dietary fibre intake. Overall, basic demographics (such as household income, residence region, ethnicity and survey year) had no significant impact on dietary fibre consumption in this older adult cohort. Furthermore, a recent review highlighted the impact of diversity (e.g. background and health conditions) within this age group; this could be a possible reason for inconsistency in reporting associations between such demographics compared with other age groups as well as methodology differences in grouping individuals. However, it should be noted that education leaving age had a noteworthy effect on dietary fibre. For example, higher education achievement resulted in higher dietary fibre intake; similar findings have been present in the literature where lower education led to lower dietary fibre intake and diet quality. Therefore, this suggests more emphasis on a life course approach to dietary fibre and the role of food reformulation to help increase dietary fibre intake.

It is important to understand the relevant challenges associated with older adults‚Äô dietary fibre intake so that targeted strategies to promote intake can be subsequently identified. For example, oral health can decline with age (such as teeth loss, chewing problems and lower bite force); thereby, negatively impacting dietary fibre intake (e.g. modulating food preferences and cooking preparation) within an ageing population. Such findings were evident in our older adult cohort where individuals with poor chewing ability and without their own natural teeth tended to consume less dietary fibre. This suggests older adults with oral health impairments food preferences and diet quality are also influenced implying tailored advice with relevant substitutions would be helpful for this population. Therefore, developing targeted strategies to meet older adults‚Äô needs (including understanding relevant changes in oral processing behaviours with increasing age) would be suggested to overcome associated barriers and subsequently help reduce the widespread deficit in dietary fibre intake.

The top ten foods that contributed to older adults‚Äô dietary fibre were compiled so that trends could be identified and areas of focus highlighted. The key dietary fibre-rich foods in terms of largest amount of dietary fibre and most commonly consumed were baked beans, bread and potatoes; suggesting convenience and foods requiring minimal effort was a key driver of food choice in this population. It is likely age-related changes could be a contributing factor resulting in preference for simple, easy/quick to prepare and convenience foods. Moreover, Nakano and Washizu noted the shift in perceptions of convenience foods, and this could have a role in supporting healthy eating in an ageing population. In addition, convenience and easy access to food are considered to promote food intake and a key motivator in food choice; accordingly, this emphasises the importance of positive environmental cues on subsequent intake. Going forward, improving fruit and vegetable consumption in this population would be recommended; in addition, this should have a noteworthy impact on dietary fibre consumption. However, it is not without its challenges such as concerns over food wastage (e.g. vegetable packet size too large in some cases), requiring regular shopping, cost implications, cooking skills and living alone. Accordingly, this indicates the importance of making dietary fibre-rich foods accessible to all to reduce consumption-related barriers.

The health benefits of dietary fibre consumption are well-recognised such as reduction in CVD, coronary events, stroke, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer risk. However, it is important to put such findings into context by investigating various health outcomes within our older adult cohort. General health (via self-reported measures) was related with higher dietary fibre intake as such highlighting that individuals identifying as healthier consumed more dietary fibre and clearly demonstrating the benefits of dietary fibre consumption. Moreover, it is important to understand whether perceived health can be explained by differences in relevant health markers. Most anthropometric and biochemical measures including BMI, physical activity level, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, TAG and glucose were not significantly associated with dietary fibre intake. However, there was a beneficial association between diastolic blood pressure and dietary fibre intake, where higher dietary fibre intake was associated with a lower diastolic blood pressure. If an older adult meets the dietary fibre 30 g/d recommendations, this was associated with a 2¬∑5 mmHg lower diastolic blood pressure, which was clinically significant on a population scale. Cook et al. noted that a 2¬∑0 mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure could decrease hypertension prevalence as well as CHD and stroke risk. Therefore, developing easy to implement and accessible dietary fibre-related strategies for all is a key going forward.

The strength of the analysis is that the NDNS data include a representative cohort of UK older adults. However, it should be noted that such analysis is associated with various methodology challenges and potential limitations: (1) NDNS is a cross-sectional survey and identifies associations rather than causation and (2) potential bias may be linked with self-reported dietary intakes and potential underreporting. In addition, the older adult cohort was mainly between 65‚Äì74 years old and 65 % of the cohort rated their general health either as good or very good. Therefore, going forward capturing adults in the oldest age group (85+ years) and more valuable health categories as well as underrepresented ethnic groups could provide additional age-related insights as dietary fibre intake may differ in such groups.

Conclusion

This cross-sectional analysis observed that older adults‚Äô dietary fibre intake was substantially below UK recommendations. Five key contributing factors (increasing age group, without own natural teeth, impaired chewing ability, lower education leaving age and poor general health) had a notable impact on subsequent dietary fibre intake. In addition, the role of easy-to-eat foods in older adults‚Äô food choice should not be underestimated as baked beans, bread and potatoes were identified as key foods containing dietary fibre. Accordingly, promoting fruit and vegetables could lead to an uplift in dietary fibre consumption; however, any suggested foods also need to be tailored to the needs of this population (such as oral health impairments). Moreover, the beneficial association between health and dietary fibre (such as reduction in diastolic blood pressure and self-reported good general health) is noteworthy. This highlights the importance of increasing dietary fibre prior to entering the ‚Äòolder adults‚Äô stage should be a key public health priority.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

A higher desire to quit smoking is associated with higher smoking abstinence rates; however, the effectiveness of an opt-out treatment for tobacco use is not diminished even when individuals express lower initial desire to quit smoking.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Researchers conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial to check if the effectiveness of an opt-out treatment program diminished in participants with a lower initial desire to quit smoking.
*   They included 739 participants (mean age, 51.4 years; 47.2% women) who were hospitalized smokers. Participants were randomly assigned to either a group that received quitting smoking materials that they would not receive if they actively opted out or an opt-in group, in which people only received materials if they selected help.
*   Treatment included nicotine replacement therapy, prescriptions for post-discharge medications, a 2-week medication starter kit, treatment planning, and four outpatient counseling calls.
*   Participants were instructed to indicate their initial readiness to quit smoking on a scale of 0-10, with 0 representing no thoughts about quitting and 10 representing active efforts to quit.
*   The association of the desire to quit smoking and its interaction with the treatment group at 1-month follow-up was assessed.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   A higher desire to quit smoking was associated with higher smoking abstinence rates in the overall population.
*   The abstinence rate for smoking was 32% (95% CI, 25%-40%) in participants with level 10 desire to quit smoking in the opt-out group.
*   In participants with level 0 desire to quit smoking, the smoking abstinence rate was at 8% (95% CI, 3%-16%) in the opt-out group.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""These findings may inform clinical decision-making. Even though people with a lower desire to quit had lower quit rates, the advantage of opt-out treatment was constant,"" the authors wrote.

**SOURCE:**
-----------

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

This study was limited to people who were hospitalized and smoked from a Midwestern hospital. The follow-up duration was only for 1 month.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The study was supported by grants from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health; and other sources. The authors reported no conflicts of interest.

Demand for NHS Talking Therapies has reached an all-time high. The service received 1.82 million referrals in 2023/24. This is slightly higher than 2021/2022, and more than double the 884,000 received in 2012/13.

As more people come forward for help, the NHS is looking to use NICE-recommended digital therapies to help increase the support available.

**Figure 1: Record number of referrals to NHS Talking Therapies**

**Referrals received, by financial year.**

NHS Talking Therapies offer NICE-recommended psychological therapies for adults with common mental health conditions such as depression, stress, social anxiety, phobias or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some programmes extend their support to young people aged 16 and 17.

‚ÄúCOVID had a big impact,‚Äù said Sarah Watts, Clinical Lead for Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent NHS Talking Therapies. ‚ÄúThe good thing is that more people are coming forward. People are recognising that they need therapy and support, and they are asking for it.‚Äù

We recommend 7 digitally enabled therapies to treat depression and anxiety disorders in adults. The technologies can be used in NHS Talking Therapies while more evidence is generated on their clinical and cost-effectiveness.

Our rapid assessments compared the digital technologies to traditional face-to-face therapy. According to these figures, digitally enabled therapies for anxiety disorders could potentially save around 6,000 therapist hours per 1,000 people in NHS Talking Therapies in England. For depression technologies, approximately 6,800 therapist hours could be saved.

Evidence from current practice provided by NHS England and analysed by us indicates that digital therapies recommended for PTSD could save over 5,000 hours of therapist time per 1,000 people. Almost 2,500 therapist hours per 1,000 people could be saved for social anxiety disorders, and 600 for depression.

**Figure 2: Estimated therapist time that could be saved by NICE-recommended digital therapies for social anxiety, PTSD, and depression**

The actual number of hours saved will depend on the proportion of patients who opt to use digital therapies.

These technologies can be accessed online or through apps and include materials based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). They must be used with support from a trained practitioner or therapist, who monitors progress, risks, and outcomes. Some of these therapies are already in use in the NHS.

Ms Rebecca Morley, specialist committee member and team manager at NHS North Yorkshire Talking Therapies said: ‚ÄúWe consider digital inequalities in terms of accessibility. Clinicians can offer technological support to help patients either enter digitally enabled therapies or maintain them, depending on their needs.‚Äù

‚ÄúA digital therapy is an additional tool in the toolbox that will be appropriate for some people,‚Äù said Ms Watts. ‚ÄúPatient choice is absolutely key.‚Äù

> Improving access to mental health care is a top priority for the NHS. The pandemic led to rising pressures, with more people than ever before now in contact with mental health services. NICE-recommended digital therapies can increase the support available to people where appropriate, alongside therapists, and help NHS staff to provide care in a flexible and timely manner.

The future of digital mental health

NICE also recommends 4 digital technologies that can help children and young people with feelings of anxiety or low mood, and another 4 technologies for people with psychosis: 3 digital therapies to help manage symptoms or prevent relapse in adults, and a virtual reality (VR) technology to treat severe agoraphobia in those over 16. They are Early Value Assessments and can be used while more data is being collected on their clinical and cost-effectiveness.

‚ÄúDigital mental health over the next decade will embrace new technologies including artificial intelligence, wearables, and extended reality,‚Äù said Professor Chris Hollis, specialist committee member and Chair of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Digital Mental Health at the University of Nottingham. ‚ÄúThere will be a greater shift to prevention and early intervention.‚Äù

Dr Maria Loades, specialist committee member and Clinical Psychologist at the University of Bath noted: ‚ÄúWe need to be open-minded to these innovations. We need to ensure that choice and flexibility remain in the system, and that human support is available where it is needed and in a timely manner.‚Äù

> Mental health services are facing record demand, and these digitally enabled therapies can help the NHS get support to more people faster.
> 
> Our rapid assessments show they have promise and the additional evidence collected during this period will help us make sure that they are clinically effective and represent good value for money for the taxpayer. This guidance underscores NICE‚Äôs commitment to focusing on what matters most to people and the health and care system.

Notes:

*   There was not sufficient data available to calculate savings for generalised anxiety or body dysmorphic disorder.
    
*   All technologies will need Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC) approval before they can be adopted by the NHS. They will also require an NHS Talking Therapies Digitally Enabled Therapy assessment from NHS England, and CE or UKCA mark approval.",gpt-4o-mini,placeholder_id_1

Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a rare genetic condition caused by a mutation in the VHL gene. This gene produces a protein that controls cell growth, and a mutation in this gene can cause cells to grow abnormally. This can lead to cysts or tumours developing in different parts of the body, such as the kidneys, brain and pancreas that can impair function or become cancerous.

Evidence shows belzutifan can reduce tumour size or prevent them from getting bigger and prevent the loss of organ function that people experience from repeated tumours and surgeries.

VHL varies from person to person and although some people might only develop 1 or a few tumours in their whole life, others might have multiple tumours in different (or the same) organs. There are only about 600 adults in England living with the condition.

NICE is looking at belzutifan for adults who need treatment for VHL-associated kidney, central nervous system or pancreatic tumours.

This condition severely affects the quality of life of people who are living with it, as well as their families and carers.

There are no medicines that are currently recommended by NICE that address the underlying causes of this condition and surgery is the main treatment option for removing tumours and cysts.

This is a new treatment that has the potential to prevent loss of organ function from repeated tumours and surgeries and improve people‚Äôs quality of life at a price that is good value for the taxpayer. We‚Äôre therefore pleased to be able to recommend it today while more evidence is collected.

The committee heard from patient experts who explained that for some people there are a wide variety of debilitating symptoms depending on where the tumours are growing in the body. These include constant pain, loss of balance and motor skills, loss of vision, breathlessness, coughing, headaches, confusion, severe nausea and fatigue.

Evidence from a small study suggests that belzutifan reduces tumour size and gives people longer before their condition gets worse. However there are some uncertainties and more evidence is needed before it can be considered for routine use on the NHS, so it is recommended for use with further data collection; known as managed access.

Managed access gives people faster access to promising new treatments that might not be recommended because of uncertainties about their clinical or cost effectiveness. During managed access, more evidence is collected to address any uncertainties about a treatment and NICE then uses this evidence to assess whether the treatment should be made available for routine use on the NHS.",gpt-4o-mini,placeholder_id_2

The kits would be used help those with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency to treat and avoid an adrenal crisis and the need to go to hospital for emergency treatment.

The recommendation is included in a new clinical guideline on identifying and managing adrenal insufficiency in people of all ages, published by NICE today (Wednesday, 28 August).

Adrenal insufficiency occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough essential hormones ‚Äì particularly cortisol and aldosterone.

The recommendation details the standard equipment and information that would be contained in each proposed kit, including an intramuscular hydrocortisone injections, syringes, and needles.

The guideline also recommends that training on how and when to use the kits should be given to people with the condition, close family members and carers. The guideline reminds people with adrenal insufficiency to increase tablet glucocorticoid doses if they are unwell, and to call 999 or attend an emergency department if they become unwell and think they are developing an adrenal crisis.

In 2022-23 there were 1,220 hospital admissions for adrenal crisis. An adrenal crisis occurs when the levels of cortisol in a person‚Äôs body fall significantly. It is a medical emergency and if left untreated it can be fatal.

> This useful and useable guideline will help to ensure high quality care is offered to people with this condition and support them, their families and carers to make informed decisions about their treatment and long-term care.
> 
> Most people with adrenal insufficiency live active lives with few limitations. Our guideline will help them manage the condition effectively and keep themselves safe

Chloe Mezzetti, who lives with Addison‚Äôs disease and was a lay member of NICE‚Äôs guideline committee, said: ‚ÄúThese valuable guidelines will help shape the standard of care and improve patient safety for people living with Addison's and adrenal insufficiency. I have truly enjoyed my role as a lay member and contributing to these guidelines by sharing my lived experience.""

> After diagnosis, an emergency hydrocortisone injection kit should always be prescribed and explained to new patients to prevent a potentially fatal adrenal crisis. Due to being a rare condition, this has not always been the case for our community. It is fantastic these affordable and widely available emergency injection kits are one of the new recommendations in the NICE guidelines ‚Äì saving lives. I always carry my injection kit in my bag, and I also have a backup kit which I keep in my car.

The guideline aims to help healthcare professionals spot symptoms earlier and manage the condition effectively.

The guideline recommends that healthcare professionals:

*   Consider adrenal insufficiency in people with an unexplained increase in darkened patches of skin (hyperpigmentation) or when there is no other clinical explanation for the presence of persistent symptoms such as weight loss, nausea or vomiting and lack of appetite.
    
*   Offer a serum cortisol test between 8am and 9am to people aged one year and over with suspected adrenal insufficiency to help diagnose the condition. The test needs to be administered at this time because this is when cortisol levels peak and the results are most accurate.
    

Treatment for adrenal insufficiency usually involves corticosteroid (steroid) replacement therapy for life and the guideline stresses the importance of glucocorticoid as an essential hormone replacement and lifesaving treatment for adrenal crisis.

Adrenal insufficiency can be a life-threatening condition, as it leaves people unable to produce higher levels of cortisol when they face illness, are having an operation or during childbirth. Without this increase in cortisol, the body can go into an adrenal crisis, leading to low blood pressure, coma and, if untreated, death.

It is estimated that between 5,700 and 7,900 people in England have primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison‚Äôs Disease) and between 8,500 and 15,800 people have the more common secondary adrenal insufficiency.

- Lecanemab, licensed for slowing progression in mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, shows a delay of cognitive decline by just 4 to 6 months.
- The treatment requires fortnightly hospital infusions and intensive monitoring for side effects, raising significant costs.
- NICE's independent committee emphasizes that any recommended treatment must provide substantial benefits while being a good use of taxpayer resources.
- Approximately 70,000 adults in England could have been eligible for this treatment, highlighting the potential impact on healthcare resources.

 - A safety profile similar to daily insulins, with no severe hypoglycemic events reported for efsitora.

Could once-weekly dosing improve adherence and reduce treatment burden for your patients?","The benefits of the new Alzheimer‚Äôs drug lecanemab are too small to justify the costs, NICE said in draft guidance published today.

Lecanemab (also called Leqembi and made by Eisai) is for slowing progression in mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) in adults and has been licensed by The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) today.

It is the first medicine to be licensed for Great Britain that has been shown to slow down progression of the disease, by between 4 and 6 months, NICE's independent committee heard.

However, the costs of providing the treatment, including fortnightly infusions in hospital and intensive monitoring for side effects, combined with the relatively small benefits it provides to patients means it cannot be considered good value for the taxpayer, the independent NICE committee has said.

Today we issued draft guidance for consultation not recommending lecanemab for use on the NHS because it is not a cost effective use of limited NHS funding. The independent NICE committee examined the available research trial evidence, real world data, and heard from patient representatives and their carers.

> This is a new and emerging field of medicine which will no doubt develop rapidly. However, the reality is that the benefits this first treatment provides are just too small to justify the significant cost to the NHS. It is an intensive treatment to give to patients involving a hospital visit every two weeks with skilled staff needed to monitor them for signs of serious side effects, plus the cost of purchasing the drug.
> 
> Our independent committee has rigorously evaluated the available evidence, including the benefit for carers but NICE must only recommend treatments that offer good value to the taxpayer.

From the clinical trial evidence lecanemab has a small but meaningful - 4 to 6 months - effect on delaying cognitive decline when added to existing treatment.

And because the clinical trial only reported outcomes when people had been taking lecanemab for 18 months there is a lack of evidence on its long-term effects.

> Lecanemab and other similar treatments for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease now coming on stream have prompted a great deal of debate about the prospects of being able for the first time to slow the effects of a condition that is progressive, life-limiting, complex and distressing.
> 
> For NICE to be able to approve a medicine for use in the NHS it must not only provide benefits to patients, but it must also represent a good use of NHS resources and taxpayers‚Äô money.
> 
> Lecanemab provides on average 4 to 6 months slowing in the rate of progression from mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, but this is just not enough benefit to justify the additional cost to the NHS.

It is estimated around 70,000 adults in England would have been eligible for treatment with lecanemab.

The [public consultation on the draft NICE guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-ta11220/consultation/html-content-4) will close on Friday 20 September 2024. The independent committee will consider all responses at a second committee meeting later in the year before producing its final recommendations.",gpt-4o-mini,placeholder_id_4
2024-08-14,2024-09-23 04:12:37,"üåü A new era in managing uterine fibroids is here with linzagolix (Yselty)! This once-daily tablet offers a promising option for women suffering from moderate to severe symptoms. 

Key insights on linzagolix:  
- MECHANISM: As a GnRH antagonist, it reduces hormone release, effectively decreasing bleeding and shrinking fibroids.  
- LONG-TERM USE: Recommended for treatment over 6 months, making it suitable for ongoing management rather than short-term solutions.  
- FLEXIBILITY: Can be taken with or without hormonal add-back therapy (ABT), allowing for personalized treatment plans.  

Uterine fibroids affect approximately 66% of women, with 33% experiencing debilitating symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain. Left untreated, these can lead to infertility and significantly impact quality of life.  

Linzagolix not only addresses symptoms but also empowers clinicians to tailor care for their patients.

Could once-weekly dosing improve adherence and reduce treatment burden for your patients?","Thousands could benefit from new option for treating symptoms of uterine fibroids

Taken once a day as a single tablet, linzagolix (which is also called Yselty and made by Theramex) is a type of treatment called a GnRH antagonist. It has been shown to be effective in reducing the bleeding caused by uterine fibroids, and also shrinking the fibroids themselves, compared with a dummy treatment. It works by reducing the release of hormones which control oestrogen and progesterone production by the ovaries.

Linzagolix is recommended for use as a longer-term treatment (more than 6 months) and is not for people who need short-term treatment, for example, before planned uterine fibroid surgery. It can also be taken with or without hormonal add-back therapy (ABT). ABT involves taking a low dose of hormones at the same time as a GnRH antagonist to give the body enough hormones to protect bones and control any possible side effects.

> I am pleased we have been able to recommend a further treatment option for managing moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids.
> 
> Uterine fibroids can have many debilitating symptoms including pain and heavy menstrual bleeding. If left untreated they can lead to infertility and have a substantial effect on quality of life.
> 
> Linzagolix offers greater flexibility as it can be taken either with or without hormone therapy and means clinicians can provide more personalised care in the treatment of this often debilitating condition.

Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in or around the uterus (womb). Their exact cause is not known but they have been linked to oestrogen and progesterone. Around 66% of women develop at least 1 uterine fibroid during their lifetime and 33% of women will develop symptoms from uterine fibroids.

Most fibroids are small and do not cause symptoms. However, some people with fibroids develop symptoms that can include very heavy or long menstrual periods or pelvic pressure or pain. People with moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids can experience a substantial negative effect on their quality of life.

Usual treatment for moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids includes hormonal treatments, such as GnRH receptor agonists and antagonists, and supportive care.",gpt-4o-mini,placeholder_id_0

Key highlights:
- ELRANATAMAB AND TECLISTAMAB: Both immunotherapies are now under consultation, with elranatamab open until August 9, 2024, and teclistamab until August 13, 2024. These treatments redirect T-cells to target and destroy multiple myeloma cells, administered via subcutaneous injection.
- OPTIMIZED RECOMMENDATIONS: These treatments are approved with modifications, specifically for patients who have undergone at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody.
- ISATUXIMAB NOT RECOMMENDED: The independent committee could not endorse isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone due to cost-effectiveness concerns, despite its previous entry into the Cancer Drugs Fund.

Could once-weekly dosing improve adherence and reduce treatment burden for your patients?","In total we‚Äôve now made 14 positive recommendations for multiple myeloma treatments in the past 5 years.

Positive recommendations for elranatamab are open for consultation until 9 August 2024 and teclistamab until 13 August 2024. Teclistamab and elranatamab are immunotherapies that work by redirecting T-cells to multiple myeloma cells and helping to destroy them. Both are given by injection under the skin.

The recommendations are ‚Äòoptimised‚Äô which means the treatments were approved with some modifications to the population the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency licence covers.

The draft guidance for elranatamab replaces the final draft guidance published on 21 June 2024 which was withdrawn to allow consultation on the optimised recommendation.

**Why ‚Äòoptimised‚Äô?**

Elranatamab and teclistamab sit in a similar place in the treatment pathway to each other and have the same indication wording in their marketing authorisations (MA):

‚Äòa monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least 3 prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy‚Äô.

Because both companies (Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, respectively) only compared their treatments with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone, our draft recommendation for both treatments is that they should be limited to the population that would be eligible for pomalidomide plus dexamethasone at this stage in the pathway.

People who have already been treated with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone earlier in their treatment pathway would not therefore be eligible under these draft recommendations.

**Not recommended**

We were not able to make a positive recommendation for isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (IsaPD) for people with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have already been treated with lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.

Our independent committee found that the cost of the drug in relation to the size of the benefits is considerably higher than what is considered an acceptable use of NHS resources.

This decision follows a review of TA 658 which recommended IsaPD for entry into the Cancer Drugs Fund - a funding arrangement that allowed its use in the NHS while more evidence about its potential clinical and cost effectiveness was collected.

We have received 2 appeals against this final draft guidance which will be heard on 23 September.

People will still be able to start IsaPD treatment until final guidance is published after the resolution of the appeal. When final guidance is published, whatever the recommendation, people already on this treatment will be able to continue it until they and their NHS healthcare professional consider it appropriate to stop.

Alternative treatment options for people eligible for isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone are daratumumab monotherapy or pomalidomide and dexamethasone.

IsaPD sits in a similar place in the treatment pathway, but different previous treatments means that different people may be eligible for isatuximab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone than are eligible for elranatamab and teclistimab.

Funding

As there is a positive draft recommendation for managed access in the relevant population, interim funding is available for anyone eligible for elranatamab under this recommendation.

Again, because there is a draft recommendation for routine commissioning in place, interim funding is available for people eligible for teclistimab.",gpt-4o-mini,placeholder_id_1
