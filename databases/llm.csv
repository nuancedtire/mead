- *AKI history doubles the risk of developing dementia,* drawing attention to the need for early monitoring.
- This study followed over 305,000 individuals aged 65+ in Stockholm, uncovering 47,938 cases of dementia over 12 years.
- Notably, AKI increased the occurrence of Lewy body dementia (DLB) by 88%, vascular dementia by 47%, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) by 31%. 
- Severe AKI linked to hospitalization poses a **61%** higher risk than less severe cases. 
- A dose-response relationship exists between the severity of AKI and dementia risk, reinforcing the need for comprehensive prevention strategies.  
- Age stratification revealed a staggering **four-fold increase in DLB and PDD risk** for those over 85 years.

These insights emphasize the importance of monitoring kidney function as part of dementia prevention strategies. Let's discuss how this can be integrated into clinical practice!

_Study:¬†[Acute Kidney Injury and Its Association With Dementia and Specific Dementia Types: Findings From a Population-Based Study in Sweden.](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209751) Image Credit: crystal light / Shutterstock.com_

A recent study published in the journal¬†_[Neurology](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209751)_ examines the association between dementia risk and a prior history of acute kidney injury (AKI).

AKI and dementia
----------------

Dementia is a condition in which cognitive function declines progressively, thereby impacting the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). In 2019, about 55 million people were estimated to be affected by dementia.

Dementia is an incurable and progressive condition that requires active and comprehensive prevention strategies to reduce the public health burden and costs associated with its management. Several factors increase the risk of developing dementia, some of which include lower educational status, traumatic brain injury, midlife hypertension or obesity, diabetes, drinking, smoking, depression and social isolation, air pollution, and physical inactivity.

Like dementia, AKI increases the risk of adverse health outcomes, including death due to the development of heart and renal failure.

Preclinical studies indicate that AKI increases dementia risk. This association may involve multiple mechanisms, such as cerebrovascular pathology, autonomic dysfunction, abnormally low neurotransmitter levels, and neuroinflammation.

About the study
---------------

The current study involved 305,122 people 65 years and older in Stockholm, Sweden, who did not have a dementia diagnosis at baseline and had recorded kidney function measures. After a diagnosis of AKI, the study participants were monitored for any dementia.

Dementia occurrence was stratified by AKI history, the severity of AKI, AKI recurrence, and whether their kidney injury was community- or hospital-acquired.

What did the study show?
------------------------

The median participant age was 75 years, 57% of whom were women. During the follow-up period of 12 years, 79,888 cases of AKI and 47,938 cases of dementia were reported.

About 36% of the study cohort was diagnosed with hypertension, whereas 11% and 10% were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation, respectively. About 30% and 25% of the individuals were prescribed beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi and ARB), respectively. About 20% of the study cohort had stages three to five chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The mean age when AKI occurred was 77 years. Hypertension was the most common illness in the AKI subgroup, with a higher prevalence of 69% as compared to 36% in the entire study cohort.

The most frequently prescribed drugs reported in the AKI subgroup included ACEi, ARBs, or beta-blockers. Over 64% of individuals with AKI were also diagnosed with CKD.

Doubled risk of dementia after AKI
----------------------------------

A total of 37 cases of dementia for every 1,000 person-years (PY) was reported among people with a history of AKI. Comparatively, before the AKI incident, the dementia incidence was 17.3 for every 1,000 PY.

After compensating for other confounding factors, the occurrence of AKI was associated with a 50% increased risk of developing any type of dementia as compared to those without a history of AKI.

An increased risk of dementia was associated with Lewy bodies (DLB)/Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) by 88%, 47%, and 31%, respectively.

Severe AKI that required hospitalization rather than outpatient management was associated with an increased dementia risk. The risk was 45% higher after AKI stage one as compared to 61% higher following stages two and three.

Hospital-acquired and hospital-managed AKI was also associated with a 55% higher dementia risk as compared to 31% for community-acquired/community-managed AKI. This risk was similarly increased at 48% and 39% for patients with two and three recurrences of AKI, respectively.

The impact of AKI on different types of dementia
------------------------------------------------

The risk of DLB and PDD was 88% higher in individuals with a history of AKI as compared to an increased risk of 47% and 31% for vascular dementia and AD, respectively. In general, specific dementia types were more common with recurrent AKI and increased AKI severity.

The most common type of dementia was AD, with a total of 17,663 cases from 47,938 dementia diagnoses. Vascular dementia, DLB, PDD, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) accounted for 29.7%, 3.6%, and 1% of dementia cases, respectively.

Age-stratified analyses identified a four-fold increased risk of DLB and PDD among those older than 85 years.

Conclusions
-----------

> _This study identifies individuals with AKI as a population at high risk of dementia who may benefit from close monitoring for early detection and implementation of antidementia strategies_.‚Äù

The study findings confirm previous studies reporting a two-fold risk of dementia among people hospitalized with AKI while also extending these observations to a broader patient sample over a longer duration. The researchers also identified a dose-response relationship between dementia risk and AKI history, thus supporting a causal association between these two diseases.

2024-09-03 06:53:00,2024-09-04 02:18:46,"üö® Exciting Update in Diabetes Monitoring! üö®

Recent research from Klick Labs published in _Scientific Reports_ reveals a significant link between blood glucose levels and voice pitch in individuals with Type 2 diabetes.

Key Takeaways:
- **Study Scope:** Analyzed voice frequency changes in 505 participants (non-diabetic, prediabetic, Type 2 diabetic) with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).
- **Findings:** A linear correlation was found; higher blood glucose levels lead to an increase in voice pitch frequency.
- **Implications:** This breakthrough could pave the way for non-invasive, voice-based glucose monitoring, making it as simple as speaking into a smartphone.
- **Future Research:** Highlights the necessity to expand research into vocal biomarkers for diabetes management and monitoring.

===================================================================================================

As part of its ongoing exploration of vocal biomarkers and the role they can play in enhancing health outcomes, Klick Labs published a new study in _Scientific Reports_ today ‚Äì confirming the link between blood glucose levels and voice pitch and opening the door to future advancements in non-invasive glucose monitoring for people living with Type 2 diabetes.

In ""_Linear Effects of Glucose Levels on Voice Fundamental Frequency in Type 2 diabetes and Individuals with Normoglycemia_,"" researchers investigated how blood glucose levels influence the frequency of the voice in 505 participants across three glycemic statuses ‚Äì non-diabetic, prediabetic, and Type-2 diabetic. Participants were fitted with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and recorded their voices multiple times daily for two weeks. The analysis revealed a linear relationship where an increase in CGM glucose levels corresponded to an increase in the fundamental frequency in the voice.

> By establishing a significant positive association between glucose levels and fundamental frequency, our study provides compelling justification for more research on using voice to predict and monitor glucose levels. Whereas current glucose monitoring methods are often invasive and inconvenient, voice-based glucose monitoring could be as easy as talking into a smartphone, which could change the game for the estimated 463 million people around the world living with Type 2 diabetes.""

> Jaycee Kaufman, lead author and scientist at Klick Labs

Klick Labs' latest research marks another step forward in its ongoing commitment to revolutionizing the detection and management of diabetes using voice tech and machine learning. Their October 2023 study in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health_ demonstrated that voice and AI can screen for Type 2 diabetes with high accuracy. Previously, their _""Screening for Impaired Glucose Homeostasis: A Novel Metric of Glycemic Control""_ research also appeared in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health_ (May 2023), and their _""Homeostasis as a proportional‚Äìintegral control system""_ study was published in _Nature Digital Medicine_ (May 2020).

=============== 

Moderna's RSV vaccine is the third approved for the treatment of people aged 60 and over.

The European Commission on Friday approved Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults‚Äîthe first time the bloc has authorised an mRNA shot against a disease other than COVID-19.

RSV is a highly contagious seasonal virus that can cause severe symptoms in infants and the elderly‚Äîone in 20 of whom contract it each year in Europe, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

In the European Union, Norway and United Kingdom, RSV leads to the hospitalization of around 158,000 adults each year, as well as some 213,000 children under five, according to ECDC data.

""Vaccination saves lives,"" the EU's commissioner for health and food safety, Stella Kyriakides, said in a statement announcing the approval of Moderna's mResvia vaccine.

""We are determined to ensure that everyone has access to the protection that they need against serious diseases.""

The authorization, which follows a similar step by the US Food and Drug Administration in May, is based on a positive assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in June.

The EMA approved the use of mResvia for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD), which is caused by RSV, in adults of 60 and older.

The EU had previously approved two vaccines for protecting against RSV, manufactured by Pfizer and GSK.

GSK and Pfizer's vaccines rely on traditional technology: introducing a pathogen component to the immune system to trigger a response.

In contrast, Moderna's vaccine utilizes cutting-edge messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, instructing the body to produce a unique protein that stimulates an immune response, teaching it to defend against the infection.

""This approval of the first mRNA vaccine against RSV clearly shows the importance of innovation when it comes to protecting the health of our citizens,"" Kyriakides said.

Stephane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive, said the commission's approval was ""an important milestone for public health and highlights Moderna's mRNA leadership.""

=================================================================================

NXP800 was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of ARID1a-deficient ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.

The novel GCN2 kinase activator NXP800 received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1a (ARID1a) ARID1a-deficient ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers, according to a news release from Nuvectis Pharma, Inc.

‚ÄúWe are very pleased to have received this designation from the FDA for NXP800. The prevalence of ovarian cancer, which is comprised of ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers, exceeds the 200,000-patient threshold below which drugs may be eligible to receive orphan drug designation in the United States,‚Äù Ron Bentsur, MBA, chairman and CEO of Nuvectis, stated in the news release.

The oral small-molecule inhibitor targets the HSF1 pathway, and it has shown strong anti-tumor effects in xenograft models of ARID1a-mutated ovarian carcinoma, as well as in other disease models.

Notably, the FDA granted fast track designation to NXP800 for patients with platinum-resistant, ARID1a-mutated ovarian carcinoma in December 2022, which was then followed by the initiation of the phase 1b clinical trial (NCT05226507) of NXP800 in platinum-resistant, ARID1a-mutated ovarian cancers in April 2023.

‚ÄúIn ovarian cancer it has been uncommon to receive this designation for the treatment of a subset of the disease. We therefore believe that this orphan drug designation granted by the FDA for NXP800 for the treatment of a subset of ovarian cancer, specifically for patients with an ARID1a deficiency, provides further validation for NXP800's mechanism of action and the target patient population in our ongoing phase 1b clinical trial in patients with platinum-resistant, ARID1a-mutated ovarian cancer,‚Äù Bentsur added in the news release.

At the 2024 SGO Annual Meeting on Women‚Äôs Cancer, investigators shared an overview of the ongoing study.

The ongoing phase 1b trial is enrolling patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer harboring ARID1A mutations, which is typically a tumor type that is mostly comprised of ovarian clear-cell carcinoma and ovarian endometrioid carcinoma. To be eligible for enrollment, patients must be 18 years of age or older, have measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, have experienced disease progression within 6 months from completion of platinum-based therapy, and must have received between 1 and 5 prior lines of systemic therapy, including at least 1 regimen containing bevacizumab (Avastin). Additionally, all patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and participants with a BRCA mutation must have received prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor.

Patients who did not respond to, or progressed during, or within 4 weeks of the last dose of first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy were excluded. Treatment with radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or an investigational agent within 28 days of the first dose of NXP800 was also not permitted, nor were active brain metastases.

The phase 1b portion of the trial is currently open for enrollment in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

Regarding the phase 1a portion of the study, which was the first-in-human clinical trial of NXP800, as of April 2023, a total of 18 patients have received at least one dose of NXP800, with the longest treatment duration reaching 10 months, and treatment is still ongoing for some participants. The investigation evaluated 2 different dosing schedules of the agent, including once daily (with total daily doses ranging from 50 mg to 150 mg) and twice daily (with total daily doses of 100 mg and 150 mg).

Furthermore, the most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported were vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, decreased appetite, and weight loss.

For the phase 1b study, doses of 50 mg and 75 mg per day were selected and were chosen based on preliminary population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic analyses, which indicated that once-daily oral administration of NXP800 at these levels achieved biologically active exposure while maintaining an acceptable safety and tolerability profile.

‚ÄúWe expect to provide a data update from this study this coming fall,‚Äù Bentsur concluded.",gpt-4o-mini

==========================================================================

With 1k new patients a month, the company has almost quadrupled its revenue in one year
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4 min read

UK-based healthtech Doccla has secured a ¬£35m Series B, led by European VC Lakestar, with new investors French VC Elaia and existing investors General Catalyst, Speedinvest and the investment leg of German media company Bertelsmann also participating.

Having almost quadrupled its annual revenue in 2023, it's planning its expansion in DACH and France, and says its German and French investors will help its international growth plans.

The startup, founded in 2019, makes ""virtual ward"" technology for healthcare providers. It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.

Doccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland‚Äôs Health Service Executive (HSE).

Doccla‚Äôs founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.

‚ÄúWith the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it‚Äôs a huge opportunity to scale,‚Äù says Ratz.

The virtual A&E

Sweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.

According to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.

Patients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.

So far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it‚Äôs adding 1k new patients every month.

‚ÄúOver time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,‚Äù Ratz says.

Partnering with pharma

Doccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).

‚ÄúWe have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,‚Äù Ratz says. ‚ÄúThis is because we are in very close contact with our patients.‚Äù

Doccla says it‚Äôs interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he‚Äôs seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.

With 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.

In one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.

‚ÄúWe can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits ‚Äî in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,‚Äù Ratz says.

Doccla has raised a total of ¬£52m to date.

In October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.",gpt-4o-mini

The round is made up of $80m in equity and $100m in debt ‚Äî and is tied to specific milestones. The fresh funding tops up the startup‚Äôs $130m Series C, raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.

It‚Äôs the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.

Caresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.

### AI for hospitals

Caresyntax says it wants to build the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals‚Äô surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.

The company‚Äôs platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.

While some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax‚Äôs platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.

‚ÄúEffectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,‚Äù they add.

If it does what it sets out to do, it‚Äôs a big opportunity.

Costs associated with operations account for 30% of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends 11% of GDP on health.

Founded in 2013 in Germany ‚Äî Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 ‚Äî its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company‚Äôs revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.

### The rise of smart surgery

The round comes on the back of a strong 18 months for startups developing tech for the operating theatre.

Since the start of 2023, three of the four biggest medtech raises have all gone to startups building robots to help surgeons. The UK‚Äôs CMR Surgical picked up ¬£165m in September last year, Switzerland‚Äôs DistalMotion $150m in April 2023 and Italy‚Äôs Medical Microinstruments $110m in February this year.

Investors in Caresyntax‚Äôs round include Symbiotic Capital, MTIP AG, BIONIQ Capital, PFM Health Sciences, Pictet Alternative Advisors, surgical.ai, BlackRock Innovation Capital, Aescuvest, Optum Ventures, Cure Capital, Relyens Group, Vesalius Biocapital, Lauxera Capital, Plug & Play Growth Fund and ProAssurance Corp.",gpt-4o-mini

---

The meteoric rise of a new class of weight loss drugs over the past two years, known as GLP-1s, has seen a new name take the title of Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, helped a country dodge a recession and hit grocery sales in the US.

The valuations of the companies that make this so-called ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù class of drugs ‚Äî which includes Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and US rival Eli Lilly (maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) ‚Äî have soared as investors bet big on a medication projected by some to hit $150bn in sales by the early 2030s.

The potential of the market has not been lost on founders.

It‚Äôs a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù opportunity, says Kai Eberhardt, the founder and CEO of Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform which operates in the UK, France and Germany, alongside its home market. It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.

‚ÄúFor us [GLP-1 drugs] are already a strong growth driver,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.‚Äù

While treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva‚Äôs overall business ‚Äî Eberhardt says it‚Äôs growing total patient and revenue numbers by ‚Äúdouble digit‚Äù percentage points year-on-year ‚Äî the meds could become the startup‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest‚Äù growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.

### Riding the wave

Oviva‚Äôs not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity ‚Äî many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.

In the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart‚Äôs CEO, food sales have fallen as the one in eight adults in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, propping up Denmark‚Äôs GDP in the process.

All of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have convinced them to get out their chequebook: Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a ‚Ç¨10m Series A in August 2023 a year on from a ‚Ç¨3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised ‚Ç¨3.1m last summer.

Many startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn‚Äôt start life offering them ‚Äî largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.

UK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs health‚Äù brand, but has recently changed that. The company‚Äôs website uses images of men and women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.

Yazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.

Meurling tells Sifted it had hit ‚Ç¨14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It‚Äôs now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.

Other startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men‚Äôs sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.

‚Äú[GLP-1 meds] are a game changer,‚Äù says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be ‚Äústrange‚Äù if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn‚Äôt looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.

While GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the ‚Äúhype‚Äù surrounding the drug class has ‚Äúopened doors‚Äù for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler ‚Äî adding that the startup managed to raise its ‚Ç¨400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It‚Äôs now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it‚Äôll look to target US employers ‚Äî who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.

### Kinks in the supply chain

There are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector ‚Äî not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.

Some of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate‚Äôs $100m in 2021 and Form Health‚Äôs $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than ‚Ç¨10m in a single round.

Investors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics ‚Äî Manual was still selling past the deadline.

If a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.

‚ÄúAs there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.‚Äù

### Who‚Äôll stump up the cash?

There‚Äôs also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.

While Numan‚Äôs head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the ‚Äúsuccess of private sector companies offering GLP-1 [drugs] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS‚Äù, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won‚Äôt be enough to hit real scale.

‚ÄúUS investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts [selling to whole organisations like health insurers],‚Äù says Syhler. ‚ÄúThis means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care ‚Äî where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.‚Äù

In Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.

In the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.

Oviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS ‚Äî but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it‚Äôs in ‚Äúmature dialogues with several health systems‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,‚Äù says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that don‚Äôt always want to work with startups. Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.

Whether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen ‚Äî but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. ‚ÄúI've never been an investor in a company that‚Äôs got so much attention ‚Äî in a space that‚Äôs got so much attention,‚Äù says Arnardottir.",gpt-4o-mini

On Wednesday UK-based period tracking app Flo Health announced it had raised $200m ‚Äî pushing its valuation beyond $1bn and making it Europe‚Äôs first femtech unicorn.

It turned out to be a very buzzy story: as people were quick to point out online, Flo also became Europe‚Äôs first women‚Äôs health unicorn with an all-male founding team ‚Äî a detail which sparked a backlash online.

‚ÄúA company founded by men, led by men and funded by men became the first WOMEN'S health app to achieve unicorn status. If this doesn't show you everything that's wrong with the ecosystem, I don't know what will,‚Äù Anna-Sophie Hartvigsen, cofounder of investment learning app and community for women Female Invest, wrote in a viral LinkedIn post, citing stats on the lack of funding for female founders. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad that a femtech company is doing well,‚Äù she later added in the comments. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs bad that only men are able to succeed in this space.‚Äù

Some founders in the comments underneath Hartvigsen's post said that they‚Äôve struggled with fundraising as a woman; there was also a debate in a private WhatsApp group seen by Sifted about whether female founders should add a token male founder to their team in an effort to increase their chances of getting cheques. Someone in that group added that we won‚Äôt fix the trend of men funding men until there are more female investors.

But others didn‚Äôt see it that way.

‚ÄúThis achievement should actually be celebrated. As a women's health investor that has invested in 7+ women's health companies, we are yet to see any of them scale,‚Äù Deepali Nangia, a partner at Speedinvest, wrote in response to Hartvigsen‚Äôs LinkedIn post. ‚ÄúFlo's achievement is a very strong signal to the market that [direct to consumer] women's health is monetizable in Europe and that there is money to be made here; this is what investors need to see so more money flows into women's health companies. Not to say that the challenges faced by women in pitching are any less, but we must celebrate all wins that lead to more capital deployed into this sector,‚Äù she argued.

Nangia added that she wasn‚Äôt doubting there‚Äôs a problem, ‚Äúbut every win should not be turned around to a problem‚Ä¶ Many people have been working on solving for this problem, which includes many women of course but also men.‚Äù

Another commenter added: ‚ÄúIf anything, let this be a door for more investors to look closely at the female health industry and invest their money there? Could this be an example of men allies? If it had to be a company founded and led by men, well thank you very much for opening the door, now let the rest go through.‚Äù

Priya Oberoi, partner at women‚Äôs health-focused VC Goddess Gaia Ventures, added: ‚ÄúFlo reaching series C [unicorn] status with 60 mln active users is a win for #womenshealth - helping to close that 131 year gender health gap and getting products and services out there to improve the lives of women.‚Äù

""We firmly believe that women's health has been critically overlooked, undervalued and underfunded for far too long,"" Flo said in a statement to Sifted. ""Our sincere hope is that Flo‚Äôs funding will inspire more investors to recognise the immense potential in this space."" The company added: ""We're proud to say that more than half (56%) of Flo's employees are women, including our leadership team.""

It‚Äôs an important debate, and, readers, I‚Äôm curious to hear your thoughts: why aren‚Äôt there more female-founded femtech unicorns?

**TOPLINE:**
------------

Higher thiazide doses are linked to greater reductions in urine calcium levels, which correlate with fewer symptomatic kidney stone events. This association suggests that adjusting thiazide dosage could be crucial in kidney stone prevention.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   The efficacy of using thiazides for kidney stone prevention was called into question by [the NOSTONE trial](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2209275), which found no added benefit of hydrochlorothiazide over a placebo in preventing kidney stone recurrence in high-risk patients.
*   Using the Medicare-Litholink Database, researchers identified adult participants with kidney stones prescribed thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, or indapamide) within 6 months after initial 24-hour urine collection and who underwent follow-up urine collections between 30 and 180 days after their first thiazide prescription fill.
*   Thiazide dosages were classified as:
    *   Low (chlorthalidone, < 12.5 mg/d; indapamide, < 0.6125 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, < 25 mg/d)
    *   Medium (chlorthalidone, 12.5 to < 25 mg/d; indapamide, 0.6125 to < 1.25 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, 25 to < 50 mg/d)
    *   High (chlorthalidone, ‚â• 25 mg/d; indapamide, ‚â• 1.25 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, ‚â• 50 mg/d)
*   Changes in calcium levels in response to low, medium, and high thiazide dosages were evaluated. These changes were correlated with the incidence of symptomatic stone events, identified by emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or surgeries for stones within 6-48 months after the initial prescription fill.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   Researchers included 634 adults with kidney stones (mean age, 67.6 years; 46.5% women).
*   Higher thiazide doses were associated with greater reductions in urine calcium levels, with a low dose resulting in an 18.9% reduction, a medium dose in a 25.5% reduction, and a high dose in a 28.4% reduction (_P_ = .02).
*   At 4 years, the adjusted cumulative incidence of symptomatic stone events was 28.8%, 19.5%, and 18.0% for a low, an intermediate, and a high tercile of change in urine calcium levels, respectively, after thiazide prescription (_P_ = .04 for trend).

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

Considering the study's findings, experts from the University of California, San Francisco, and other institutions wrote in [an accompanying editorial](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.28927) that ""clinicians need to first identify patients with hypercalciuria and then aggressively treat them with thiazide diuretics to yield the most benefit in reducing kidney stone recurrence,"" adding, ""However, most clinicians likely prefer to start at low dosages and then titrate the dosage based on adverse effects and efficacy.""

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

This study's limitations included the possibility of omitted variable bias and unmeasured differences between participants prescribed different dosages of thiazides. The sample consisted mostly of older adults, potentially limiting generalizability.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

This study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. The authors declared no conflicts of interests.

===============

This site is intended for UK healthcare professionals

TOPLINE:
--------

In the first meta-analysis of its kind, Swiss researchers find that only 14% of men treated for testicular cancer develop infertility. This is very reassuring considering that the majority of cancer survivors, up to 77%, express interest in paternity after completing cancer treatment.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

* A meta-analysis of 30 studies of fertility, with 13,718 men after unilateral testicular cancer. In all, 25 of the studies were from Europe, four were from Asia, and one was from the United States.
* Studies were identified by a search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases (2000-2022).
* Infertility, the primary outcome, was defined by azoospermia at least 12 months after oncological treatment, and failure to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of regular unprotected sexual intercourse and/or usage of cryosperm.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

* Treatment for testicular cancer included: active surveillance after unilateral orchidectomy (32.7%); radiotherapy (23.1%); standard- or low-dose chemotherapy (33.7%); and high-dose chemotherapy (1.4%).
* In a quantitative synthesis of 23 of the 30 studies, the overall pooled infertility prevalence was 14% (95% CI, 9%-21%).
* Azoospermia was observed in 8% (95% CI, 6%-12%).
* In the subgroup analysis of patients with good prognosis who received standard therapy, infertility prevalence was only 4% (95% CI, 2%-10%).

IN PRACTICE:
------------

The authors concluded that ""Despite the low prevalence of infertility, it is still recommended to undergo sperm cryopreservation because of the uncertainty of the subsequent therapy and the lack of large longitudinal data on individual treatment effects.""

**Key Points**

**Question**  
Is œâ-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA; ie, fish oil) supplementation during pregnancy associated with reduced risk of childhood atopic dermatitis (AD) in mothers carrying specific cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) genotypes?

**Findings**  
In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial including 635 mother-child pairs with 10-year follow-up, a reduced risk of childhood AD until age 10 years was found only for mothers carrying the COX1 TT genotype who received n-3 LCPUFA supplements. There was increased AD risk among children of mothers with the CC genotype and no association overall or for mothers carrying the CT genotype.

**Meaning**  
The findings support use of a personalized prevention strategy for reducing the burden of childhood AD by genotyping expecting mothers in early pregnancy and providing n-3 LCPUFA supplementation only to women carrying the COX1 TT genotype.

**Abstract**

**Importance**  
Eicosanoids have a pathophysiological role in atopic dermatitis (AD), but it is unknown whether this is affected by prenatal œâ-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA; ie, fish oil) supplementation and genetic variations in the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) pathway.

**Objective**  
To explore the association of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy with risk of childhood AD overall and by maternal COX1 genotype.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  
This prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial included mother-child pairs from the Danish Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 birth cohort, with prospective follow-up until children were aged 10 years. In the trial, maternal and child COX1 genotypes were determined, and urinary eicosanoids were quantified when the child was 1 year of age. The present study was conducted from January 2019 to December 2021, and data were analyzed from January to September 2023.

**Intervention**  
A total of 736 pregnant women at 24 weeks‚Äô gestation were randomized 1:1 to 2.4 g of n-3 LCPUFA (fish oil) or placebo (olive oil) per day until 1 week post partum.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  
Risk of childhood AD until age 10 years overall and by maternal COX1 genotype.

**Results**  
At age 10 years, 635 children (91%; 363 [57%] female) completed the clinical follow-up, and these mother-child pairs were included in this study; 321 (51%) were in the intervention group and 314 (49%) in the control group. Pregnancy n-3 LCPUFA supplementation was associated with lower urinary thromboxane A2 metabolites at age 1 year (Œ≤, ‚Äì0.46; 95% CI, ‚Äì0.80 to ‚Äì0.13; P = .006), which was also associated with COX1 rs1330344 genotype (Œ≤ per C allele, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.20-0.73; P = .001). Although neither n-3 LCPUFA supplementation (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.76-1.33; P = .97) nor maternal COX1 genotype (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.74-1.19; P = .60) was associated with risk of childhood AD until age 10 years, there was evidence of an interaction between these variables (P < .001 for interaction). Among mothers with the TT genotype, risk of AD was reduced in the n-3 LCPUFA group compared with the placebo group (390 mother-child pairs [61%]; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.98; P = .04); there was no association for mothers with the CT genotype (209 [33%]; HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.79-2.10; P = .31), and risk was increased among offspring of mothers with the CC genotype (37 [6%]; HR, 5.77; 95% CI, 1.63-20.47; P = .007). There was a significant interaction between n-3 LCPUFA supplementation and child COX1 genotype and development of AD (P = .002 for interaction).

**Conclusions and Relevance**  
In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, the association of prenatal n-3 LCPUFA supplementation with risk of childhood AD varied by maternal COX1 genotype. The findings could be used to inform a personalized prevention strategy of providing supplementation only to pregnant individuals with the TT genotype.

==================================================

Edited by Anushree Chaphalkar

**TOPLINE:**¬†
-------------

Compared with other urine analysis methods, urine Gram stain has a moderate predictive value for detecting gram-negative bacteria in urine culture but does not significantly improve urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis in the emergency department (ED).

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Researchers conducted an observational cohort study at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands, encompassing 1358 episodes across 1136 patients suspected of having a UTI.
*   The study included the following predefined subgroups: patients using urinary catheters and patients with leukopenia (< 4.0√ó10‚Åπ leucocytes/L). Urine dipstick nitrite, automated urinalysis, Gram stain, and urine cultures were performed on urine samples collected from patients presenting at the ED.
*   The sensitivity and specificity of Gram stain for ""many"" bacteria (quantified as > 15/high power field) were compared with those of urine dipstick nitrite and automated bacterial counting in urinalysis.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   The sensitivity and specificity of Gram stain for ""many"" bacteria were 51.3% and 91.0%, respectively, with an accuracy of 76.8%.
*   Gram stain showed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 84.7% for gram-negative rods in urine culture; however, the PPV was only 38.4% for gram-positive cocci.
*   In the catheter subgroup, the presence of monomorphic bacteria quantified as ""many"" had a higher PPV for diagnosing a UTI than the presence of polymorphic bacteria with the same quantification.
*   The overall performance of Gram stain in diagnosing a UTI in the ED was comparable to that of automated bacterial counting in urinalysis but better than that of urine dipstick nitrite.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""With the exception of a moderate prediction of gram-negative bacteria in the UC [urine culture], urine GS [Gram stain] does not improve UTI diagnosis at the ED compared to other urine parameters,"" the authors wrote.

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study was led by Stephanie J.M. Middelkoop, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands. It was [published online](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23744235.2024.2389478) on August 16, 2024, in *Infectious Diseases*.

**LIMITATIONS:**¬†
-----------------

The study's limitations included a small sample size within the leukopenia subgroup, which may have affected the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the potential influence of refrigeration of urine samples on bacterial growth could have affected the results. In this study, indwelling catheters were not replaced before urine sample collection, which may have affected the accuracy of UTI diagnosis in patients using catheters.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

No conflicts of interest were disclosed by the authors.

GPs‚Äô roles have changed enormously over the past few years. Having worked in the same practice for over 40 years, I perhaps see things from a different perspective, but I don‚Äôt think I am alone in this. I am a mentor to a few GPs in the national New to Practice Programme, and those I meet feel the same. The responsibility for making clinical decisions rests with GPs despite increasing involvement from other healthcare professionals. These practitioners have differing skill sets and lead on clinical areas that are rapidly changing; at present, these changes are not always shared with GPs. Better communication and understanding of any changes will enable more effective collaboration in primary care, facilitating provision of a quality service for patients‚Äîeven if the way primary care does this has changed.

### GPs as the Backstop 

One example of GPs charting unfamiliar territory when supporting the patients of another healthcare professional is evident in the management of diabetes. Many patients with diabetes are now managed by specialist diabetes nurses; however, when one of these patients has a problem and the nurse is unavailable, a GP is often asked to solve the problem. For significantly unwell patients, hospital admission is the best option, but for most queries, knowledge of current best practice in diabetes is needed. Fortunately, the regular general updates most GPs do with medical education providers such as NB Medical Education or Red Whale provide most of the answers.

Similarly, a pregnant patient may need medical advice the same day, but has been unable to contact the midwife team, so it falls to the GP. Some problems are not pregnancy related, such as respiratory infections. Others can present problems, such as aching calves with no abnormality found on examination. Testing the patient‚Äôs D-dimer level would not be helpful because it is raised in pregnancy anyway. Venous thromboembolism is more common in pregnant than nonpregnant women. GPs may feel unskilled, as midwife teams now look after most antenatal patients. Advice is on hand from the local obstetric unit‚Äîbut again, the clinician with the least experience is the first to be contacted.

### The Fundamentals of Effective Collaboration 

In well-developed practice teams, there is good communication, and complex problems are solved by adopting a multifaceted approach. So, how can primary care teams collaborate more effectively to achieve the best result?

Teams that work effectively together demonstrate a mixture of professional skills, mutual professional respect, and clear team communication. The King‚Äôs Fund has published a summary of how to achieve these elements of effective collaboration. The three main components are:

*   **a small number of meaningful objectives**‚Äîobjectives that team members are equally responsible for, to create a sense of shared purpose, trust, and collective achievement
*   **clear roles and responsibilities among team members**‚Äîoutlining what activities need to be done and by whom, to ensure that everything is completed and to clarify each member‚Äôs roles and strengths; this should be reviewed regularly
*   **reflection on how the team is working together**‚Äîthis can be in any form (for example, away days or team ‚Äòhuddles‚Äô), to cover both the technical aspects of work as well as how people are feeling; it is important that everyone feels safe to freely express themselves regardless of their role.

### Improving Communication and Teamwork 

Google‚Äôs 2-year research project into cultivating great teams found that the highest-performing teams had one thing in common‚Äîpsychological safety, or the belief that members can speak up or make mistakes without retribution. This is an important goal that primary care team leaders should aim for, as people become more creative, resilient, and motivated when they feel safe.

One way to improve communication is through huddles, which are short, frequent check-ins to discuss the day‚Äôs patients and tasks. Huddles can allow for the discussion of patient-specific issues and clarification of responsibilities.

Furthermore, digital communication tools, such as email and video conferencing, are also critical, as each team member will need access to shared patient records and booking systems to view and share information easily when needed‚Äîfor example, on home visits.

Finally, the physical environmental also plays a role in supporting new teams to function. Shared working spaces are the default location when team members are not seeing a patient, and these spaces have many benefits, such as improving integration and team cohesion, enabling real-time communication in huddles, and facilitating information sharing between team members. The King‚Äôs Fund highlights that team members are more likely to be sensitive to one another‚Äôs problems and appreciate each other‚Äôs roles when they have this sort of contact with each other.

### Ensuring Clinical Accountability and Supportive Management 

Clinical supervision, appraisals, and learning and development opportunities are essential to ensure that all team members are held to professional standards and encouraged to reflect on their own practice.

Clinical supervision and appraisals are essential requirements for all healthcare professionals. There are many effective models of clinical supervision, including one-to-one, group, or peer supervision. Clinical supervision should be developed by teams to meet their needs. Appraisals are a requirement in the NHS and should be focused on a shared understanding of team goals, two-way communication, and setting goals for the future. In addition, all team members need to have the skills, knowledge, and experience to deliver effective care. Identifying the needs of team members and ensuring access to training and opportunities to develop is critical for all healthcare professionals to maintain their registration and stay up to date with current practice.

The face of primary care is changing, and making sure that all team members stay on top of changes to their roles and responsibilities is important for fostering a harmonious and effective environment that encourages collaboration and enables provision of a superb service to patients. To those of you who are already doing all of this‚Äîwell done!",gpt-4o-mini
