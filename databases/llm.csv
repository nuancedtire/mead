Recent findings from the CheckMate-9ER study reveal intriguing insights into the role of serum glycoproteins in predicting treatment outcomes for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here‚Äôs what we learned:

- GLYCOSYLATION PATTERNS MATTER: Increased fucosylation and sialylation of serum proteins correlate with poorer outcomes for patients treated with nivolumab (Opdivo) plus cabozantinib (Cabometyx) compared to sunitinib (Sutent).
- POTENTIAL PREDICTIVE BIOMARKERS: High serum levels of CO3 glycopeptide may indicate a favorable response to the nivolumab-cabozantinib combination, while low levels of CFAH glycopeptide suggest a similar trend.
- CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study emphasizes the need for effective biomarkers to identify which patients will benefit most from anti‚ÄìPD-1 therapies, as current genomic approaches may not capture the full picture.
- LONG-TERM EFFICACY: The combination therapy continues to show significant improvements in progression-free survival (16.4 months vs. 8.4 months) and overall survival (46.5 months vs. 36.0 months) compared to sunitinib.

As we delve deeper into the complexities of protein glycosylation, could these findings pave the way for personalized treatment strategies in RCC?

CheckMate-9ER post hoc analysis suggests certain sugar molecules on blood proteins may predict how well nivolumab and cabozantinib in kidney cancer treatment works.

More fucosylation and sialylation of serum proteins showed to be negative prognostic factors for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and linked with worse clinical outcomes for nivolumab (Opdivo) plus cabozantinib (Cabometyx) and sunitinib (Sutent) treatment, according to findings from an exploratory post hoc analysis of the phase 3 CheckMate-9ER study (NCT03141177).

The data, which were shared during the 2024 ESMO Congress, also suggested that serum glycoproteins involved in complement cascade and lipid metabolism could be predictive of response to the doublet vs sunitinib in this disease, according to David A. Braun, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine (Medical Oncology) and Louis Goodman and Alfred Gilman Yale Scholar at Yale School of Medicine, in New Haven, Connecticut. Specifically, high serum levels of CO3 glycopeptide are potentially predictive of favorable response to the nivolumab plus cabozantinib vs sunitinib, as are low serum levels of CFAH glycopeptide.

‚ÄúWe see that higher amounts of protein glycosylation, both sialylation and fucosylation, appear to be prognostic in this data set, and that specific protein glycosylation events related to lipid metabolism, but also related to the complement cascade, have the potential to [possibly] be predictive of response in anti‚ÄìPD-1-based therapy, as opposed to sunitinib,‚Äù Braun said in a presentation of the data. ‚ÄúBut I want to highlight this is really early exploratory work. I [believe] the main question is, is this an area for further investigation in biomarker development in RCC? And I [believe] the answer to that is, yes.‚Äù

CheckMate-9ER enrolled patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with a clear cell component. They could have disease of any risk by International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria, but they needed to have tumor tissue available for analysis.

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 240 mg of intravenous (IV) nivolumab every 2 weeks paired with 40 mg of oral cabozantinib once daily vs 50 mg of oral sunitinib on a cycle of 4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off. Treatment continued until disease progression by RECIST v1.1 criteria or intolerable toxicity. Stratification factors included IMDC risk score, tumor PD-L1 expression, and geographic region.

The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review committee (BICR) and RECIST 1.1 criteria. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) by BICR and RECIST 1.1 criteria, as well as safety. Health-related quality of life served as an important exploratory end point.

In January 2021, the FDA approved nivolumab plus cabozantinib for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC based on earlier data from CheckMate-9ER. Data from the 55-month follow-up of the study shared during the 2024 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium showed that nivolumab plus cabozantinib continues to provide a meaningful improvement over sunitinib in PFS, OS, and ORR. In the intention-to-treat population, the PFS by BICR was 16.4 months (95% CI, 12.5-19.3) with the doublet vs 8.4 months (95% CI, 7.0-9.7) with sunitinib (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49-0.70). The median OS with nivolumab plus cabozantinib was 46.5 months (95% CI, 40.6-53.4) vs 36.0 months (95% CI, 29.2-42.8) with sunitinib (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95). The ORR by BICR was 55.7% with the doublet vs 27.7% with sunitinib.

‚Äú[Although] anti‚ÄìPD-1‚Äìbased therapy is really the standard for first-line RCC, we still lack effective biomarkers to figure out which patients are likely to respond, and which tumors are likely to be resistant to therapy. Our group, and many others, have focused largely on the genomics and transcriptomics of the tumor itself, but we know that posttranslational modifications of proteins themselves play an important role in those proteins‚Äô function,‚Äù Braun said. ‚ÄúIn fact, glycosylation of protein, altered glycosylation, is a hallmark of cancer and involved in many malignant processes. Hypersialylation in particular, engages sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin receptors and is known to be immunomodulatory, potentially raising the idea that it could contribute to anti‚ÄìPD-1 resistance.‚Äù

For the post hoc analysis, Braun and colleagues evaluated the link between site-specific glycopeptide modifications with nivolumab plus cabozantinib/sunitinib response in patients with advanced RCC by leveraging pre-treatment serum samples. They used the InterVenn GlycoVision platform to conduct a glycoproteomic analysis, to understand if altered protein glycosylation is a possible avenue for biomarker studies in RCC. They identified 24 serum glycopeptides that were linked with PFS or OS with the doublet.

‚ÄúThe first question is, how are these regulated? Are they regulated in a coordinated fashion or not? We looked across patients for site-specific protein glycosylation, [and what] we can see is highly coordinated modules of altered protein glycosylation, [with] red piercing correlations across patients for these different site-specific glycosylations,‚Äù Braun said. ‚ÄúNow, in our initial study and our initial look at these particular proteins, we can see that these coordinated modules seem to be associated with altered PFS and OS with nivolumab plus cabozantinib, either positively or negatively. So, this gave us some initial insight for further study, that these are highly coordinated and potentially associated with clinical outcome.‚Äù

Braun added that the next question posed by the investigators was whether the total amount of glycosylation is important and if it plays a role in clinical outcomes. To that end, they examined the total amount of 2 forms of glycosylation: sialyation and fucosylation.

‚ÄúWe see basically an increasing amount of glycosylation, the number of amino acid residues that have a sialic acid or a fucose residue. As we can see, for both nivolumab [plus] cabozantinib and sunitinib, when you have more glycosylation, you have a higher hazard ratio, [which is] essentially worse PFS and OS with more protein glycosylation,‚Äù Braun explained. ‚ÄúThis at least raises the potential that this could be prognostic and really reinforces prior studies seen in melanoma. So that‚Äôs a potential prognostic role.‚Äù

They then set out to evaluate whether this marker could be predictive for response to the doublet vs the monotherapy. When they look across several protein glycosylations, 2 patterns emerged, Braun noted. ‚ÄúOne, proteins involved in lipid metabolism, and the second were members of the complement cascade,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOne is CO3. And what we can see is that at low levels of protein glycosylation, there‚Äôs [essentially] no difference between nivolumab plus cabozantinib or sunitinib with respect to PFS, but at high levels of protein glycosylation, this is where we see tremendous benefit from nivolumab plus cabozantinib. This is hypothesis generating. This is a proinflammatory complement protein, so could this be mediating complement-induced antitumor activity?‚Äù

The opposite pattern was observed for CFAH glycopeptide. He noted that high levels of the checkpoint did not show benefit from the doublet whereas when the protein glycosylation was low, substantial benefit was observed with the combination. ‚ÄúThe hypothesis is that this negative regulator of alternate complement activity, when it‚Äôs low, that‚Äôs when the immune therapy is able to act,‚Äù Braun said.

He concluded that the prognostic or predictive potential of glycopeptide biomarkers should be further examined in additional clinical trials.

===============================================================================================

by University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio

New research is more closely linking obesity to dementia. Higher levels of leptin, a hormone that helps maintain normal body weight, is associated with better signal-transmitting brain white matter in middle-aged adults, according to a study by The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio).

""The findings support the known role of leptin variations in late-life dementia risk by relating its deficiency with changes in white matter structure, which is an early event in the process of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia,"" said Claudia Satizabal, Ph.D., associate professor at the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio.

Satizabal is lead author of a study titled ""Leptin bioavailability and markers of brain atrophy and vascular injury in the middle age,"" published Aug. 12 in Alzheimer's & Dementia. Other authors also are with the Biggs Institute, as well as Tufts Medical Center in Boston; the Framingham Heart Study; Boston University School of Public Health; University of California-Davis; National and Kapodistrian University of Athens; and Columbia University.

Obesity and Alzheimer's
-----------------------

Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia, impacting the lives of millions of people worldwide, the study notes. Increasing evidence suggests that midlife obesity is an important contributor to the risk of developing the disease.

This has led to a growing interest in untangling the mechanisms linking obesity to Alzheimer's, which potentially extend through vascular, genetic and metabolic pathways. The study of adipose or fatty tissue has led to significant insights.

Once viewed as a passive reservoir for energy storage, adipose tissue is now considered a part of the endocrine system, secreting a group of bioactive peptides known as adipokines, or cell-signaling molecules that play functional roles in the energy or metabolic status of the body, inflammation and obesity.

Leptin is an adipokine responsible for central control of food intake and energy homeostasis, and has been implicated in a variety of neurophysiological functions, including brain development, neurogenesis and neuroprotection.

Because of these effects, it has been considered a plausible mechanism in the pathway leading from obesity to Alzheimer's disease. It is supported by findings tying higher leptin levels to lower risk for incident Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, as well as better structural brain indicators in older adults, the study notes.

Still, studies conducted in younger individuals have not detected associations between leptin and early indicators of brain damage preceding late-life dementia risk. Researchers in the new study at UT Health San Antonio aimed to gain further insights into the potential relationships of leptin with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular burden.

Specifically, they investigated the associations of leptin markers with cognitive function and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of brain atrophy and vascular injury in healthy middle-aged adults.

They conducted neuropsychological evaluations of 2,262 cognitively healthy participants from the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term cardiovascular cohort study of residents from Framingham, Massachusetts, spanning three generations and now a project of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, in collaboration with Boston University.

The scientists measured concentrations of leptin, its soluble leptin receptor and their ratio, known as the free leptin index, indicating leptin bioavailability, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Cognitive and MRI measures were derived using standardized protocols.

The results found a higher association of the soluble leptin receptor with lower fractional anisotropy, a biomarker of brain white-matter integrity, and peak-width skeletonized mean diffusivity, an imaging marker for white-matter injury. Correspondingly, a higher free leptin index was associated with higher fractional anisotropy.

These results were replicated in a study that included 89 cognitively healthy Hispanic participants from San Antonio, by MarkVCID, a consortium of U.S. academic medical centers whose mission is to identify and validate biomarkers for the small vessel diseases of the brain that produce vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).

Taken together, the researchers concluded that higher leptin bioavailability was associated with better white-matter integrity in healthy middle-aged adults, supporting the putative neuroprotective role of leptin in late-life dementia risk.

Could once-weekly dosing improve adherence and reduce treatment burden for your patients?","Armed with $100m funding, F2G prepares to refile antifungal

Friday 20 September 2024

UK biotech F2G has raised $100 million as it prepares to refile its olorofim candidate for invasive fungal infections, which was turned down last year by the FDA.

The Manchester-based company said the new cash will help it to complete the late-stage development of olorofim, a novel oral antifungal for invasive aspergillosis and other serious fungal infections, to support the company during the regulatory review process, and prepare for a commercial launch in the US.

F2G's first attempt to win FDA approval for olorofim resulted in a complete response letter (CRL) from the agency saying there was a need for additional data that meant it would be unable to complete its review within the allotted time.

The biotech has spent the intervening period running trials to shore up the data on the drug, which it hopes could end a two-decade drought in novel therapies for invasive fungal infections in the US.

Olorofim (formerly F901318) is the first in a new class of orotomide antifungal agents intended to provide a new treatment option for serious fungal infections when the current armamentarium of azoles, echinocandins, and polyene-based medicines fail. The FDA granted F2G a breakthrough designation for olorofim in 2019.

Since the first filing, F2G has completed a phase 2b study in patients with invasive aspergillosis, scedosporiosis, lomentosporiosis, fusariosis, scopulariopsis, and coccidioidomycosis infections and limited treatment options ‚Äì which was ongoing when the FDA turned down the application in June 2023.

It has also started a 225-subject phase 3 trial called OASIS, comparing treatment with olorofim to Astellas' AmBisome (liposomal amphotericin B) in invasive aspergillosis, which should generate results next year.

Invasive aspergillosis is a serious infection that typically affects people with compromised immune systems and there are rising rates of resistance to azoles and amphotericin B, the two most effective classes of treatment.

The new financing was led by the AMR Action Fund, said to be the world's largest public-private partnership investing in the development of new antimicrobial therapeutics, and backed up by existing investors Novo Holdings, Advent Life Sciences, Sofinnova Partners, Forbion, Blue Owl Healthcare Opportunities, Morningside Ventures, Brace Pharmaceuticals, and Merifin Capital.

""For decades, clinicians have relied on a handful of antifungal classes, with few mechanisms of action and significant limitations due to spectrum of activity, drug toxicities, or drug-drug interactions,"" said AMR Action Fund's chief executive Henry Skinner, who has joined the board of F2G.

""These therapies are increasingly failing in patients,"" he added. ""We are thrilled to support F2G's team as they develop this urgently needed therapy and seek regulatory approval.""

Olorofim is licensed in Europe and Asia to Japanese pharma Shionogi, which paid $100 million upfront for rights to the drug in 2022, with F2G retaining rights in North America. F2G's last fundraising was in a $70 million round led by Forbion and Sofinnova two years ago.",gpt-4o-mini,placeholder_id_0

Key takeaways:

* Adults with type 1 diabetes had significant declines in body weight at 1 year of off-label semaglutide and tirzepatide use.
* Use of both medications was associated with reductions in total daily insulin dose.

Adults with type 1 diabetes using either semaglutide or tirzepatide off-label had greater decreases in body weight and HbA1c than those not treated with either medication, according to a speaker.

As Healio previously reported, researchers at the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus found adults with type 1 diabetes and overweight or obesity using tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound, Eli Lilly) off-label had a 0.67 percentage point reduction in HbA1c and an 18.5% decrease in body weight at 1 year. At the European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meeting, University of Colorado researchers presented more data from their institution of adults with type 1 diabetes who used tirzepatide as well as semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy, Novo Nordisk) off-label.

Data were derived from Snell-Bergeon J, et al. OP 43. Presented at: European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting; Sept. 9-13, 2024; Madrid.

‚ÄúOff-label semaglutide and tirzepatide treatment resulted in significant weight loss and improved glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes, with no reported hospitalization for hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis,‚Äù Janet Snell-Bergeon, PhD, professor of pediatrics at the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said during the presentation.

Researchers conducted a retrospective chart review of 50 adults with type 1 diabetes and overweight or obesity who used semaglutide off-label and 50 adults who used tirzepatide off-label. Propensity score matching was used to compare data from semaglutide and tirzepatide users with 50 controls with type 1 diabetes and overweight or obesity who were not treated with either medication. Changes in BMI, body weight and HbA1c were assessed over a 1-year period.

Reductions in weight, HbA1c

Adults using tirzepatide had a 7.5 kg/m2 decline in BMI and semaglutide users a 3 kg/m2 decrease in BMI from baseline to 12 months (P for treatment difference < .0001). The tirzepatide group had a significantly greater reduction in BMI than controls starting at 3 months and continuing until the end of the study, whereas semaglutide users had a significantly greater decrease in BMI than controls beginning at 6 months and continuing through 1 year.

The tirzepatide group lost 21.4% of their body weight from baseline to 1 year and the semaglutide group achieved a 9.1% weight reduction in that same period (P for treatment difference < .0001). A weight loss of 10% or more at 1 year was achieved by 87% of adults using tirzepatide and 47% of those using semaglutide compared with no participants in the control group (P < .001).

Adults using semaglutide had a 0.54 percentage point decline in HbA1c at 1 year compared with a 0.68 percentage point decrease for those using tirzepatide. Both decreases were greater than the change in the placebo group (P = .008).

Change in total, basal and bolus insulin daily dose was significantly lower for adults using tirzepatide than those using semaglutide or controls. At 1 year, there was no significant difference in the change in total, basal or bolus insulin dose between the semaglutide and control groups.

‚ÄúWhen we looked at total insulin dose per kilogram of body weight, there was a significant decrease [with tirzepatide], indicating that this went beyond just the loss of body weight and perhaps improved insulin sensitivity,‚Äù Snell-Bergeon said.

The change in BMI, body weight and HbA1c did not differ between adults receiving multiple daily insulin injections and those using an insulin pump. Snell-Bergeon said there was a trend toward greater HbA1c loss for adults receiving tirzepatide and using an insulin pump vs. semaglutide users or those using tirzepatide with multiple daily injections.

Dosing and safety

People using semaglutide began at a starting dose of 0.25 mg per week and were titrated up based on clinical guidelines. Of the group, 38 reached a maximum dose of 0.5 mg per week. For those using tirzepatide, the starting dose was 2.5 mg per week. Of the tirzepatide group, 16 reached a maximum dose of 5 mg, eight reached a maximum dose of 7.5 mg and 14 reached a maximum dose of 10 mg.

There were no reports of hospitalizations for DKA or hypoglycemia during the study. Three adults using semaglutide and one using tirzepatide discontinued the medication due to lack of response.

Snell-Bergeon said randomized controlled trials still need to be conducted to assess efficacy and safety outcomes for both medications among adults with type 1 diabetes.

Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is now an approved frontline treatment for patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma.

The FDA approved the frontline combination of pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and chemotherapy in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma. This approval is supported by findings from the 2/3 KEYNOTE-483 trial (NCT02784171). Here, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the firstline led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) vs chemotherapy alone.

The FDA has granted approval to the first-line treatment of pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma.

Data from the randomized, open-label, phase 2/3 KEYNOTE-483 trial (NCT02784171) support this approval. According to findings presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, the combination of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy led to a statistically significant improvement in OS, reducing the risk of death by 21% (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.98; 2-sided P =.0324). The median OS with the combination was 17.3 months (95% CI, 14.4-21.3) vs 16.1 months (95% CI, 13.1-18.2) with chemotherapy alone.

A significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) was also observed with the combination. The PFS was 7.13 months (HR, 0.80; 95%CI, 0.65-0.99; 2-sided P =.0372) with the combination vs 7.16 months with chemotherapy, and at 12 months, the estimated PFS rates across arms were 26% and 17%, respectively. The overall response rate (ORR) was also significantly higher for the pembrolizumab combination at 62% vs 38% with chemotherapy alone (P <.0001).

For safety, the safety profile of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in this study was consistent with what has been previously reported.

Those with measurable disease; an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; and adequate hematologic, liver, and renal function and those who had no contraindications to standard chemotherapy were eligible for enrollment in the study. Patients must have also been eligible to receive standard chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin and must have been incurable with use of standard therapies to be included in the study. Patients were permitted to have had prior radiation at least 28 days prior to registration; however, radiation to the thorax was not allowed unless clear disease progression was seen. Further, patients were permitted to have undergone previous major surgery at least 28 days prior to registration.

There were 440 patients enrolled during the phase 3 portion and randomized to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab given intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles in combination with 500 mg/m2 of pemetrexed every 3 weeks for 6 cycles and 75 mg/m2 of cisplatin every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Patients also could have been given pemetrexed plus cisplatin alone. Cisplatin could be substituted with carboplatin at an area under the curve of 5 or 6 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles in either arm.

Key takeaways:

* The antiviral reduced the risk for severe symptoms of COVID-19, need for health care and time off of work after recovery.
* The trial may inform future studies on treatment and prevention of long COVID.

The antiviral molnupiravir modestly reduces the risk for severe symptoms of COVID-19 and may also reduce the risk for long COVID, according to a randomized controlled trial.

In 2021, the MOVe-OUT trial demonstrated that molnupiravir ‚Äî one of three antivirals available to treat COVID-19 in the United States ‚Äî reduced the risk for hospitalization or death from COVID-19 by around half among unvaccinated participants.

In contrast, the PANORAMIC trial showed that molnupiravir did not reduce the risk for hospitalization from COVID-19 among vaccinated adults, but did speed recovery by 4 days, the authors of the new analysis noted.

In a follow-up to PANORAMIC, researchers randomly assigned more than 25,000 adults to receive either molnupiravir plus usual care (12,821) or only usual care (12,962) between Dec. 8, 2021, and April 27, 2022. Participants were aged at least 50 years or at least 18 years with a comorbidity, and 99.1% had received a previous dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

The researchers found that vaccinated participants treated with the antiviral experienced fewer and less severe COVID-19 symptoms, accessed health care less often and took less time off work 6 months after recovery, ‚Äúbut with small effect sizes‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh numbers needed to treat.‚Äù

Specifically, among participants in the treatment arm, molnupiravir was associated with a 1.9% reduction in severity of any severe symptoms and a 2.5% reduction in severity of persistent symptoms after 6 months. The number of participants needed to treat to achieve the benefit were 52.6 and 40, respectively.

‚ÄúThe promising results from the PANORAMIC trial are consistent with results from well-conducted observational analyses as they both converge on finding a modest effect of molnupiravir in reducing the risk of long COVID in high-risk individuals,‚Äù Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development services at Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System, wrote in a commentary published with the study.

We asked Al-Aly, who was not involved in the trial, about the significance of the findings for COVID-19 treatment and the prevention of long COVID. His answers have been lightly edited for clarity.

Healio: What stuck out to you in the results of the study?

Al-Aly: I have been waiting for the results of this large, randomized study. It clearly shows that molnupiravir reduced the risk of several important outcomes. The effect size is small, but not negligible.

Healio: What‚Äôs the bottom line on antivirals and long COVID?

Al-Aly: As it stands, the current evidence suggests that antivirals have an effect in reducing the risk of long COVID. This is evident in PANORAMIC (molnupiravir) and a study on ensitrelvir, another antiviral from Japan. It is also clear from these studies that the effect size is small ‚Äî meaning that we cannot solely rely on antivirals to completely prevent long COVID.

Healio: What should clinicians take from these findings?

Al-Aly: In high-risk individuals, antivirals reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 illness and may also reduce the risk of long COVID. They remain massively underutilized. Clinicians should be cognizant of adverse events, drug-drug interactions (for example, with Paxlovid), and the mutagenic potential of molnupiravir (it induces mutations in SARS-CoV-2). But they should also consider potential benefits.

Healio: What do you hope they take away from your related commentary?

Al-Aly: The PANORAMIC results suggest that blocking viral replication in the acute phase ‚Äî via molnupiravir ‚Äî reduced the risk of long Covid. This is an important clue ‚Äî that hitting the virus early, diminishing its ability to replicate and suppressing viral load may hold promise in preventing long COVID. We need to continue to investigate the role of antivirals in preventing and treating long COVID and figure out ways to optimize their effectiveness. Trials to test combinations of antivirals, longer duration of treatment, etc., should be pursued.

=============================================================================

This decision comes after the company submitted a complete response to the regulator.

September 18, 2024

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has lifted the partial clinical hold on Vigil Neuroscience‚Äôs Phase I trial of VG-3927, a novel treatment under development for neurodegenerative diseases.

This decision follows a complete response submitted to the regulator by the company.

The Phase I trial has now expanded to include Alzheimer‚Äôs disease patients.

In July this year, Vigil Neuroscience shared interim findings from the single- and multiple-ascending dose study of VG-3927 in healthy subjects.

The safety and tolerability data from six SAD and two MAD cohorts indicated that VG-3927 is suitable for further clinical exploration.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile also supported the potential of the asset for once-daily dosing.

In addition, VG-3927 has shown promising signs of efficacy, including a sustained decline in soluble TREM2 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), providing clinical evidence of target engagement.

The ongoing Phase I trial has now expanded to include patients suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, some of whom have TREM2 or other disease-related genetic variations.

This cohort will help assess VG-3927‚Äôs biomarker response after a single dose.

Vigil Neuroscience aims to release the complete Phase I data, including results from the Alzheimer‚Äôs patient cohort, in the first quarter of next year.

VG-3927 is a small molecule TREM2 agonist and is being developed to address neurodegenerative diseases linked to microglial dysfunction, with an initial focus on treating Alzheimer‚Äôs.

Vigil Neuroscience chief medical officer Petra Kaufmann said: ‚ÄúWe are pleased with the resolution of the partial clinical hold, a decision that was supported by non-clinical and clinical data from our ongoing Phase I trial.

‚ÄúWhile the partial clinical hold did not delay the clinical development of VG-3927, the option to increase the exposure limit provides us the best opportunity to explore the full pharmacology of VG-3927 as a potentially novel, next-generation therapy for those living with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.‚Äù",gpt-4o-mini,placeholder_id_1
