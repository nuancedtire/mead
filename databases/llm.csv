Key takeaways:

* When a patient made a critical error in inhalation technique and/or had insufficient peak inspiratory flow, they had inhaler misuse.
* In the assessed study population, 82.3% used a minimum of one misused inhaler.

Inhaler misuse was high in hospitalized patients with COPD, with 69.4% of all inhalers at admission found to be misused, according to results published in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases: Journal of the COPD Foundation.

Ga—ël Grandmaison

‚ÄúAs a hospital physician, these findings prompt me to systematically evaluate the inhalers used by COPD patients, regardless of their reason for hospitalization,‚Äù Ga—ël Grandmaison, MD, assistant physician in internal medicine at University and Hospital of Fribourg in Switzerland, told Healio.

Data were derived from Grandmaison G, et al. Chronic Obstr Pulm Dis. 2024;doi:10.15326/jcopdf.2024.0505.

‚ÄúIn response to these findings, we have implemented a systematic and standardized assessment of inhaler use among our patients, aiming to correct inhalation techniques or replace the inhaler if necessary,‚Äù Grandmaison continued. ‚Äú[This intervention](https://smw.ch/index.php/smw/article/view/3394/5882) has significantly reduced the number of improperly used inhalers at hospital discharge.‚Äù

In a cross-sectional study, Grandmaison and colleagues evaluated 96 patients (mean age, 71.6 years; 63% men) in the internal medicine division of Fribourg Hospital with a diagnosis of COPD to find out how many patients in this population misuse inhalers via physiotherapist assessments and the In-Check Dial G16 (Alliance Tech Medical) over 9 months.

Researchers cited inhaler misuse when a patient made a critical error in inhalation technique and/or had insufficient peak inspiratory flow (PIF).

The total cohort had 160 inhalers, and nearly 70% (111 inhalers) had been misused. In the entire study population, 82.3% of patients used a minimum of one misused inhaler.

‚ÄúNumerous studies have highlighted the significant issue of improper inhaler use in outpatient settings,‚Äù Grandmaison said. ‚ÄúOur study confirms that this problem is also widespread.‚Äù

A critical error in inhalation technique was behind more instances of inhaler misuse than insufficient PIF (105 inhalers; 65.6% vs. 22 inhalers; 13.8%), and this was also reflected in the proportions of patients who used a minimum of one inhaler with a critical error (81.3%) and had insufficient PIF (21.9%).

In an effort to determine if targeted teaching can change the prevalence of inhaler misuse, researchers had physiotherapists carry out up to three teaching sessions and reassessed the number of inhalers with critical errors after each one.

With each additional session, fewer inhalers had been used with critical errors (one session, 33 inhalers; two sessions, 15 inhalers; three sessions, nine inhalers).

Five patients had cognitive disorders that inhibited them from reaching an adequate inhalation technique, according to researchers. A lack of coordination between inhaler activation and inspiration (n = 4) was another factor preventing adequate inhalation technique, followed by fine motor disorders and the inability to hold one‚Äôs breath sufficiently (each n = 2).

Researchers further assessed how many inhalers were unsuitable, meaning they ‚Äúcannot be used optimally, either because of an insufficient PIF or because of an inability to use an inhaler optimally despite specific teaching,‚Äù and found 27 (16.9%). Use of at least one unsuitable inhaler was noted in 25% of the study population.

‚ÄúSuboptimal inhaler use is associated with poor disease control, more frequent hospitalizations and increased costs,‚Äù Grandmaison told Healio. ‚ÄúThe prevalence of improperly-used inhalers is alarming, and strategies to address this issue are urgently needed.‚Äù

Among those hospitalized with a COPD exacerbation, 62.2% of the inhalers in this subgroup had been misused, whereas in the group of those hospitalized without an exacerbation, 85.7% of inhalers had been misused.

Additionally, those hospitalized for a respiratory compliant misused 65.9% of the inhalers in this subgroup, which was lower than the 82.4% of misused inhalers in the group not hospitalized for a respiratory compliant.

‚ÄúThese results underscore the critical importance of assessing inhalation technique and providing appropriate therapeutic education,‚Äù Grandmaison told Healio. ‚ÄúThey also highlight the need to evaluate a patient‚Äôs inspiratory capacity and ensure that the chosen inhaler matches their specific needs.‚Äù

With both this study and the study mentioned above on the intervention that lowered the number of improperly used inhalers at discharge completed, Grandmaison plans to continue researching the intervention.

‚ÄúThe next step is to evaluate the impact of such an intervention on symptom control and disease progression,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAdditionally, our goal is to adapt the strategy developed in our department for use in outpatient care.‚Äù

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","Groundbreaking lipid profiling uncovers how plant-based fats dramatically enhance heart and metabolic health, paving the way for precise dietary interventions.

A recent research briefing published in the journal _Nature Medicine_ reported associations between dietary fat quality and cardiometabolic risk.

The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks the evidence for the health benefits of substituting specific nutrients for others (e.g., mono- and poly-unsaturated fats for saturated fat) as low to moderate. According to the WHO, the current dietary guidelines advocating for reduced consumption of saturated fats are based on evidence of moderate certainty but remain a topic of ongoing debate.

Besides, the main drawbacks of existing intervention trials assessing different dietary fat types are shorter durations and reliance on indirect measures, e.g., cholesterol, instead of clinical endpoints (incident type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular events). Furthermore, observational studies evaluating the health outcomes of lower saturated fat intake are prone to confounding and often do not report the effects of specific nutrient substitutions.

The study and findings

In the present briefing, researchers utilized extensive blood fat composition profiling in different types of studies and observed associations between dietary fat quality and cardiometabolic risks. They combined data from dietary intervention studies that precisely controlled the types and sources of dietary fats with long-term observational studies that monitored disease occurrence over extended periods.

The researchers conducted extensive blood lipid profiling and developed/validated a multi-lipid score (MLS). The score reflected the effects of an intervention on the concentrations of 45 lipid metabolites, serving as a surrogate for metabolic adaptation to dietary fat changes. This approach allowed them to evaluate the implications of altering dietary fat quality on cardiometabolic health more precisely. The team leveraged the MLS to assess the implications of changes in the quality of dietary fats on cardiometabolic health in population studies.

Further, subgroup-specific effects were analyzed in a long-term intervention trial. The differences in MLS, which aligned with the impact of substituting saturated dairy fat with plant-based unsaturated fat, were associated with a significantly lower incidence of type 2 diabetes (in a dietary intervention trial) and cardiovascular disease (in prospective cohort studies).

Persons with initially worse MLS exhibited a stronger decrease in diabetes risk when on a Mediterranean diet rich in plant-based unsaturated fats than those with favorable MLS. This finding highlights the importance of the initial metabolic state in determining the effectiveness of dietary interventions. Substituting saturated fats from dairy products, e.g., butter, with plant-based unsaturated fats could result in substantially reduced cardiometabolic risks.

Conclusions

The study contributes important evidence supporting the current guidelines on the optimal source and quality of dietary fat but also underscores ongoing debates and limitations in the existing evidence base. The researchers addressed previous limitations of evidence underlying these guidelines by integrating randomized controlled trials and observational studies. The findings highlight the cardiometabolic benefits of replacing saturated fat from dairy products with unsaturated fat from plant products.

The authors said, ‚ÄúThe enthusiasm our work has generated encourages us to apply omics profiles for integrating data from cohorts and trials to other nutrition research questions.‚Äù However, they cautioned that their multi-study strategy is not without limitations.

While this multi-study approach addressed previous research biases, the team did not perform independent studies to establish thresholds for decision-making, examine cost-effectiveness, and validate absolute effect sizes on all metabolites. However, they cautioned that their multi-study strategy is not without limitations.

Additionally, the observed associations need validation in diverse racial and ethnic groups, as the study populations were primarily of European descent. Overall, the findings open avenues for more precise targeted interventions of dietary fat quality through lipid profiling. However, the application of lipidomics scores for dietary risk prevention requires further validation in future randomized controlled trials, particularly in more diverse populations.

===============================================================================

September 4, 2024

By Joshua Fitch, Senior Editor

Alan Percy, MD, discussed what the FDA approval of trofinetide (Daybue) has meant to patients with Rett syndrome aged 2 years and older.

Alan Percy, MD, Professor of Pediatrics, Neurology, Neurobiology, Genetics, and Psychology at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and the lead author for the LILAC-1 and LILAC-2 studies, recently discussed significant advancements in the treatment of Rett syndrome, highlighting the FDA approval of trofinetide (Daybue; Acadia Pharmaceuticals), approved on March 13, 2023. Percy also discussed the recent long-term safety data for trofinetide, based on a pair of open-label extension studies LILAC-1 and LILAC-2.

""Actually, it's quite interesting that while there is great enthusiasm among parents of children, the survival in Rett syndrome is quite long. So average survival is over age 50. So, many adult women with Rett syndrome are also taking this medication,"" Percy explained, noting the trofinetide approval marked a significant milestone in the direct management of Rett syndrome symptoms.

Percy emphasized the groundbreaking nature of this treatment, noting that ""this was the first product that was ever has been developed and approved by the FDA for direct treatment of the signs or symptoms of Rett syndrome. Other medications we use are for symptomatic care, but nothing has been available previously to direct at the basic underpinnings of Rett syndrome.""

The pivotal trial for this treatment, known as the LAVENDER trial, was a ""double-blind, placebo-controlled study lasting 12 weeks,"" Percy explained. The trial utilized the Rett Syndrome Behavioral Questionnaire (RSBQ) and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) as primary endpoints to measure the treatment's effectiveness. ""What is quite remarkable is at the end of the first pivotal trial, 12 weeks both the RSBQ and the CGI-I showed improvement.""

LILAC-1 was a 40-week, open-label extension of the LAVENDER trail and evaluated safety and efficacy of trofinetide in patients with Rett syndrome aged 5 to 21 years. LILAC-2 was a 32-month open-label extension evaluating trofinetide in females aged 5 to 22 years who had completed LILAC-1, according to Acadia Pharmaceuticals.

The most common side effects in the trials were diarrhea and vomiting.

Percy acknowledged that while the treatment shows significant promise, it is not without challenges. ""I think it is important to mention that diarrhea can be a substantial problem, and there may be individuals who have to stop the treatment simply because the diarrhea is not manageable."" However, he pointed out that strategies have been developed over time to manage this side effect more effectively. ""We start at 50% of the recommended weight-based dose, and we gradually increase to the point of maximum tolerability.""

Vaxcyte, Inc has announced positive topline results from its Phase 1/2 study of VAX-31, a 31-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) candidate. The study, which involved 1,015 adults aged 50 and older, found that VAX-31 was well tolerated and elicited strong opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) immune responses for all 31 serotypes evaluated. Notably, VAX-31 met or exceeded regulatory immunogenicity standards for all 31 serotypes at middle and high doses, showing significant improvements over Prevnar 20 (PCV20) for several serotypes.

‚ÄúWe are exceptionally proud to share these results, which we believe validate VAX-31‚Äôs potential as a best-in-class pneumococcal vaccine capable of raising the bar for immunogenicity standards,‚Äù said Jim Wassil, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Vaxcyte. ‚ÄúThe public health community continues to highlight the need for broader-protection vaccines to prevent IPD, which is associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and meningitis. To address this need, VAX-31 was designed to increase coverage to more than 95% of IPD circulating in adults 50 and older in the United States, with the potential to provide significantly greater coverage relative to today‚Äôs standard-of-care adult PCVs.‚Äù1

### Main Takeaways

1.  Vaxcyte‚Äôs VAX-31 vaccine showed strong immune responses and was well tolerated in a Phase 1/2 study of 1,015 adults aged 50 and older.
2.  VAX-31 met or exceeded immunogenicity standards for all 31 serotypes and demonstrated superior responses compared to Prevnar 20 for several serotypes.
3.  Vaxcyte plans to advance VAX-31 to a Phase 3 trial by mid-2025 and initiate a Phase 2 infant study to offer broader protection against pneumococcal disease.

The randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding study compared three dosage levels of VAX-31 to PCV20, assessing its safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity over six months. Results showed that VAX-31 at the high and middle doses met non-inferiority criteria for all 20 common serotypes with PCV20, and demonstrated statistically superior immune responses for several serotypes. The vaccine also met superiority criteria for 11 additional serotypes unique to VAX-31.

[Back in February](https://www.contagionlive.com/view/vaxcyte-completes-enrollment-for-its-phase-1-2-trial-for-innovative-pneumococcal-vaccine-vax-31), Vaxcyte completed enrollment for the Phase 1/2 trial of VAX-31, a 31-valent PCV designed to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding study, which involves 1,015 participants, is evaluating three dosage levels of VAX-31 compared to PCV20.

Streptococcus pneumoniae causes PD, leads to severe infections such as meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia. It results in around 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the US The World Health Organization and the CDC classify Streptococcus pneumoniae as a top antibiotic-resistant threat. It is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in children under five and causes over 50% of bacterial meningitis cases in the US The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains highlights the urgent need for a more effective vaccine.

Looking ahead, Vaxcyte plans to advance VAX-31 into a Phase 3 program, with a pivotal non-inferiority study set to begin by mid-2025. Additionally, a Phase 2 study of VAX-31 in infants is planned for early 2025. VAX-31 aims to provide broader protection against pneumococcal disease, potentially covering more than 95% of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) strains in adults. As a novel 31-valent PCV, it represents a significant advancement in pneumococcal vaccination, seeking to enhance coverage and efficacy beyond current standard vaccines.

[FDA Briefs|September 2024 Brief](https://www.targetedonc.com/fda-briefs/september-2024-brief)

The FDA has approved FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx as companion diagnostics to be used with olaparib, abiraterone, and prednisone or prednisolone BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Two prostate cancer cells in the final stage of cell division: ¬©PRB ARTS - stock.adobe.com

*   **The FDA has approved the FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx as companion diagnostics for the combination of olaparib (Lynparza) and abiraterone (Zytiga) with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with _BRCA_\-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).**
*   **This approval follows 2 previous approvals of the FoundationOne CDx as companion diagnostics for olaparib in mCRPC.**
*   **The availability of tissue- and liquid-based diagnostic tools provides greater access to genomic testing for patients.**

The FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx have been approved by the FDA for companion use with olaparib, abiraterone, and prednisone or prednisolone in patients with _BRCA_\-mutated mCRPC.1

‚ÄúThis approval reinforces the importance of testing for genomic mutations at metastatic diagnosis to help guide treatment decisions,‚Äù said Mia Levy, MD, PhD, chief medical officer at Foundation Medicine, in a press release. ‚ÄúOur high-quality tissue and liquid biopsy companion diagnostic tests will allow more patients to access genomic testing, regardless of specimen type, and will simplify complex decisions by generating the best information to enable better decision-making. There is a critical unmet need for first-line treatment options for patients with _BRCA_\-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and this combination therapy is an important advancement.‚Äù

This approval marks Foundation Medicine‚Äôs seventh FDA-approved companion diagnostic in prostate cancer. In May 2020, the FDA approved the FoundationOne CDx in patients with homologous recombination repair gene-mutated mCRPC who had progressed following treatment with enzalutamide (Xtandi) or abiraterone.2 In November 2020, the [**Liquid CDx was approved as a companion diagnostic**](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/foundationone-liquid-cdx-receives-expanded-fda-indication-in-metastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer) for olaparib to identify patients with mCRPC harboring _BRCA1, BRCA2_, or _ATM_ alterations.3

The FoundationOne companion diagnostics can analyze over 300 cancer-related genes using either blood or tissue samples. The approval of both tissue- and blood-based diagnostic tools provides greater access and flexibility for patients to benefit from genomic testing, particularly with the poor prognosis associated with _BRCA_\-mutated mCRPC.1

‚ÄúThis is an important milestone for men with aggressive prostate cancer,‚Äù said Courtney Bugler, president and chief executive officer of ZERO Prostate Cancer, in the press release. ‚ÄúBiomarker testing is an important tool for patients and families to help facilitate personalized treatment decision making, and we applaud Foundation Medicine for these additional companion diagnostic indications.‚Äù

==========================================================================

With 1k new patients a month, the company has almost quadrupled its revenue in one year
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UK-based healthtech Doccla has secured a ¬£35m Series B, led by European VC Lakestar, with new investors French VC Elaia and existing investors General Catalyst, Speedinvest and the investment leg of German media company Bertelsmann also participating.

Having almost quadrupled its annual revenue in 2023, it's planning its expansion in DACH and France, and says its German and French investors will help its international growth plans.

The startup, founded in 2019, makes ‚Äúvirtual ward‚Äù technology for healthcare providers. It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.

Doccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland‚Äôs Health Service Executive (HSE).

Doccla‚Äôs founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.

‚ÄúWith the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it‚Äôs a huge opportunity to scale,‚Äù says Ratz.

#### The virtual A&E

Sweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.

According to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.

Patients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.

So far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it‚Äôs adding 1k new patients every month.

‚ÄúOver time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,‚Äù Ratz says.

#### Partnering with pharma

Doccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).

‚ÄúWe have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,‚Äù Ratz says. ‚ÄúThis is because we are in very close contact with our patients.‚Äù

Doccla says it‚Äôs interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he‚Äôs seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.

With 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.

In one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.

‚ÄúWe can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits ‚Äî in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,‚Äù Ratz says.

Doccla has raised a total of ¬£52m to date.

In October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.",gpt-4o-mini

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","Berlin-based Caresyntax, which is building an AI-driven data platform for surgery, has raised a $180m Series C extension.

The round is made up of $80m in equity and $100m in debt ‚Äî and is tied to specific milestones. The fresh funding tops up the startup‚Äôs $130m Series C, raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.

It‚Äôs the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.

Caresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.

### AI for hospitals

Caresyntax says it wants to build the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals‚Äô surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.

The company‚Äôs platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.

While some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax‚Äôs platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.

‚ÄúEffectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,‚Äù they add.

If it does what it sets out to do, it‚Äôs a big opportunity.

Costs associated with operations account for 30% of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends 11% of GDP on health.

Founded in 2013 in Germany ‚Äî Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 ‚Äî its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company‚Äôs revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.

### The rise of smart surgery

The round comes on the back of a strong 18 months for startups developing tech for the operating theatre.

Since the start of 2023, three of the four biggest medtech raises have all gone to startups building robots to help surgeons. The UK‚Äôs CMR Surgical picked up ¬£165m in September last year, Switzerland‚Äôs DistalMotion $150m in April 2023 and Italy‚Äôs Medical Microinstruments $110m in February this year.

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","The meteoric rise of a new class of weight loss drugs over the past two years, known as GLP-1s, has seen a new name take the title of Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, helped a country dodge a recession and hit grocery sales in the US.

The valuations of the companies that make this so-called ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù class of drugs ‚Äî which includes Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and US rival Eli Lilly (maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) ‚Äî have soared as investors bet big on a medication projected by some to hit $150bn in sales by the early 2030s.

The potential of the market has not been lost on founders.

It‚Äôs a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù opportunity, says Kai Eberhardt, the founder and CEO of Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform which operates in the UK, France and Germany, alongside its home market. It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.

‚ÄúFor us [GLP-1 drugs] are already a strong growth driver,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.‚Äù

While treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva‚Äôs overall business ‚Äî Eberhardt says it‚Äôs growing total patient and revenue numbers by ‚Äúdouble digit‚Äù percentage points year-on-year ‚Äî the meds could become the startup‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest‚Äù growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.

### Riding the wave

Oviva‚Äôs not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity ‚Äî many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.

In the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart‚Äôs CEO, food sales have fallen as the one in eight adults in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, propping up Denmark‚Äôs GDP in the process.

All of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have convinced them to get out their chequebook: Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a ‚Ç¨10m Series A in August 2023 a year on from a ‚Ç¨3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised ‚Ç¨3.1m last summer.

Many startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn‚Äôt start life offering them ‚Äî largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.

UK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs health‚Äù brand, but has recently changed that. The company‚Äôs website uses images of men and women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.

Yazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.

Meurling tells Sifted it had hit ‚Ç¨14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It‚Äôs now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.

Other startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men‚Äôs sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.

‚Äú[GLP-1 meds] are a game changer,‚Äù says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be ‚Äústrange‚Äù if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn‚Äôt looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.

While GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the ‚Äúhype‚Äù surrounding the drug class has ‚Äúopened doors‚Äù for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler ‚Äî adding that the startup managed to raise its ‚Ç¨400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It‚Äôs now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it‚Äôll look to target US employers ‚Äî who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.

### Kinks in the supply chain

There are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector ‚Äî not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.

Some of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate‚Äôs $100m in 2021 and Form Health‚Äôs $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than ‚Ç¨10m in a single round.

Investors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics ‚Äî Manual was still selling past the deadline.

If a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.

‚ÄúAs there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.‚Äù

### Who‚Äôll stump up the cash?

There‚Äôs also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.

While Numan‚Äôs head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the ‚Äúsuccess of private sector companies offering GLP-1 [drugs] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS‚Äù, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won‚Äôt be enough to hit real scale.

‚ÄúUS investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts [selling to whole organisations like health insurers],‚Äù says Syhler. ‚ÄúThis means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care ‚Äî where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.‚Äù

In Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.

In the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.

Oviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS ‚Äî but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it‚Äôs in ‚Äúmature dialogues with several health systems‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,‚Äù says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that don‚Äôt always want to work with startups. Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.

Whether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen ‚Äî but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. ‚ÄúI've never been an investor in a company that‚Äôs got so much attention ‚Äî in a space that‚Äôs got so much attention,‚Äù says Arnardottir.",gpt-4o-mini

On Wednesday UK-based period tracking app Flo Health announced it had raised $200m ‚Äî pushing its valuation beyond $1bn and making it Europe‚Äôs first femtech unicorn.

It turned out to be a very buzzy story: as people were quick to point out online, Flo also became Europe‚Äôs first women‚Äôs health unicorn with an all-male founding team ‚Äî a detail which sparked a backlash online.

‚ÄúA company founded by men, led by men and funded by men became the first WOMEN'S health app to achieve unicorn status. If this doesn't show you everything that's wrong with the ecosystem, I don't know what will,‚Äù Anna-Sophie Hartvigsen, cofounder of investment learning app and community for women Female Invest, wrote in a viral LinkedIn post, citing stats on the lack of funding for female founders. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad that a femtech company is doing well,‚Äù she later added in the comments. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs bad that only men are able to succeed in this space.‚Äù

Some founders in the comments underneath Hartvigsen's post said that they‚Äôve struggled with fundraising as a woman; there was also a debate in a private WhatsApp group seen by Sifted about whether female founders should add a token male founder to their team in an effort to increase their chances of getting cheques. Someone in that group added that we won‚Äôt fix the trend of men funding men until there are more female investors.

But others didn‚Äôt see it that way.

‚ÄúThis achievement should actually be celebrated. As a women's health investor that has invested in 7+ women's health companies, we are yet to see any of them scale,‚Äù Deepali Nangia, a partner at Speedinvest, wrote in response to Hartvigsen‚Äôs LinkedIn post. ‚ÄúFlo's achievement is a very strong signal to the market that [direct to consumer] women's health is monetizable in Europe and that there is money to be made here; this is what investors need to see so more money flows into women's health companies. Not to say that the challenges faced by women in pitching are any less, but we must celebrate all wins that lead to more capital deployed into this sector,‚Äù she argued.

Nangia added that she wasn‚Äôt doubting there‚Äôs a problem, ‚Äúbut every win should not be turned around to a problem‚Ä¶ Many people have been working on solving for this problem, which includes many women of course but also men.‚Äù

Another commenter added: ‚ÄúIf anything, let this be a door for more investors to look closely at the female health industry and invest their money there? Could this be an example of men allies? If it had to be a company founded and led by men, well thank you very much for opening the door, now let the rest go through.‚Äù

Priya Oberoi, partner at women‚Äôs health-focused VC Goddess Gaia Ventures, added: ‚ÄúFlo reaching series C [unicorn] status with 60 mln active users is a win for #womenshealth - helping to close that 131 year gender health gap and getting products and services out there to improve the lives of women.‚Äù

""We firmly believe that women's health has been critically overlooked, undervalued and underfunded for far too long,"" Flo said in a statement to Sifted. ""Our sincere hope is that Flo‚Äôs funding will inspire more investors to recognise the immense potential in this space."" The company added: ""We're proud to say that more than half (56%) of Flo's employees are women, including our leadership team.""

It‚Äôs an important debate, and, readers, I‚Äôm curious to hear your thoughts: why aren‚Äôt there more female-founded femtech unicorns?

METHODOLOGY:
------------

* Investigators conducted a prospective cohort study among 61 general practitioners (GPs) in France, most of whom had not previously used the MoCA.
* The GPs administered the test to 221 patients aged 50 years and older (mean age, 66 years) without known impairment during routine consultations.
* The main outcome was MoCA feasibility, defined as completion in less than 15 minutes, the average time required to complete the alternate Mini Mental State Examination.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

* On an average, the GPs completed MoCA administration in just 8 minutes (range, 5-30 minutes).
* Fully, 82% of the tests were completed in 10 minutes and 97% in less than 15 minutes.
* On the basis of MoCA score, 62% of screened patients had mild cognitive impairment (18-25 points) and 4% had moderate cognitive impairment (10-17 points), while the rest had normal cognition.
* Most GPs reported that using the MoCA was a positive experience, in particular noting that it was easy and quick to use in daily practice.
* GP difficulties with the test were related to patient hearing loss, whereas patient difficulties were related to lack of concentration leading to misunderstanding of instructions.

IN PRACTICE:
------------

""This study confirms the quick and easy MoCA use during routine consultations in general practice to screen for early cognitive impairment from the age of 50,"" the authors wrote. The high prevalence of mild cognitive impairment found highlights ""the importance of early screening to promote early support for patients and their entourage,"" they added.

SOURCE:
-------

The study was led by Cassandre Carton, MD, University of Lille, Lille, France, and was published online in BJGP Open.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Limitations included the low participation rate, a lack of in-depth exploration of GPs' views of the MoCA, and administration of the test at a consultation selected by the GP.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

The study did not receive any funding. The authors reported no competing interests.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

A recent study found higher incidences of exposed bone and osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer who underwent dental extractions soon after radiotherapy, with the risk particularly elevated in those who received higher radiation doses.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Guidelines recommend removing nonrestorable teeth before radiation therapy to prevent osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer, but this can delay treatment by 2-4 weeks, potentially affecting overall survival. An alternative is to perform extractions after radiation, with a caveat that radiation can affect patients' oral health following an extraction.
*   Prospective data assessing outcomes among patients receiving extractions soon after radiation therapy ‚Äî when complications may be more minimal ‚Äî don't exist.
*   Researchers evaluated the safety of performing dental extractions within 4 months of radiation therapy and the associated risks for exposed bone and osteoradionecrosis.
*   The study included 50 patients with head and neck cancer, enrolled from January 2020 to September 2022.
*   The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of exposed bone; secondary outcomes were the incidence of osteoradionecrosis and adherence to recommended post-radiation extractions. The median follow-up period was 26 months.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   A total of 30 patients had between 1 and 28 extractions at a median of 64.5 days (range, 13-152 days) after therapy, while 20 patients declined extractions. Out of those who had extractions, 26 patients had them performed within the recommended 4-month window following radiation therapy.
*   Among all patients, 13 experienced an exposed bone event, 12 of which occurred in patients who had post-radiation extractions; 8 of 13 patients with exposed bone were later diagnosed with osteoradionecrosis.
*   The 2-year cumulative incidences of exposed bone were 27%, 40%, and 7% among all patients, those who underwent extractions, and those who declined extractions, respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidences of osteoradionecrosis were 18%, 23%, and 7% among all patients, those who underwent extractions, and those who declined extractions, respectively.
*   Among patients who received post-radiation extractions, a mean oral cavity dose ‚â• 35 Gy was associated with greater risk for exposed bone at 2 years (58%) and osteoradionecrosis (39%). An average mandible dose ‚â• 31.5 Gy produced similar results.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

Post-radiation extractions, even when performed soon after the completion of radiation therapy, are ""unsuitable for routine use,"" particularly at high oral cavity or mandibular doses, given the risk for exposed bone and osteoradionecrosis, the authors concluded.

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study, with Matthew C. Ward, MD, from Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Charlotte, North Carolina, was [published online](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2822270?) in _JAMA Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead & Neck Surgery_.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

The study had a small sample size, limited generalizability, and a short follow-up. Confounding factors could have affected the results.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The study funding source was not declared. Several authors received grants and personal fees outside this work.

TOPLINE:
--------

For people aged 75 years or older experiencing non‚ÄìST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), an invasive treatment strategy may not be better than a conservative one for a composite of cardiovascular death and non-fatal myocardial infarction.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   Prospective, multicenter, randomised SENIOR-RITA trial in the United Kingdom.
*   About 1518 patients aged ‚â• 75 years with NSTEMI were randomly assigned to the conservative strategy (best medical care) vs the invasive strategy (coronary angiography and revascularisation plus best medical care).
*   Frail patients and those with comorbidities were included.
*   The outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Median follow-up was 4.1 years.
*   There were no significant between-group differences in the primary outcome or cardiovascular death between the invasive strategy group and the conservative strategy group.
*   However, non-fatal myocardial infarction occurred in 11.7% of the invasive strategy group and 15.0% of the conservative strategy group, a significant difference (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-0.99).
*   In addition, over a 5-year period, invasive treatment resulted in, on average, 29 more days free from cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction than with conservative treatment.

IN PRACTICE:
------------

""Using contemporary angiography and interventional strategies, with the radial artery used as the access site in 89.3% of the patients, bleeding and procedure-related complications were minimal,"" the authors wrote.

SOURCE:
-------

The study was conducted by a UK-based team and was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Recruitment fell short of the goal of 1668 participants, with four in five screened participants not entering the trial. There were fewer outcome events than expected.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

The study was funded by the British Heart Foundation.

- A comprehensive study involving over 39,000 women aged 45+ years reveals no link between a history of migraine and an elevated risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD) over a follow-up of up to 22 years.
- Of the 685 women diagnosed with PD during this period, only 18.7% had a history of migraine, while 81.3% did not. This prompts a critical reflection on how we perceive the relationship between different health conditions.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

A history of migraine is not associated with an elevated risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) in women, regardless of headache frequency or migraine subtype, a new study suggests.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Researchers analyzed data on 39,312 women health professionals aged ‚â• 45 years and having no history of PD who enrolled in the Women's Health Study between 1992 and 1995 and were followed until 2021.
*   At baseline, 7321 women (18.6%) had migraine.
*   The mean follow-up duration was 22 years.
*   The primary outcome was a self-reported, physician-confirmed diagnosis of PD.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   During the study period, 685 women self-reported a diagnosis of PD.
*   Of these, 18.7% of reported cases were in women with any migraine and 81.3% in women without migraine.
*   No significant association was found between PD risk and a history of migraine, migraine subtypes (with or without aura), or migraine frequency.
*   Migraine was not associated with a higher risk for PD than nonmigraine headaches.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""These results are reassuring for women who have migraine, which itself causes many burdens, that they don't have to worry about an increased risk of Parkinson's disease in the future,"" study author Tobias Kurth, Charit√© - Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, said in a [press release](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1054724%3F).

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study was led by Ricarda S. Schulz, MSc, Charit√© - Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin. It was [published online](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209747) on August 21 in _Neurology_.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

The study's findings may not be generalizable to other populations, such as men and non-White individuals. The self-reported data on migraine and PD may be subject to inaccuracies. PD is often not diagnosed until symptoms have reached an advanced stage, potentially leading to cases being underreported. Changes in the status and frequency of migraine over the study period were not accounted for, which may have affected the results.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The authors did not disclose any specific funding for this work. The Women's Health Study was supported by the National Cancer Institute and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Two authors reported having financial ties outside this work. Full disclosures are available in the original article.

Alec Freyn, virology researcher at Moderna and co-first author, stated: ‚ÄúThis study is the first in a nonhuman primate model where we compare an investigational mRNA mpox vaccine directly to the current standard of care.‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúWhen we put those vaccines head-to-head in primates, we saw improved responses from the mRNA vaccine in terms of not just protection from survival but also fewer lesions, shorter duration of disease, and less viral shedding in the blood and respiratory tract.‚Äù

Originally designed to combat smallpox, MVA vaccines contained weakened whole viruses. Yet, this weakening means that they provide limited protection compared to other vaccines. The use of mRNA technology enables vaccines to be developed to only include parts of the virus that are most likely to induce a lasting, protective immune response without exposing the person to a whole infectious virus. The investigational mpox mRNA vaccine is composed of four viral antigens that are essential for the virus to attach and enter host cells.

Previous research has demonstrated that mRNA vaccines can prevent lethal mpox infections in nonhuman primates but their ability to lessen disease severity has not been tested. Therefore, to directly compare the investigational mRNA vaccine to MVA vaccines, the team vaccinated six macaques with each vaccine and then exposed them to a lethal strain of mpox virus eight weeks after their initial vaccine dose. Also, they exposed a control group of six unvaccinated animals to mpox. Then, after infection, the researchers monitored the macaque‚Äôs health for four weeks and collected blood samples to study their immune response.

Disease severity
----------------

Five of the unvaccinated control animals did not survive, whereas all 12 vaccinated animals did, regardless of which vaccine was used. The mRNA-vaccinated animals lost less weight and had fewer lesions than MVA-vaccinated animals, despite both vaccines limiting disease severity compared to the control group.

Furthermore, the mRNA vaccine shortened disease duration, measured by the number of days for which the animals showed lesions, by more than 10 days compared to the MVA vaccine. Lower viral loads were in the blood and throat swabs, indicating that it might be more effective at reducing transmission.

Jay Hooper, virologist at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and senior author explained: ‚ÄúWith the mRNA technology, we‚Äôre able to produce a vaccine that gives quite potent responses with a very tolerable safety profile‚Ä¶We‚Äôve been trying to get a vaccine that will prevent spread like ACAM2000¬Æ but without the safety issues. This is showing that mRNA technology might be able to fill that niche.‚Äù

Immune response
---------------

The mRNA vaccine resulted in a higher number of antibodies and antibodies with more diverse immune functions. Different classes of antibodies that were associated with enhanced viral control and fewer lesions were identified.

Furthermore, the vaccine demonstrated potential to induce cross-immunity to other Orthopoxviruses, whereas the MVA vaccine results in smaller immune responses that are not as strongly neutralising for more remotely related Orthopoxviruses. Serum from the macaques immunised with the mRNA vaccine ‚Äúneutralised not only mpox but also vaccinia, cowpox, rabbitpox, camelpox, and ectromelia virus,‚Äù Freyn said. ‚ÄúWe believe that this vaccine may protect from other Orthopoxvirus threats that may emerge in the future.‚Äù

Now, Moderna‚Äôs mRNA-1769 vaccine is being assessed in a Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT05995275) to determine the safety, tolerability and immune response of a range of doses of mRNA-1769.

The headline result from the MATINEE trial of IL-5 inhibitor Nucala (mepolizumab) in adults with COPD was a statistically significant reduction in the annualised rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared to placebo that GSK said was ""clinically meaningful."" In the study, Nucala was added to inhaled maintenance therapy for COPD.

GSK has been studying Nucala in COPD for some time, and in 2017 reported mixed results for the drug in two earlier phase 3 trials called METREX and METREO.

METREX involved patients with a range of eosinophil levels and showed a statistically significant improvement for Nucala versus placebo on exacerbation rates. However, in METREO ‚Äì which focused on patients with higher levels only ‚Äì the difference between the two arms was not significant.

The company decided to file for approval regardless, but the FDA declined to approve the new indication in 2018, following the advice of an advisory committee, which found that GSK had not proved efficacy. It seems MATINEE will allow GSK to try its luck again.

The size of the improvement over placebo ‚Äì which reportedly extended for up to two years in the trial ‚Äì won't be available until the study is presented at a future medical congress, but is strong enough to warrant discussions with regulators about extending the indications for Nucala, according to the pharma group. It has previously suggested approval for COPD could come in the US in the first half of next year.

Nucala has been approved to treat severe eosinophilic asthma for almost a decade, and in the interim has had its label extended to include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome.

The drug remains one of GSK's top products, with sales of ¬£856 million ($1.1 billion) in the first half of this year, up 15%. COPD could open up a massive new market for the drug, which still has several years of patent life left before it could face biosimilar competition.

The lung disease affects more than 300 million people globally, with up to 40 of patients exhibiting type 2 inflammation characterised by a raised blood eosinophil count, which would make them suitable for treatment with Nucala.

Elevated eosinophil levels are associated with more severe COPD and a higher rate of exacerbations, the sudden flare-ups in symptoms that signal the progression of the disease and can lead to hospitalisation.

The MATINEE data comes at a time when options for COPD are on the up, after a decade with no new therapies.

In July, the European Commission became the first regulator worldwide to approve Sanofi and Regeneron's big-selling IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor Dupixent (dupilumab) as a treatment for the progressive lung disease, shortly after Verona Pharma got the go-ahead from the US FDA for its PDE 3/4 inhibitor Ohtuvayre (ensifentrine).

Dupixent ‚Äì which is due for a verdict from the FDA as a COPD therapy later this month ‚Äì was cleared for adults with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils, while Ohtuvayre can be used in all patients regardless of eosinophil levels.",gpt-4o-mini

- Patients treated with lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) showed improved response rates, highlighting its effectiveness even among those with high-risk features like unmutated IGHV or TP53 mutations. This contradicts previous assumptions that high-risk patients would benefit less from such therapies.
- üìä Objective response rates (ORR) varied between patient subgroups: 41.5% in unmutated IGHV patients versus 63.2% in those with mutated IGHV. Similarly, for those with 17p deletions, the ORR was 47.1%, indicating robust outcomes across different risk profiles.
- Notably, patients with less tumor burden and fewer prior treatment lines experienced better responses‚Äî54.5% ORR in those with 3 or fewer lines of treatment compared to 44.6% in those with more than 3 lines.

- Risk factors like inflammatory markers and lower creatinine clearance rates were linked to increased neurological toxicity, which merits careful monitoring post-treatment.

William G. Wierda, MD, PhD, emphasized the potential for better outcomes when aiming for a less refractory patient population or employing debulking strategies before liso-cel treatment.

Response outcomes with liso-cel were consistent regardless of the presence of high-risk disease features in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) saw improved response outcomes with lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel; Breyanzi) which were consistent regardless of high-risk disease features. Further, lower tumor burden and fewer lines of prior treatment may have correlated with better responses, according to post hoc analysis findings from the phase 1/2 TRANSCEND CLL 004 trial (NCT03331198) presented at the 2024 Society of Hematologic Oncology Annual Meeting (SOHO).

Among patients with unmutated IGHV (n = 41) and those without (n = 19), the objective response rate (ORR) with liso-cel was 41.5% vs 63.2%, respectively (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.13-1.27), and the complete response (CR) rates were 22.0% vs 21.1% (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.28-3.98). For patients with 17p deletions (n = 34) and those without (n = 51), the ORR was 47.1% vs 45.1% (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.45-2.58), and the respective CR rates were 26.5% vs 13.7% (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 0.75-6.82). Additionally, for patients with TP53-mutated disease (n = 36) and those without (n = 50), data showed an ORR of 41.7% vs 50.0% (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.30-1.69) and CR rates of 22.2% vs 16.0% (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.50-4.46).

The ORR for patients with 17p deletions plus TP53 mutations (n = 25) and those without (n = 60) was 44.0% vs 46.7%, respectively (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.35-2.30). The CR rates in each group were 28.0% vs 15.0% (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 0.72-6.78). For patients with complex karyotype (n = 52) and those without (n = 34), the ORR was 44.2% vs 52.9% (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.30-1.68), and the CR rates were 19.2% vs 17.6% (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.36-3.40). Patient age did not appear to influence the likelihood of a response.

The median number of prior lines of therapy was 4 (IQR, 3-6) for patients with a response (n = 41) compared with 6 (IQR, 4-8) among those without a response (n = 46). Investigators reported that the ORR was 54.5% (95% CI, 32.2%-75.6%) among patients with a maximum of 3 prior lines of treatment (n = 22) and 44.6% (95% CI, 32.3%-57.5%) in those with more than 3 prior lines (n = 65; OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.56-3.93).

Study treatment yielded an ORR of 63.2% (95% CI, 46.0%-78.2%) for patients without bulky disease (n = 38) compared with 31.7% (95% CI, 18.1%-48.1%) in those with bulky disease (n = 41; OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.46-9.37). The mean sum of the product of perpendicular diameters (SPD) was 21.5 U/L (95% CI, 15.6-29.7) in patients with a CR (n = 14) compared with 40.9 U/L (95% CI, 34.1-49.1) in those who did not achieve a CR (n = 65). Additionally, patients who achieved a CR (n = 14) had a mean Œ≤-2 microglobulin level of 3.4 U/L (95% CI, 2.8-4.2) vs 5.4 U/L (95% CI, 4.5-6.5) in those without a CR (n = 61).

‚ÄúOne of the more important features of these data and analysis is that patients did respond, including those who had high-risk features [such as] unmutated [IGHV], 17p deletion, TP53 mutations, and complex karyotype. Better outcomes in terms of achieving response were seen in patients who had a lower bulk of disease,‚Äù William G. Wierda, MD, PhD, said in the presentation. ‚ÄúOverall, I believe that these data support an expectation and anticipation that better outcomes would be seen with this strategy in looking at a less refractory population of patients who are earlier in the course of their disease and/or looking at strategies to debulk the disease prior to [treatment with] liso-cel.‚Äù

Wierda is from the Department of Leukemia in the Division of Cancer Medicine at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

In the open-label, multicenter TRANSCEND CLL 004 study, patients underwent lymphodepletion with fludarabine at 30 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide at 300 mg/m2 for 3 days prior to treatment with liso-cel at a recommended phase 2 dose of 100 x 106 CAR-positive T cells.

For this post hoc analysis, investigators assessed how pretreatment variables such as demographic features, disease characteristics, and biomarker lab tests correlated with response and safety outcomes following treatment. Efficacy end points included the ORR and CR rates. Safety end points included any grade and grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurological events.

Patients 18 years and older with relapsed/refractory CLL or SLL and disease progression on or ineligibility for prior Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors were able to enroll on the trial. Other requirements for study entry included having an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and adequate bone marrow, organ, and cardiac function.

Of 87 patients in the full efficacy-evaluable population, the median age was 65 years (IQR, 59-69), and the median number of prior lines of therapy was 5 (IQR, 4-7). Additionally, most patients had Rai stage III or IV disease at screening (51%). In terms of risk factors, patients presented with unmutated IGHV (47%), 17p deletions (39%), TP53-mutated disease (41%), and complex karyotype (60%).

Any-grade neurological events affected 46% of patients, and 20% had events that were grade 3 or higher. Of note, the mean SPD was 49.1 cm2 (95% CI, 40.7-59.2) in patients with any neurological event (n = 38) and 27.7 cm2 (95% CI, 21.6-35.7) in those without any neurological events (n = 41). Additionally, the mean C-reactive protein level was 16.6 mg/L (95% CI, 9.6-28.5) in patients with neurological toxicity (n = 38) compared with 5.1 mg/L (95% CI, 3.5-7.5) in those without (n = 47).

Any-grade neurological events occurred in 53.3% (95% CI, 26.6%-78.7%) of patients with an estimated creatine clearance (CrCl) rate of less than 60 mL per minute (n = 15) compared with 43.7% (95% CI, 31.9%-56.0%) in those with an estimated CrCl rate of 60 mL per minute or higher (n = 71; OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.48-4.51). Additionally, grade 3 or higher neurological toxicity was reported in 46.7% (95% CI, 21.3-73.4%) and 14.1% (95% CI, 7.0-24.4%) in each respective group (OR, 5.34; 95% CI, 1.58-18.00).

Overall, Wierda noted that inflammatory markers, bulky disease, and lower estimated CrCl rates may increase the risk of neurological toxicity following treatment with liso-cel.

Europe's billionaires are taking a growing interest in expensive full-body-scans ‚Äî and startups are popping up all over Europe offering them

This article first appeared in Sifted‚Äôs Daily newsletter, sign up here.

Earlier this week, I visited one of Paris‚Äô few longevity clinics dedicated to preventative medicine ‚Äî and the only one that describes itself as a tech startup.

Hidden behind an unassuming Haussmannian door, just a few minutes away from the Paris Opera, the centre has been operating for nine months. The startup behind it, Zoƒ´, promises customers a ‚Äú360-degree check-up‚Äô ‚Äî a three-hour series of tests and exams, ranging from blood tests to eye scans through spirometry and gut microbiome analyses.

The objective? Collect millions of data points on up to 200 biomarkers that are in turn analysed by an AI model, in order to deliver lifestyle recommendations that, promises Zoƒ´, will prevent disease and improve customers‚Äô long-term wellness.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about adding years of life, but rather life to years,‚Äù says Zoƒ´ cofounder ‚Äî and former special advisor to French president Emmanuel Macron ‚Äî Isma√´l Em√©lien. ‚ÄúThe goal is to learn the body‚Äôs ‚Äòuser manual‚Äô to prevent illnesses and enable people to live in good health for longer.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not for everyone. Membership to Zoƒ´ is ‚Ç¨3.6k per year, which includes an annual checkup as well as the follow-up recommendations. That‚Äôs roughly the cost of a membership to Soho House, says Zoƒ´'s CFO Antoine Attali ‚Äî and the startup's customers usually belong to the same social circles.

The clinic caters to premium needs, from snacks elaborated by world-famous chef Alain Ducasse to a balneotherapy section modelled on ‚ÄòJapanese thermal baths‚Äò, featuring a snow cabin (?) and a mineral bath that is, I am told, ‚Äútwice as salty as the Dead Sea‚Äù.

Attali tells me that in the long-term, Zoƒ´ hopes to become accessible to everyone, and that prices will go down to a similar level to your average WiFi subscription.

For now, though, preventative health remains a hobby of the upper-class. In fact, Zoƒ´'s investors are all private individuals; the company‚Äôs ‚Ç¨20m seed round, which it raised in 2022, included a good number of high-profile billionaires such as Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saad√© and Moderna CEO St√©phane Bancel.

And Zoƒ´ is not the only longevity startup appealing to the ultra-rich. Spotify founder Daniel Ek is behind similar ventures, including Sand Clinic in Stockholm, where customers can receive full body check-ups and treatments ranging from vacuum therapy to red light saunas ‚Äî with membership expected to cost between ‚Ç¨1,000 and ‚Ç¨10,000 a month.

Ek is also the founder of healthtech Neko Health, which has built a full-body scanner for health data collection that it says helps doctors detect potential diseases earlier. The company has a clinic in Stockholm and has just opened a new spot in London, right in the middle of Marylebone, where it prices a one-hour scan at ¬£299 ‚Äî almost double the price of a visit to the Stockholm clinic when it opened in 2023 (‚Ç¨180).

Despite the cost, the proposition seems appealing enough. Neko Health says it already has a waiting list of 22k people; Zoƒ´ says it has ‚Äúaround 1k members‚Äù to date and is currently carrying out a dozen check-ups per day ‚Äî but the startup is confident that it can ramp up to reach its maximum capacity of 35k annual check-ups in the next five years.

Whether or not the preventative treatments promised by startups like Zoƒ´, Neko Health and Sand Clinic will ever reach the masses remains to be seen; what seems certain for now is that billionaires won‚Äôt get tired of full-body-scanning anytime soon.

Key Points

**Question** What is the cost-effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)‚Äìguided risk-stratified mammography screening intervals in the United Kingdom National Breast Cancer Screening Program?

**Findings** This decision analytical model evaluated 4 AI-based risk-stratified screening interval regimens in comparison with the current United Kingdom screening program. The net monetary benefit of introducing the optimal regimen ranged from approximately ¬£60.4 million (US $77.3 million) to ¬£85.3 million (US $109.2 million).

**Meaning** These results suggest that AI-based risk stratified breast cancer screening programs may be more cost-effective screening programs, providing additional health benefits with fewer resources than universal screening intervals for all.

**Importance** Previous research has shown good discrimination of short-term risk using an artificial intelligence (AI) risk prediction model (Mirai). However, no studies have been undertaken to evaluate whether this might translate into economic gains.

**Objective** To assess the cost-effectiveness of incorporating risk-stratified screening using a breast cancer AI model into the United Kingdom (UK) National Breast Cancer Screening Program.

**Design, Setting, and Participants** This study, conducted from January 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024, involved the development of a decision analytical model to estimate health-related quality of life, cancer survival rates, and costs over the lifetime of the female population eligible for screening. The analysis took a UK payer perspective, and the simulated cohort consisted of women aged 50 to 70 years at screening.

**Exposures** Mammography screening at 1 to 6 yearly screening intervals based on breast cancer risk and standard care (screening every 3 years).

**Main Outcomes and Measures** Incremental net monetary benefit based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and National Health Service (NHS) costs (given in pounds sterling; to convert to US dollars, multiply by 1.28).

**Results** Artificial intelligence‚Äìbased risk-stratified programs were estimated to be cost-saving and increase QALYs compared with the current screening program. A screening schedule of every 6 years for lowest-risk individuals, biannually and triennially for those below and above average risk, respectively, and annually for those at highest risk was estimated to give yearly net monetary benefits within the NHS of approximately ¬£60.4 (US $77.3) million and ¬£85.3 (US $109.2) million, with QALY values set at ¬£20‚ÄØ000 (US $25‚ÄØ600) and ¬£30‚ÄØ000 (US $38‚ÄØ400), respectively. Even in scenarios where decision-makers hesitate to allocate additional NHS resources toward screening, implementing the proposed strategies at a QALY value of ¬£1 (US $1.28) was estimated to generate a yearly monetary benefit of approximately ¬£10.6 (US $13.6) million.

**Conclusions and Relevance** In this decision analytical model study of integrating risk-stratified screening with a breast cancer AI model into the UK National Breast Cancer Screening Program, risk-stratified screening was likely to be cost-effective, yielding added health benefits at reduced costs. These results are particularly relevant for health care settings where resources are under pressure. New studies to prospectively evaluate AI-guided screening appear warranted.

Early detection of breast cancer is a top priority for the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS). The NHS largely uses an age-based screening strategy, inviting women aged 50 to 70 years for mammography screening triennially; most other countries with a breast screening program adopt a biennial program. This one-size-fits-all approach might be improved by tailoring screening so that those at highest risk receive the greatest intensity of screening (risk-based screening).

The NHS is considering the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into mammogram interpretation for breast screening in the future. AI is currently not used in NHS breast screening appointments in the UK due to a lack of high-quality prospective studies, but emerging prospective data are promising.

In parallel with AI for cancer detection, AI for risk prediction has been proposed. One such model (Mirai) interprets data automatically generated from mammogram screenings, without the need for data collection through questionnaires. The AI model offers an immediate estimation of an individual‚Äôs short-term risk of cancer incidence following a mammogram with negative findings. The AI model is open source and freely available for research and is arguably the best (retrospectively) validated AI model for short-term breast cancer risk assessment. One analysis included an external validation across 7 hospitals spanning 3 continents, and overall, evidence suggests that in the short term, it attains a higher area under the receiving operating characteristics curve than classical risk models or breast density.

While the performance of the AI model for risk assessment is highly promising, one area that has not been rigorously evaluated is whether using the model to guide screening could offer value for money. Our aim was therefore to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of integrating risk-stratified screening using the model into the UK National Breast Cancer Screening Program, through a health economic model. We considered risk-based screening strategies that would be expected to require the same number of screens as the current triennial program, assuming perfect adherence. In practice, strategies that involve extended screening intervals for a larger proportion of the population than those who receive more frequent screening might require fewer screens overall.

Specific risk-stratified breast cancer screening regimens (RSBCRs), determined by risk thresholds, were based on recent work that used a simplified deterministic model to evaluate potential effectiveness. These RSBCRs involve screening intervals aligned with corresponding risk thresholds tailored for the AI model chosen for this research. In this report, we developed an economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 4 AI-based screening strategies in comparison with the current screening program. The economic model was then used to estimate health-related quality of life, survival, and NHS costs (reported in pounds sterling; to convert to US dollars, multiply by 1.28) over the lifetime of the female population eligible for screening in the UK. Results from our analysis might inform future prospective evaluations of AI-guided screening.

This study was conducted from January 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024. We followed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) reporting guideline and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence methods of technology appraisal manual. We developed a discrete event simulation model in R, version 4.2.2, using the simmer‚Äô package (R Project for Statistical Computing) to accommodate individual attributes that evolve over time within the simulation such as breast cancer risk. The work was funded by Cancer Research UK and the policy research unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions. Because the data are drawn from publicly available sources, ethics approval is not required for decision modeling in the UK.

The following 4 strategies were distinguished by screening intervals in years for groups categorized by a 3-year risk score (RS):

1. One year (RS, ‚â•2.57%), 2 years (RS, 1.32%-2.57%), 3 years (RS, 1.22%-1.32%), or 6 years (RS, ‚â§1.22%)
2. One year (RS, ‚â•2.72%), 3 years (RS, 1.23%-2.72%), or 6 years (RS, ‚â§1.23%)
3. Two years (RS, ‚â•2.79%), 3 years (RS, 1.35%-2.79%), or 6 years (RS, ‚â§1.35%)
4. One year (RS, ‚â•2.20%), 3 years (RS, 1.23%-2.20%), or 4 years (RS, ‚â§1.23%).

The model focused on 5 dynamic processes: (1) Women transition between risk groups based on screen attendance and AI-model‚Äìassessed risk scores. (2) Mammogram accuracy is based on breast density, which changes as women age. (3) Attendance patterns to screening appointments are influenced by age and attendance history. (4) Attendance history and time intervals between screenings impact cancer stage. (5) Cancer prognosis is influenced by age, where it was identified (at regular screening or not), and attendance history, with worse outcomes for women who have not attended breast screenings.

Structure and Model Events

depicts the model structure, illustrating the sequence of clinical events and potential pathways from initiation to screening, cancer detection, and mortality. Women enter the model at the first screening invitation at 50 years of age, with subsequent invitations occurring at regular intervals until 70 years of age. Each screening appointment includes an updated AI risk assessment, determining the timing of the next screen invitation. If a woman misses her initial screening, invitations are sent every 3 years thereafter. The model ends when individuals reach cancer-related mortality or mortality from all other causes.

At entry, women are assigned predetermined ages of noncancer mortality and have a chance of developing breast cancer up to 74 years of age, sourced from Office for National Statistics life expectancy tables (2018-2020) and NHS breast cancer registry data. The age at which symptomatic cancer is detected in a primary care setting is sampled from 2020 incidence data, adjusted for age-related lead time in the UK screening program using overdiagnosis estimates. Screening may identify cancer at an earlier age than this determined age of symptomatic cancer. Data on attendance from 2018 to 2019, stratified by age and screening history, were used to calculate attendance probability to a screening invitation. The NHS incurs a cost of ¬£14.52 (US $18.59) for each screening invitation (details of screening costs are in eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Screening invitations end at 70 years of age or the nearest subsequent year if screening is not scheduled at 70 years of age. For instance, in simulating the current program with screenings every 3 years, a woman attending screening at 68 years of age would receive her last invitation at 71 years of age, after which any developing cancers would be detected symptomatically.

Model Event: Screening Appointment

Attending women undergo a mammogram; if cancer is detected, further assessments are conducted. Breast density and AI model scores are from UK women aged 46 to 74 years and applied based on age and cancer presence. Details are available in eMethods 1 in Supplement 1.

In the model, a woman‚Äôs age for potential tumor detection is set before her first screening and remains constant throughout her life. Screening detection ages are calculated by subtracting the tumor presence period from the age at which symptomatic cancer is detected. The tumor presence period is derived from national breast screening program data and is based on age, with mean durations ranging from approximately 6 years at 35 years of age to 8 years at 85 years of age.

Each mammography session has a cost of ¬£54.32 (US $69.53) and results in a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss of 0.0014 due to associated discomfort. A summary table of the diagnostic accuracy of mammography is presented in eTable 1 in Supplement 1. Sensitivity estimates are sourced from recent estimates in a population-based screening program and vary based on breast density, ranging from 62% (dense) to 90% (not dense). False-positive results occur when no underlying tumor is present during a screening, with chances ranging from 1.5% (not dense) to 2.9% (dense), and they cause a QALY loss of 0.0771. Mammographic results indicating cancer leads to further assessments, which verify whether the cancer is present, and involve mammography, ultrasonography, and biopsy totaling ¬£484.90 (US $620.67). Detailed breakdowns of mammography‚Äôs diagnostic accuracy, screening and further assessment costs, and screen-related QALY losses are found in eTables 2 and 3 in Supplement 1.

Model Event: Interval Between Screening Appointments

Between screening appointments, cancers are detected immediately in primary care on reaching the age of symptomatic detection, with the primary care appointment costing ¬£37.00 (US $47.36), and further assessment totaling ¬£484.90 (US $620.67) NHS cost. Mortality due to other causes than breast cancer can occur and aging results in a health utility loss based on a published formula.

Model Event: Cancer Treatment and Survival

After cancer detection, cancer is classified as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive tumor TNM stages I to IV, determined by age and mode of detection (at a screening appointment or symptomatically in primary care) using UK population screening data. The stage distribution is adjusted based on the time since the last screen, using US data comparing stage distribution by screening frequency. Detailed methodology and sources can be found in Hill et al.

Treatment-related health losses and NHS costs vary by age, stage, mode of detection (screen or symptomatic), and time since detection (for follow-up costs and health recovery). Health utility losses after cancer are taken from multivariate regression, using the utility decrements on age, stage, and mode of detection. Recovery times are 11 years for screen-detected and interval cancers and 12 years for symptomatic cancers, based on peak health-related quality of life values post cancer detection. Stage 4 cancers are assumed to show no improvement in quality of life.

Cancer survival estimates come from Office for National Statistics mortality statistics and multivariable regressions. Mortality hazard ratios by stage and detection mode are applied to age-based mortality to determine life expectancy. Cancer treatment-related utility losses, costs, and survival estimates are available in eTables 4 to 6 in Supplement 1.

Economic and Clinical Outcomes

Costs were assessed from a UK payer perspective and reported in 2022 pounds sterling. Quality-adjusted life-years and costs were discounted at 3.5%. The main economic outcome is incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) per woman, which quantifies in monetary terms the net benefit of interventions by reflecting the potential alternative use of intervention resources for other health care treatments. Incremental net monetary benefit is established from differences in patient costs, and from assigning a monetary value to the difference in QALYs, which we assume to be ¬£20 000 (US $25 600), ¬£30 000 (US $38 400), and ¬£1 (US $1.28) per QALY. The latter represents a scenario where a decision-maker is reluctant to spend additional NHS resources to increase population health. Population-wide INMB is derived by multiplying the per-woman INMB by the population size of women at 50 years of age eligible for screening invitations, which is 174‚ÄØ523, sourced from the 2022 national breast screening program data. Clinical outcomes include tumor stage at detection, cancers detected during screening, breast cancer deaths prevented by RSBCRs in the population (174‚ÄØ523 women), and the number of screens conducted.

All analyses were performed using R, version 4.2.2 (R Program for Statistical Computing). We conducted external validation of the model against targets derived from the 2022 national breast screening program data. To identify where savings occur, cost results are divided into screening-related costs and those for treating DCIS and invasive cancers. Cancer treatment costs are broken down by stage (DCIS, stages I-II, and stages III-IV) and mode of detection (screen-detected and interval cancers). Deterministic sensitivity analysis is conducted by adjusting the cancer treatment and screening costs, health-related quality of life losses from cancer and screening, and mammography sensitivity. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is performed using 250 Monte Carlo simulations using probabilistic sensitivity analysis parameter distributions reported in eTable 8 in Supplement 1. The probability that each RSBCR is cost-effective is illustrated on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Population-wide INMB estimates from the 250 Monte Carlo simulations are calculated across cost per QALY values ranging from ¬£1 (US $1.28) to ¬£100 000 (US $128 000).

shows base-case economic results and the annual impact of the economic results in the entire population. All the AI-based regimens were associated with reduced NHS costs and increased QALYs compared with the current screening program. The strategy of conducting screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk had the highest additional net monetary gain per woman invited for screening. This amounts to ¬£346 (US $442.88) and ¬£489 (US $625.92) under the assumption of QALY values being ¬£20‚ÄØ000 (US $25 600) and ¬£30 000 (US $38 400), respectively. Consequently, this leads to an annual net monetary benefit within the NHS screening program totaling ¬£10.6 million (US $13.6 million) for QALY values of ¬£1, ¬£60.4 million (US $77.3 million) for QALY values of ¬£20 000, and ¬£85.3 million (US $109.2 million) for QALY values of ¬£30 000. The 3 alternative approaches had comparable figures for the net monetary benefit gained. For instance, the screening strategy of 6 yearly, triannual, and biannual screening has the smallest incremental net monetary benefit, amounting to ¬£188 (US $240.64) and ¬£236 (US $302.08) per person, assuming QALY values of ¬£20‚ÄØ000 and ¬£30 000, respectively. This resulted in an annual population incremental net benefit of ¬£32.7 million (US $41.9 million), assuming ¬£20‚ÄØ000 per QALY and ¬£41.2 million (US $52.7 million), assuming ¬£30‚ÄØ000 per QALY.

shows the clinical and screening program results. The clinical outcomes of all regimens showed an improvement compared with the current screening program. Compared with the current screening program, conducting screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk resulted in a higher number of screen-detected cancers (10‚ÄØ549 vs 8943), a greater percentage of DCIS cancers at detection (17.1% vs 13.6%), a reduction in the number of screens (mean [SD], 3.22 [0.02] vs 4.68 [0.05]), and prevention of 834 deaths due to breast cancer.

Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis Results

The deterministic sensitivity analysis results align with the cost-effectiveness of screening regimens found in the base-case model. Screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk was likely to be most beneficial. Risk-stratified breast cancer screening regimens maintained their cost-effectiveness compared with the current program and each other. The breakdown of NHS costs incurred by women show screening costs are lower in the RSBCR than in the current program. Cancer treatment costs incurred are larger for RSBCRs due to life extension for patients with cancer from increased screen detection of cancers and early cancer detection (see Table 2).

Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis Results

The probabilistic sensitivity analysis results demonstrate an improvement in the cost-effectiveness of screening regimens compared with the base-case model, without a shift in the ranking of programs from most to least cost-effective. The regimen with screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, or 6 years had the highest probability of being cost-effective (59% at ¬£20‚ÄØ000 [US $25 600] per QALY) and had the largest net monetary benefit for all cost per QALY thresholds. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve shows the regimen of 2, 3, or 6 years was likely to be the least cost-effective alternative option for RSBCRs, and the current screening program has a negligible probability of being cost-effective across all cost per QALY thresholds.

Under our analytic model, AI-based risk-stratified screening is likely to be cost-effective compared with the current one-size-fits-all screening program. Our findings are consistent with previous modeling studies demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of risk-stratified screening, whether based on traditional risk factors like family history or newer methods such as polygenic risk scores. However, our model is the first to suggest that health care resources might be reduced with RSBCRs, while attaining at least the same effectiveness for the population. This study is also the first to assess the cost-effectiveness of AI interpretation of breast images for risk assessment during routine screening. This might be more feasible at scale than the other risk assessment methods.

While the estimated incremental economic benefits per individual invited to breast screening may seem modest in the base-case model, ranging from ¬£188 (US $240.64) to ¬£346 (US $442.88), the annual monetary gains for the NHS might be substantial, estimated to range from ¬£32.7 million (US $ 41.9 million) to ¬£60.4 million (US $77.3 million). In the probabilistic model, these savings are around 3 times larger. The health economic model suggests that RSBCRs can reduce screening utilization, NHS costs, and invasive cancer in the population and increase QALYs. The reduction in the number of screenings with an RSBCR could free up resources to address screening backlogs and reduce wait times where those problems exist in the UK, potentially further improving breast cancer outcomes.

Annual screening RSBCRs lead to higher percentages of screen-detected cancers and greater percentages of DCIS cancers at detection, along with higher QALYs. However, biennial screening for the highest-risk group, with corresponding 3 and 6 yearly screening for other risk groups, incurs lower costs due to fewer screenings. Screen utilization is not the only explanation of the difference in cost-effectiveness among the regimens. Other contributing factors are the proportion of individuals at medium and high risk within the population undergoing intensified screening surveillance, their uptake to screening appointments, and the accuracy of mammography in women with denser breast tissue that makes cancers harder to detect. Although cost-effectiveness is important, it is not the only factor to consider when comparing the benefits of the regimen. For example, a population accustomed to the UK‚Äôs triennial screening program may view a 6-year gap between screenings as unacceptable, favoring a 4-year interval instead. This change to an RSBCR screening program with a 4-year screening interval for patients at low risk would generate an annual monetary benefit of ¬£50 million (US $64 million), assuming a QALY is valued at ¬£20 000 (US $25 600). Significant variations in screening frequency within programs can be accepted by patients. In the UK, colonoscopy surveillance guidelines for cancer vary by risk level, with no surveillance for patients at low risk, every 3 years for patients at intermediate risk, and annually for patients at high risk.

This study has some limitations. First, the model is parametrized for the UK. Findings may not be directly generalizable to alternative geographical populations, such as the US or elsewhere in Europe. Clinical guidelines in these regions often recommend universal annual or biennial screening, while a triennial screening program is in place in the UK, and typically screening also begins at earlier ages in these regions. Therefore, the comparator screen detection rates based on triennial screening, on which the model depends, are likely to differ across populations with varied screening frequencies and onset ages. For example, in a setting where annual screening is the norm, all the regimens considered would reduce costs but also effectiveness. Further analysis using the model could usefully contribute to decisions on the economic value of decreasing intensity of screening based on breast cancer AI in such settings.

In this decision analytical model study of risk-based screening with AI-based risk assessment, risk-based screening delivered health benefits while using fewer NHS resources compared with the current UK breast screening program. New studies to prospectively evaluate AI-guided screening appear warranted.

- A recent retrospective cohort study in the UK revealed significant demographic disparities in access to cardiac surgery, particularly highlighting that women, Black individuals, and those from deprived areas are notably less likely to receive timely surgical interventions.
- üìâ The study, analyzing data from over 292,000 heart disease patients (2010-2019), found that:
   - Women were 59% less likely to undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) compared to men.
   - Black patients faced a 32% lower likelihood of receiving CABG than White patients.
   - Individuals living in the lowest socioeconomic quintile were 35% less likely to access CABG and experienced a startling 24% higher risk of mortality within a year.

TOPLINE:
--------

In the United Kingdom, women, Black people, and those living in deprived areas are less likely to be offered heart surgery and have higher postoperative mortality rates.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   Retrospective cohort study of the UK National Health Service and national mortality data.
*   Among adults admitted to the hospital with heart disease from 2010 to 2019, authors examined demographics of 292,140 who had coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or valve surgery.
*   Outcomes of interest were access to surgery, in-hospital mortality, 1-year mortality, and hospital readmission.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Worse outcomes occurred in women vs men, Black vs White people, and people living in the lowest vs highest socioeconomic quintile.
*   These groups were 59%, 32%, and 35% less likely to get CABG and 31%, 33%, and 39% less likely to get valve surgery, respectively, than comparator groups.
*   They were 24%, 85%, and 18%, respectively, more likely to die within a year after CABG.
*   After valve surgery, women were 19% more likely to die, and people from the most deprived areas were 10% more likely to die within a year.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

MADRID ‚Äî In a rat study, two versions of an experimental monthly injectable semaglutide-loaded hydrogel show extended release over 1 month and good tolerance. If found to be safe and effective in people, a once-monthly formulation could improve patient adherence and quality of life of those with type 2 diabetes or obesity.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   About half or more patients taking semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist approved for treating obesity with or without type 2 diabetes, may discontinue treatment with their once-weekly subcutaneous injections or daily oral pills at 12 months, but longer-acting formulations may increase drug efficacy and patient adherence.
*   Researchers have developed two versions of an injectable semaglutide-loaded hydrogel mixed with a pair of degradable polymers that chemically bond together.
*   After injection, the formulations form either a gel disk or microgel suspension that enables a gradual and prolonged drug release.
*   To identify the optimal formulation, researchers analyzed the hydrogel compositions in vitro to study drug release kinetics, duration of effectiveness, and semaglutide loading content.
*   The experimental semaglutide-loaded hydrogel disk or microgel particles were injected subcutaneously in six wild-type Wistar Han male rats of normal weight (250-300 g) to characterize semaglutide pharmacokinetics and hydrogel biocompatibility.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   The formulation could be easily injected using a 25G needle, with gelation starting within minutes of mixing.
*   In both versions, a single injection of the hydrogel-based formulations in rats demonstrated a minimal initial early release, followed by a consistent release over the course of 1 month.
*   The product was well tolerated with no edema or inflammatory reaction during the treatment period.
*   The hydrogel could be easily degraded by enzymes in in vitro studies.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""A small dollop of gel, known as a 'depot,' of the semaglutide-laden hydrogel is injected under the skin,"" said Claire M√©gret, PhD, lead author of the poster presentation, in a news release. ""Our pre-clinical results demonstrate that the regular, slow release of semaglutide over one month after administering a single dose, with limited early release, is achievable,"" she added.

Primary Care Women's Health Forum | 09 September 2024

**In Anticipation of Guidelines Live 2024, the PCWHF Provides a Taster of its Sessions in the Women‚Äôs Health Stream, Which Will Address Key Issues Around Menopause and HRT**

The Primary Care Women‚Äôs Health Forum (PCWHF) is excited to return to Guidelines Live in 2024, following its success delivering presentations to full lecture theatres in 2023. This year, PCWHF speaker sessions will have a primary-care relevant, practical focus, underpinned by realistic case studies to illustrate the application of guidelines in the real world.

Published in 2022, the Women‚Äôs Health Strategy for England notes that there is not enough focus on women-specific issues such as menopause. Over the past few years, healthcare professionals have faced challenges such as shortages of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT), a lack of licensed options for testosterone as part of HRT, and funding for the fitting of intrauterine devices and implants that may not cover the costs of the procedure.

In the first of the PCWHF speaker sessions on Day 1, **Dr Julie Oliver**, PCWHF Chair, will discuss the recent British Menopause Society guideline on the management of unscheduled bleeding in women taking HRT. The guideline provides a new approach to risk stratification, and includes a helpful one-page summary flowchart to guide management. It also answers the perennial question ‚ÄòHow high is too high?‚Äô‚Äîthat is, what is the oestrogen dose needed to increase the amount of progestogen in an HRT regime? Dr Oliver is an NHS GP in County Durham, with an extended role in women‚Äôs health and a long history of speaking at conferences such as Guidelines Live.

On the Day 2 of Guidelines Live 2024, **Dr Caroline Cooper** will give a contraception update, with a focus on new guidance. Dr Cooper will explore contraceptive options for women over 40 years of age, emphasising safety, efficacy, and individualised care approaches. Dr Cooper is an experienced GP with an extended role in women‚Äôs health. She is also a faculty-registered trainer, and has served on the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare committees, as well as being a current director of the PCWHF.

Next, **Dr Angela Wright** will continue the HRT theme, but adding relevance to younger women, by discussing testosterone and libido. Informed by her experience of primary and secondary care NHS work, Dr Wright‚Äôs speaker session will explain how those in primary care can support women who have complex menopause issues, sexual dysfunction, and premenstrual disorders. Dr Wright is a fellow of the European Committee of Sexual Medicine, and an active committee member of the British Society of Sexual Medicine.

### The Primary Care Women‚Äôs Health Forum

These Guidelines Live sessions are supported by the Primary Care Women‚Äôs Health Forum (PCWHF), a group of 10,000 healthcare professionals with a special interest in women‚Äôs health. The PCWHF aims to promote and progress standards in women‚Äôs health in primary care through education, resources, and events, and lobbies on behalf of its members to determine future strategic direction and policymaking for women‚Äôs health.

TOPLINE:
--------

Middle-aged adults who consume more ultra-processed foods have an elevated risk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that is mediated in part through circulating biomarkers.

METHODOLOGY: 
-------------

Investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study of 207,012 middle-aged adults without RA from the UK Biobank who completed 24-hour dietary recalls. Foods and beverages were classified as (1) unprocessed or minimally processed foods, (2) processed culinary ingredients, (3) processed foods, or (4) ultra-processed foods (eg, soft drinks, sweet or savoury packaged snacks, reconstituted meat products, pre-prepared frozen dishes). The main outcome was the incident RA based on hospital diagnoses.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

Overall, 0.9% of participants received an RA diagnosis during a median follow-up of about 12 years. Relative to peers in the lowest quintile of ultra-processed food consumption, participants in the highest quintile had a 17% greater adjusted risk for RA. The risk rose across quintile (P < .05) and increased by 6% with each standard deviation increase in ultra-processed food intake. Mediation analyses suggested that inflammatory, lipid, and liver enzyme biomarkers explained 3.1%-14.8% of the association between ultra-processed food intake and RA risk. Findings were similar regardless of participants' age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, household income, and healthy diet score.

IN PRACTICE: 
-------------

""Lower [ultra-processed food] consumption is recommended to reduce RA incidence,"" the authors wrote, noting that up to half of the food consumed in the United Kingdom now falls into the ultra-processed category. ""Dietary guidelines should prominently feature the detrimental effects of [ultra-processed foods], and recommendations to curtail their consumption should be integrated into public health initiatives, to mitigate the risk of RA,"" they added.

- A recent study analyzed outcomes for 1,282 women in Queensland, Australia, who underwent bariatric surgery prior to pregnancy.üåè The findings reveal that women who had this surgery are likely to give birth to smaller babies compared to those who did not. 
- Key statistics indicate a concerning trend: bariatric surgery correlates with a higher risk of having smaller than average infants (Odds Ratio [OR], 1.78) and a lower risk for larger babies (OR, 0.54). üìâ  
- Additionally, the rate of preterm births in women who had surgery was significantly higher (10.5% vs. 7.8%; _P_ = .007).  Babies of these women also weighed less on average at birth (3223 g vs. 3418 g; _P_ < .001). 
- On a positive note, those who underwent the procedure experienced lower rates of gestational diabetes (15.1% vs. 19.9%; _P_ < .001) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (3.7% vs. 5.4%; _P_ = .01). 

While bariatric surgery seems to reduce some maternal risks, the trade-off appears to be an increased risk to the neonate. How should we balance these factors when advising patients considering pregnancy post-surgery? ü©∫

**TOPLINE:**
------------

Women who underwent bariatric surgery prior to pregnancy are more likely to have smaller babies than those who did not undergo the surgery.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   In a cross-sectional matched study, researchers analyzed pregnancy and newborn outcomes among 1282 women in Queensland, Australia, who underwent bariatric surgery prior to pregnancy and gave birth between 2013 and 2018.
*   The outcomes were pregnancy complications, birth weight of newborn, length of pregnancy, whether the baby was smaller or larger than average, and preterm births.
*   Women who had surgery were matched 1:10 on age, smoking status, and body mass index to those who did not have the surgery.
*   Overall, 93% women had a laparoscopic gastric sleeve surgery, 4.3% had a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery, and the remaining 2.7% had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   Bariatric surgery was associated with a higher risk of having smaller than average babies (odds ratio \[OR\], 1.78; 95% CI, 1.46-2.17; _P_ < .001) and a lower risk of having larger than average babies (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44-0.66; _P_ < .001).
*   The rate of preterm births was higher in women who underwent bariatric surgery before pregnancy than in matched women (10.5% vs 7.8%; _P_ = .007).
*   Babies born to women who underwent bariatric surgery had lower average birth weights (3223 g ¬± 605 g vs 3418 g ¬± 595 g; _P_ < .001).
*   Women who underwent bariatric surgery showed lower rates of gestational diabetes (15.1% vs 19.9%; _P_ < .001) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (3.7% vs 5.4%; _P_ = .01).

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""Overall prepregnancy bariatric surgery, including restrictive procedures, appears to reduce some maternal pregnancy risks but increases the neonatal risk of lower birth weight, early preterm delivery, and their potential associated long-term sequalae,"" the authors wrote.

**SOURCE:**

This study was led by Jade Eccles-Smith, of the Department of Obstetric Medicine, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in Brisbane, Australia. It was [published online](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378/(24/)00899-8/abstract) on September 01, 2024, in the _American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology_.

**LIMITATIONS:**  
-----------------

The study's limitations included the potential bias from manual data entry and missing information. Additionally, the lack of data on maternal diet and weight gain limited the ability to assess how these factors might have affected the growth of the baby.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The researchers did not report any specific funding. The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

TOPLINE:
--------

Reduced antibiotic prescribing for pneumonia in primary care, including practices with the lowest prescribing rates, appears to be safe and does not lead to untowards adverse events or increased hospitalisations.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   Retrospective analysis examining the association between antibiotic prescribing rates for respiratory tract infection (RTI) in 1471 general practices (GP) in England and adverse outcomes ‚â§ 30 days (hospitalisation for pneumonia, primary care re-consultation for respiratory/lung conditions, additional antibiotic prescriptions, and new prescription at re-consultation).
*   Data were derived from the Clinical Practice Research Datalinlk (2005-2019) of all ages with GP consultation.
*   GP practice prescriptions were divided by quintile: highest, second highest, third highest, fourth highest, and lower.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Sample comprised 9,913,568 patients across 1471 GP practices with 35,921 RTI-related consultations. There were 29,498,958 prescriptions written, and 1,535,740 hospitalisations. 
*   RTI-related prescriptions, 1-6 days post-RTI consultations fell steadily from 13.9% (higher prescribing practices) to 5.2% (lower).
*   Annual GP RTI-related consultations and prescriptions increased from 2005, peaked in 2012 and then declined; higher numbers were recorded for women, and prescriptions increased with number of comorbidities and with age.
*   No significant changes were seen in hospitalisation for pneumonia ‚â§ 6 days of an RTI-related consultation over quintiles and included the lowest (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1.02).
*   RTI-related consultations ‚â§ 30 days were significantly higher for lowest prescribing practices (aOR, 1.209; 95% CI, 1.206-1.212) but additional and subsequent prescriptions were significantly lower (aOR, 0.317 [95% CI, 0.314-0.321] and 0.706 [95% CI, 0.699-0.712], respectively).

IN PRACTICE:
------------

""For the vast majority of primary care practices, further reductions in RTI-related antibiotic prescribing, up to an order of two- to three-fold reductions, should be possible without an increase in adverse clinical outcomes,"" the authors wrote.

SOURCE:
-------

The study was led by James Stimson, UK Security Agency, UK, and appeared online in the Journal of Infection.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Limitations included inconsistent diagnostic coding, a lack of information on prescription fills or delayed starts.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

The study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. The authors expressed no financial disclosures of interest.

However, recent updates from the Endocrine Society offer new guidance for assessing and supplementing vitamin D in healthy individuals.

- The **Endocrine Society** now recommends **against routine testing** of vitamin D levels in asymptomatic individuals, including children and those over 75 years of age. This could significantly reduce unnecessary testing burdens.

- üí° Surprisingly, the **recommended daily intake** for vitamin D by the Endocrine Society has increased to **600 IU** (15 mcg) for ages 1-70, and **800 IU** (20 mcg) for those 71 and older, much higher than the UK‚Äôs current recommendation of **400 IU**. 

- Key populations advised for **empiric supplementation** include:
  - **Children and adolescents** (1-18 years) to help prevent rickets and reduce respiratory infections.
  - Individuals aged **75 and older** to lower mortality risk.  
  - **Pregnant women**, to minimize risks related to pre-eclampsia and neonatal mortality, with recommended doses ranging from **600-5000 IU**. 
  - Adults with **high-risk prediabetes** to prevent progression to diabetes.

As we consider these updates, it begs the question: How can we optimize vitamin D supplementation while navigating existing healthcare practices and patient beliefs? ü§î

Read This Article to Learn More About:

*   the Endocrine Society‚Äôs recommendations on who should and should not undergo testing for vitamin D status, and which asymptomatic groups should receive empiric supplementation
*   recommended daily reference intakes for vitamin D in the updated guideline, which differ from those of other guidance 
*   potential barriers to implementation of the Endocrine Society guideline in the UK.

Vitamin D is made in the skin by the action of ultraviolet B (UVB) light (accounting for 80‚Äì90% of total body vitamin D), or ingested in natural or fortified foods or supplements (accounting for 10‚Äì20% of total body vitamin D). It is metabolised to 25(OH) vitamin D in the liver, then a second hydroxylation occurs, primarily in the kidneys, to produce the active form 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D. Through its interaction with the vitamin D receptor, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D helps to control calcium and phosphate levels in the body, thus impacting musculoskeletal health. Vitamin D is also associated with nonmusculoskeletal conditions, including respiratory infections, cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic diseases, autoimmune conditions, cancers, and neurological illnesses. Drugs, genetic polymorphisms, terminal ileal disease, malabsorption, and kidney disease can all influence the metabolism and circulating level of vitamin D.

The identification of links between vitamin D status and certain conditions has resulted in increased testing for 25(OH) vitamin D, the recommended biomarker, as well as widespread supplementation, both prescribed and purchased in pharmacies and health stores across the UK. Supplementation further increased in the COVID-19 pandemic, during which free 400-IU vitamin D supplements were provided to vulnerable people practising shielding. However, there is growing concern that individuals for whom vitamin D supplementation (albeit at a low dose) is currently recommended are not receiving or choosing not to take the appropriate supplementation.

### The Updated Endocrine Society Guideline on Vitamin D

Against this backdrop, Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline was presented at the Endocrine Society meeting in June 2024, and simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. The updated guideline offers pragmatic advice on blood testing for 25(OH) vitamin D and vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of disease in healthy people in particular, and may cause some controversy by altering current practice in the UK. It is supported by an open-access systematic review, published in the same issue of the journal, that focuses on 14 clinically relevant questions relating to vitamin D testing and supplementation.

Other guidelines on vitamin D in specific groups are available in the UK, including the Royal Osteoporosis Society (ROS)‚Äôs Vitamin D and bone health: a practical clinical guideline for patient management‚Äîwhich covers the management of osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and people at risk of these conditions‚Äîand other guidelines focusing on chronic diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; see the Useful Resources box at the end of the article). These groups are not covered by the Endocrine Society guideline, which seeks to provide vitamin D guidance for asymptomatic populations.

This article examines the updated Endocrine Society guideline, highlighting the key practice-changing recommendations for primary care.

**Overview of the Updated Guideline**

### Daily Reference Intakes and Definitions of Key Terms

In 2011, the US National Academy of Medicine (NAM; formerly the Institute of Medicine) established daily reference intakes (DRIs) for vitamin D of 600 IU (15 mcg) for those aged 1‚Äì70 years and 800 IU (20 mcg) for those aged 71 years and older, and these are retained as the baseline intakes for all groups for which supplementation is not recommended in the Endocrine Society guideline. Notably, these daily intake recommendations are higher than the 10-mcg reference nutrient intake (RNI; equating to 400 IU), advocated in the UK since 2016 for everyone in the general population aged 4 years or older by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN).

The term ‚Äòempiric supplementation‚Äô is used throughout the updated guideline to mean supplementation that exceeds the DRI for a given age group and is derived from natural and fortified foods and oral supplements without testing of 25(OH) vitamin D levels. When supplementation is recommended within the guideline, the range of doses used in clinical trials is documented, together with the approximate weighted average daily dose equivalent, as demonstrated in the preceding paragraph.

### Overarching Themes

Three central topics are covered in the guideline: assessment of vitamin D status, mode of vitamin D supplementation, and skin pigmentation and vitamin D. These are discussed in more detail in Box 1.

Box 1: Three Overarching Topics in the Updated Endocrine Society Guideline

**Assessment of Vitamin D Status**

Previously, guidance on vitamin D focused mainly on those with vitamin D deficiency, who it was assumed would most benefit from supplementation. However, the optimal 25(OH) vitamin D blood level for asymptomatic, healthy people has yet to be determined, and varies between guidelines.

The Endocrine Society guideline development group sought to use subgroup analyses of RCT evidence to identify vitamin D thresholds for patient-important outcomes, but found that there is no clear lower threshold below which supplementation has been demonstrated to be beneficial and that, for some populations, those with a high blood level of vitamin D may still benefit from supplementation. Based on the RCT evidence in the associated systematic review, baseline testing or monitoring of 25(OH) vitamin D status in the asymptomatic people covered by the guideline is therefore not recommended. As a result, the Endocrine Society no longer recognises the thresholds for 25(OH) vitamin D levels given in its 2011 guideline‚Äîvitamin D sufficiency (at least 75 nmol/l) and insufficiency (more than 50 nmol/l but less than 75 nmol/l) based on serum testing.

**Mode of Vitamin D Supplementation**

Throughout the guideline, daily vitamin D dosing as oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or D2 (ergocalciferol) is recommended over higher-dose, intermittent supplementation for healthy people in whom supplementation is recommended. This is particularly relevant in older people, in whom higher intermittent vitamin D doses may be ineffective or increase the risk of falls or fractures.

Use of active vitamin D metabolites, such as calcitriol, is not recommended in the Endocrine Society guideline‚Äîthese can cause hypercalcaemia, and need careful monitoring. They are, however, recommended in some other guidelines for individuals with compromised vitamin D metabolism, such as those with CKD.

**Skin Pigmentation and Vitamin D**

The updated guideline does not make specific recommendations on skin pigmentation and vitamin D, firstly because of a lack of clinical studies looking specifically at pigmentation, and secondly because of controversy about the relative impact of studying skin pigmentation versus race and ethnicity. These topics are addressed in an accompanying open-access commentary.

RCT=randomised controlled trial; CKD=chronic kidney disease

**Prioritised Clinical Questions**

### Recommendations Against Routine Testing

In the updated guideline, the 14 prioritised clinical questions relating to vitamin D testing and supplementation in healthy, asymptomatic individuals are discussed individually. Crucially, recommendations 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, and 14 recommend against routine testing for 25(OH) vitamin D in children and adults of all ages in the general population, including in those aged 75 years and older, during pregnancy, and in those with pigmented skin or obesity.

#### _Pregnancy_

In pregnancy, there is no evidence that only those with a low blood level of 25(OH) vitamin D stand to benefit from vitamin D supplementation; therefore, the Endocrine Society recommended against testing. However, despite the fact that the necessity of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is evidence-based, supplementation to the baseline levels recommended in this guideline is not widely adopted in the UK at present.

#### _Obesity_

People with obesity can have lower levels of circulating 25(OH) vitamin D, but this may reflect increased sequestration of the 25(OH) vitamin D in fat, its dilution in a larger fat mass, or decreased vitamin D hydroxylation in people with obesity. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation (daily vitamin D doses: 400 IU with calcium or 2000 IU without calcium) in people with obesity (body mass index over 30 kg/m2) showed no reduction in fracture risk; likewise, a range of RCTs found no decrease in the incidence of CV events, cancers, or respiratory infections in people with obesity receiving vitamin D supplementation. Therefore, based on current RCT evidence, a decision was taken not to routinely test or offer empiric supplementation in people with obesity, although further evidence will be explored in future updates.

#### _Pigmented Skin_

Increased melanin content in the skin reduces 25(OH) vitamin D production in response to sunlight exposure; it could be assumed, therefore, that people with deeply pigmented skin are at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency or are more likely to benefit from supplementation. However, the Endocrine Society examined the RCT evidence and found no trials comparing different skin colours, although many studies use self-declared race or ethnicity as unvalidated proxies for skin pigmentation. Moreover, there are no standardised methods for measuring skin pigmentation, and some factors associated with self-declared race, such as social determinants of health, may have more impact on 25(OH) vitamin D levels than skin colour. Therefore, the panel made a conditional recommendation supported by very low-quality evidence not to recommend 25(OH) vitamin D screening in this group. However, the panel did call for further research.

### Recommendations on Supplementation

The evidence-based recommendations on supplementation are discussed in Box 2.

Box 2: Recommendations on Supplementation in the Endocrine Society Guideline

**Recommendation 1: Children and Adolescents**

In children and adolescents aged 1‚Äì18 years, vitamin D supplementation is recommended to both prevent nutritional rickets and reduce the risk of respiratory tract infections. Daily doses of 300‚Äì2000 IU (7.5‚Äì50 mcg) were used to reduce respiratory infections in the RCTs examined by the systematic review, with a weighted mean of 1200 IU (30 mcg). Notably, in the US, supplementation with 400 IU (10 mcg) vitamin D is recommended for children younger than 1 year who are not exclusively formula-fed.

**Recommendations 2 and 4: The General Adult Population**

In the general population of adults aged under 50 years and 50‚Äì74 years, empiric vitamin D supplementation is not recommended. 'Empiric' refers to supplementation that exceeds baseline DRIs; generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing should follow the DRIs established by the NAM (600 IU [15 mcg] daily for those aged 18‚Äì70 years; 800 IU [20 mcg] daily for those older than 70 years).

**Recommendation 6: Adults Aged Over 75 Years**

In the general population of adults aged 75 years or older, empiric vitamin D supplementation is recommended to reduce mortality risk, based on high-certainty evidence showing small mortality reductions. Daily, lower-dose supplementation is recommended over irregular, higher doses. The daily doses used in the trials demonstrating reduced mortality ranged from 400‚Äì3333 IU (10‚Äì83 mcg), with a weighted average of 900 IU (23 mcg); however, many trial participants were also allowed to continue their own additional vitamin D supplements of up to 800 IU (20 mcg) during the studies.

**Recommendation 8: Pregnancy**

Empiric vitamin D supplementation is recommended during pregnancy to lower the risks of pre-eclampsia, intrauterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality, based on low-certainty evidence. The vitamin D doses used in the studies ranged from 600‚Äì5000 IU (15‚Äì125 mcg), and were provided daily or weekly. The estimated weighted average was approximately 2500 IU (63 mcg) daily. These doses are significantly higher than the 400-IU baseline vitamin D intake from foods and supplements currently recommended during pregnancy in the UK.

**Recommendation 10: High-risk Prediabetes**

In addition to lifestyle modification, empiric vitamin D supplementation is recommended in adults with high-risk prediabetes to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes, based on moderate-certainty evidence. High-risk prediabetes is defined as meeting two or three ADA glycaemia criteria for prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose [fasting glucose of 5.6‚Äì6.9 mmol/l], HbA1c 39‚Äì47 mmol/mol, or impaired glucose tolerance [2-h plasma glucose after 75-g OGTT of 7.8 mmol/l to less than 11.1 mmol/l]). The daily doses used in the studies ranged from 842‚Äì7543 IU (21‚Äì189 mcg), with an estimated weighted average of 3500 IU (88 mcg).

Because only HbA1c is currently used to identify prediabetes in the UK and a range of 42‚Äì47 mmol/mol is used, rather than the 39‚Äì47 mmol/mol range used in the US, it may prove difficult to identify those meeting this definition without additional testing of fasting blood glucose, as the OGTT is now not generally used in the UK, except for diagnosing gestational diabetes. Those with an HbA1c towards the top of the prediabetes range, or in whom HbA1c is increasing despite lifestyle interventions, can be considered high risk and may benefit from supplementation; however, UK guidance does not make specific recommendations about vitamin D supplementation in this group.

**Recommendation 11: Mode of Empiric Vitamin D Supplementation**

For adults aged 50 years and older in whom empiric vitamin D is recommended, daily, lower-dose vitamin D supplementation is recommended instead of intermittent, higher doses, because these have been shown in some studies to increase risk of falls or fractures.

RCT=randomised controlled trial; DRI=daily reference intake; NAM=National Academy of Medicine; ADA=American Diabetes Association; HbA1c=glycated haemoglobin; OGTT=oral glucose tolerance test

### Limitations of Evidence

Everyone in the clinical studies likely had some sun exposure and ingested some vitamin D from natural or fortified foods, and many studies allowed continuation of self-purchased baseline supplementation, making it difficult to evaluate the exact vitamin D intake in the individual studies informing the guideline. The authors were hampered by lack of RCT evidence of sufficient duration to provide data on conditions such as cancer, CV disease, or osteoporosis. Studies in those aged over 50 years often used a combination of calcium and vitamin D, making the effects of vitamin D alone unclear. Few studies included people with low baseline 25(OH) vitamin D levels.

**Comparisons With Other Guidance**

Several other guidelines cover vitamin D supplementation in healthy people, the recommendations of which differ from those of the Endocrine Society guideline on some points.

### Recommended Daily Intakes

Published in 2012, DHSC guidance suggests that people aged 65 years and older, with low or no sun exposure (housebound or covering skin for cultural reasons), or with darker skin may be at risk of vitamin D deficiency, and should take a daily 400-IU vitamin D supplement. Similarly, the 2018 SACN guidance, last reviewed in December 2023, recommends a ‚Äòsafe intake‚Äô of 8.5‚Äì10 mcg of vitamin D for infants from birth to 1 year and 10 mcg/400 IU daily for those aged 1‚Äì4 years, and sets a year-round RNI of 10 mcg for all those aged over 4 years in the UK, including pregnant and lactating women and those at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency. Both the DHSC and SACN guidelines therefore advocate a significantly lower intake than that of the NAM, used by the Endocrine Society guideline, which recommends a daily vitamin D dose of 600 IU for people aged 1‚Äì70 years, and 800 IU per day for those aged 71 years and over.

### Doses in Infants, Children, and Young People

The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) guidance on vitamin D in infants, children, and young people recommends that all infants ‚Äòshould receive a daily vitamin D supplement of 8.5‚Äì10 mcg from birth until one year old, unless they are consuming more than 500 mL of formula milk a day, as infant formula is fortified with vitamin D.‚Äô The guidance states that children aged 1‚Äì4 years should receive a daily vitamin D supplement of 10 mcg (400 IU). Separately, the RCPCH has said that parents should consider continuing the same vitamin D dose in children aged over 4 years, particularly through the winter months. These recommendations differ slightly from those of the Endocrine Society.

UK Government advice recommends that all children aged 6 months to 5 years are given vitamin supplements containing vitamins A, C, and D; these vitamin drops are free for children who qualify for the Healthy Start programme. Despite this guidance, most children do not receive vitamin D supplementation or achieve recommended intakes through diet and sun exposure, and rickets is now returning in children.

### Hidden Comorbidities

The NHS recommends caution with vitamin D supplements in certain individuals, such as those with kidney disease or sarcoidosis. Some conditions that preclude vitamin D supplementation will not be known at the time of prescribing, so care is required.

**Barriers to Implementation**

The biggest challenge in implementing the Endocrine Society guidance will be ensuring that clinicians understand that this guideline applies to asymptomatic, healthy people, and that its recommendations are not generalisable to other groups with, or at risk of, chronic diseases for which measurement of 25(OH) vitamin D or different dosing or treatment recommendations may be appropriate. The importance of this cannot be overstated.

Some of the further challenges that UK clinicians may have to overcome if they choose to implement the Endocrine Society guidelines are covered in the following sections.

### Obtaining Vitamin D From Natural Sources

Vitamin D is only found in significant amounts naturally in oily fish and egg yolk, with a small amount in some meats, including offal; however, some fat spreads, breakfast cereals, and yoghurts are fortified with vitamin D in the UK. Vitamin D is also made in the skin via the action of sunlight but, in the UK, UVB light in the necessary wavelength is only available between March and September. Sun avoidance may mean that some people do not make significant amounts of vitamin D in their skin; normal sunscreen use, often used at lower coverage than recommended, does not block vitamin D production, but high-factor sunscreens used on all exposed skin may compromise vitamin D status. Therefore, it is likely that, without supplementation, much of the population will not be achieving the Endocrine Society guideline‚Äôs DRIs for vitamin D of 600 IU for those aged under 70 years and 800 IU for those aged 70 years and over. Even meeting the daily RNI of 10 mcg (400 IU) recommended by the SACN may be challenging.

The UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) assesses the diet, nutrient intake, and nutritional status of people aged over 1.5 years living in private homes in the UK. Using a threshold of <25 nmol/l serum 25(OH) vitamin D, the NDNS found that, over a 4-year rolling programme (2008‚Äì2012), 22% of children aged 11‚Äì18 years, 23% of adults aged 19‚Äì64 years, and 21% of adults aged over 65 years had serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels below this threshold. Among children aged 11‚Äì18 years and adults aged 65 years or older, the proportion of individuals with vitamin D levels below the threshold increased to approximately 40% and 30%, respectively, during winter. Similarly, a longitudinal study of more than 6 million primary care patients in the UK with a mean follow up of 5.4 years demonstrated that one-third of those receiving vitamin D testing had a 25(OH)D level below 30 nmol/l.

### Entrenched Views About Supplementation

Recommendations to supplement vitamin D without measuring 25(OH) vitamin D levels have been in place for many groups in the UK for several years. This may feel counterintuitive if clinicians retain the idea that supplementation works best in those with the lowest blood levels of 25(OH) vitamin D. It will therefore be important to reassure clinicians and their patients that the recommendations in this guideline are based on solid RCT evidence. Indeed, supplementing when appropriate without the costs of testing may be cost-saving‚Äîfor example, in those with prediabetes or during pregnancy. However, the author acknowledges that encouraging extra supplementation may be challenging for those already facing a high daily pill burden.

### Health Inequalities

In the UK in recent years, it has been recommended that people purchase vitamin D supplements from retailers such as pharmacies and supermarkets rather than having them prescribed. This is likely to result in lower supplementation among those living in areas of deprivation, as well as among elderly people, who may not be able to source supplements. Also, variability in the vitamin D content of supplements purchased from different retailers may lead to over- or underdosing.

Despite widespread publicity campaigns aimed at increasing the uptake of the Healthy Start programme (which includes free multivitamin drops containing 400-IU vitamin D) among UK families experiencing deprivation, and despite the programme providing free vitamin D supplements in England during the COVID-19 pandemic, uptake of free supplementation remains low.

### Relevance to the UK

Although the Endocrine Society‚Äôs guideline development group includes researchers from the Netherlands and New Zealand, the remainder of the panel are from the US, and this may impact implementation of the recommendations in the UK. However, the studies in the systematic review informing the guideline have a global reach, and some were carried out in the UK.

**Summary**

The author has met with resistance from other clinicians and her practice population when trying to implement vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy, in infants and young children, and in those at risk of deficiency because of a lack of sunlight exposure. Supplementation in older adults without first measuring 25(OH) vitamin D level has also been challenged because of concerns about the lack of available evidence.

Anecdotally, laboratory teams concerned by escalating requests for 25(OH) vitamin D status have sought to restrict testing to people who are symptomatic or in high-risk groups, often by requesting a detailed history and completion of a complex request form. This is entirely appropriate, but may deter clinicians from requesting testing when it is required. The Endocrine Society guideline may help to decrease inappropriate testing in asymptomatic, healthy people, while reassuring clinicians that those in whom supplementation is recommended can receive it without the need for baseline measurements or monitoring of 25(OH) vitamin D level. Primary care teams have an important role to play in educating people about when vitamin D supplementation is appropriate. The guideline clarifies which groups are likely to benefit, and the level of supplementation to recommend or prescribe.

Key Points

*   Vitamin D status has been associated with a range of musculoskeletal and nonmusculoskeletal conditions, resulting in increased testing for 25(OH) vitamin D and widespread supplementation
*   The updated Endocrine Society guideline offers pragmatic advice on blood testing for 25(OH) vitamin D and vitamin D supplementation in healthy, asymptomatic people
*   This guideline does not apply to people with specific indications for 25(OH) vitamin D testing or vitamin D supplementation, including those with osteoporosis, osteomalacia, or other chronic conditions such as CKD or IBD
*   As the baseline intakes for all groups for which supplementation is not recommended, the Endocrine Society retains the NAM-established DRIs for vitamin D of 600 IU (15 mcg) for those aged 1‚Äì70 years and 800 IU (20 mcg) for those aged ‚â•71 years 
    *   these daily intake recommendations are notably higher than the 10-mcg (400-IU) RNI recommended by the SACN in the UK
*   Based on RCT evidence, the Endocrine Society recommends against routine testing in asymptomatic populations, including people aged ‚â•75 years, with obesity, or with skin pigmentation
*   The guideline recommends supplementation for: 
    *   children and adolescents aged 1‚Äì18 years‚Äîto prevent nutritional rickets and to lower the risk of respiratory infections (other guidelines already recommend supplementation during the first year of life)
    *   people aged ‚â•75 years‚Äîto reduce mortality
    *   during pregnancy‚Äîto reduce the risks of pre-eclampsia, intrauterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality
    *   those with high-risk prediabetes‚Äîto reduce the risk of progression to diabetes
*   'Empiric supplementation' refers to vitamin D intake that exceeds the DRI and is implemented without testing for 25(OH) vitamin D
*   Barriers to implementation of the guideline include entrenched views about who is eligible for supplementation and misconceptions about the evidence base for supplementation without testing.

**Implementation Actions for ICSs**

The following implementation actions are designed to support ICSs with the challenges involved in implementing new guidance at a system level. Our aim is to help you to consider how to deliver improvements to healthcare within the available resources.

*   **Recognise** the considerable implications of and operational issues associated with adopting the Endocrine Society guidance on vitamin D in your area
*   **Consider** establishing a multidisciplinary group to discuss the potential adoption and implementation of this guidance, involving Public Health colleagues, paediatricians, obstetricians, geriatricians, endocrinologists, and GPs
*   **Make clear decisions** on whether, if the guidance is adopted, supplementation is provided via NHS prescription (as some groups for which it is recommended are eligible for free prescriptions), and **explore** the budget and opportunity costs of such decisions
*   **Publish** the outcomes of any local decisions on formulary websites, with an explanation of these decisions and guidance on medication and testing regimens.

ICS=integrated care system

Implementation Actions for Clinical Pharmacists in General Practice

The following implementation actions are designed to assist clinical pharmacists in general practice during patient interactions related to vitamin D supplementation:

*   **conduct a training session**‚Äîas medicine experts, pharmacists are key in communicating new treatment guidelines. Conducting a clinical session can update the multidisciplinary team about vitamin D testing and supplementation effectively, ensuring alignment with current best practice and improving patient care
*   **collaborate with the local integrated care board**‚Äîto align processes with the latest clinical evidence, pharmacists can support the revision and update of protocols on vitamin D testing and supplementation to ensure that they reflect up-to-date guidance, in line with the local formulary and best practice
*   **create educational materials for patients**‚Äîchanges in treatment can lead to patient resistance when previous practices are entrenched. To ensure optimal patient outcomes, pharmacists can provide literature explaining why routine vitamin D blood tests may no longer be necessary, emphasising that these changes align with the latest best practice. For example, AccurRx templates can be created for the team to circulate information to patients as needed
*   **coordinate with local community pharmacies**‚Äîpatients often seek advice from community pharmacies about vitamin D deficiency and supplementation. Ensuring consistent messaging between GP practices and community pharmacies is crucial to avoid patient confusion. Pharmacists working in general practice can distribute new guidance to local pharmacies to guarantee that they are giving patients the most current information.

Glucocorticoids (sometimes known as steroids) fight inflammation and are used to treat a wide range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, cancers and other medical problems.

While they can be very effective in decreasing inflammation, glucocorticoids have many adverse effects including increasing blood sugar levels and causing diabetes. This is more likely when people use glucocorticoid tablets or injections than when used as inhalers, creams or drops.

A new study by researchers at the Diabetes Trials Unit, University of Oxford‚Äôs Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Oxford, UK, investigated how commonly patients being treated with glucocorticoids can develop new-onset diabetes. The study found that patients receiving systemic glucocorticoids were more than twice as likely (2.6 times) to develop diabetes as those not receiving the treatment.

Study leader Dr Rajna Golubic, said: ‚ÄúExisting information on how much more common new diabetes is in patients treated with glucocorticoids is based on small studies including patients with one or a few conditions. We wanted to expand the data to get a more accurate idea of how likely it is that people could develop diabetes while being treated with these drugs.‚Äù

Dr Golubic and colleagues compared the rate of new-onset diabetes in hospital patients who received systemic glucocorticoids (tablets, injections or infusions) to patients not treated with these drugs.

The study involved 451,606 adults (median age 52 years, 55% female, 69% White) who were admitted to the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust between 1 January 2013 and 1 October 2023. All were free from diabetes at the start of the study and none were taking systemic glucocorticoids.

17,258 (3.8%) of the patients were treated with systemic glucocorticoids (some names include prednisolone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone) while in hospital, most commonly for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and for infections.

316 of these 17,258 patients (1.8%) developed diabetes while in hospital. This compares with 3,430 of the 434,348 patients (0.8%) who didn‚Äôt receive systemic glucocorticoids. Patients were typically admitted for less than a week.

Further analysis showed that, when age and sex were factored in, patients receiving systemic glucocorticoids were more than twice as likely (2.6 times) to develop diabetes as those not receiving the treatment.

Dr Golubic says: ‚ÄúThese latest results give clinical staff a better estimate of how likely new diabetes is to occur and could prompt doctors to plan clinical care more effectively to detect and manage new diabetes.

‚ÄúWhile we studied hospital patients, glucocorticoid tablets can be prescribed by GPs for conditions such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis and it is important that they, too, are aware of the link.‚Äù

She added: ‚ÄúThis study also shows how routinely collected clinical data can be used to help people with diabetes.‚Äù

A patient-tailored therapy of the heterogeneous, neuropsychiatric disorder of Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) aims to improve dopamine sensitive motor symptoms and associated non-motor features. A repeated, individual adaptation of dopamine substituting compounds is required throughout the disease course due to the progress of neurodegeneration. Therapeutic drug monitoring of dopamine substituting drugs may be an essential tool to optimize drug applications. We suggest plasma determination of levodopa as an initial step. The complex pharmacology of levodopa is influenced by its short elimination half-life and the gastric emptying velocity. Both considerably contribute to the observed variability of plasma concentrations of levodopa and its metabolite 3-O-methyldopa. These amino acids compete with other aromatic amino acids as well as branched chain amino acids on the limited transport capacity in the gastrointestinal tract and the blood brain barrier. However, not much is known about plasma concentrations of levodopa and other drugs/drug combinations in PD. Some examples may illustrate this lack of knowledge: Levodopa measurements may allow further insights in the phenomenon of inappropriate levodopa response. They may result from missing compliance, interactions e.g. with treatments for other mainly age-related disorders, like hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, rheumatism or by patients themselves independently taken herbal medicines. Indeed, uncontrolled combination of compounds for accompanying disorders as given above with PD drugs might increase the risk of side effects. Determination of other drugs used to treat PD in plasma such as dopamine receptor agonists, amantadine and inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase or monoamine oxidase B may refine and improve the value of calculations of levodopa equivalents. How COMT-Is change levodopa plasma concentrations? How other dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic drugs influence levodopa levels? Also, delivery of drugs as well as single and repeated dosing and continuous levodopa administrations with a possible accumulation of levodopa, pharmacokinetic behaviour of generic and branded compounds appear to have a marked influence on efficacy of drug treatment and side effect profile. Their increase over time may reflect progression of PD to a certain degree. Therapeutic drug monitoring in PD is considered to improve the therapeutic efficacy in the course of this devastating neurologic disorder and therefore is able to contribute to the patients‚Äô precision medicine. State-of-the-art clinical studies are urgently needed to demonstrate the usefulness of TDM for optimizing the treatment of PD.

Introduction

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is essential in epilepsy, but it has not yet been established for the clinical practice in patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) (Hiemke et al. 2018). To enhance therapeutic efficacy and tolerability, determination of plasma levels of PD drugs recently gained more and more importance in the development of substances with an improved pharmacokinetic profile. Typical examples are extended release formulations of dopamine agonists, add on of amantadine and new intrajejunal or subcutaneous as well as inhalation formulations of levodopa particularly (Modi et al. 2019a; Rosebraugh et al. 2021; Marmol et al. 2021; LeWitt et al. 2022). The AGNP consensus guidelines for TDM already suggest therapeutic reference ranges of several antiparkinsonian drugs, only based on available pharmacokinetic properties of these neurologic drugs (Hiemke et al. 2018). In these guidelines, blood sample for several antiparkinsonian drugs is mostly suggested at tmax, the time of maximal drug concentrations (Cmax), as most of these drugs have a short elimination half-life, or if data at trough level conditions were not available. Nevertheless, TDM has not been established so far for antiparkinsonian drugs used in PD. This is surprising because PD is an aging-related devastating disorder, frequently combined with other diseases such as hypertonia, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, rheumatism and others with their special drug treatment regimes.

Nutritional aspects

Indeed, the pharmacokinetics of levodopa depend on several parameters, like health condition, nutritional aspects (interaction with protein-rich meals), gastrointestinal (GI) absorption and transfer via the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Levodopa competes with large neutral amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine. leucine, isoleucine) for the mechanism of absorption and brain uptake (Cedarbaum 1987; Riederer 1980, Kessel and Aidy 2019).

Gastrointestinal barriers to levodopa transport and absorption include dysphagia, delayed gastric emptying, constipation, Helicobacter pylori infection, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and gut dysbiosis (Leta et al. 2023). Levodopa is absorbed in the small intestine, where transit time is approximately three hours and plasma elimination half-life is short. Therefore, gastric emptying is a major determining factor for onset of symptom relief (Nyholm and Lennern√§s 2008). Evidences on the gut microbiota-derived amino acid metabolism alterations associated with PD have been published by Wang et al. (2022).

Of note, specific gut bacteria might interfere with the bioavailability of levodopa (Kessel and Aidy 2019; Zhong et al. 2023; Beckers et al. 2022) as is the gastric acidity (Jenkins et al. 1973). Disorders of the gastrointestinal tract can adversely affect levodopa absorption and lead to Off-periods (Pfeiffer et al. 2020). GI disorders and GI resection may change the pharmacokinetics of levodopa (Nagayama et al. 2015). Drug-nutrient interactions between levodopa and enteral feedings are an important issue and may lead to decrease of clinical benefit of levodopa especially in critically ill patients (Cooper et al. 2008). Also, On‚ÄìOff-phases in PD have been related to levodopa absorption and transport (Nutt et al. 1984). Notably, high protein meals or oral large neutral amino acids (LNAA) reverse the therapeutic effect of infused levodopa without reducing plasma levodopa concentration (Nutt et al. 1984; see also Molina et al. 1997; Pincus and Barry 1987). Application of subcutaneous and intestinal levodopa/carbidopa infusion systems is less complex and probably cheaper when combined with a COMT-I, i.e. opicapone with its one time daily intake scenario, from the beginning. It is well known that COMT-I reduce 3-OMD, which competes with levodopa transporter system, particularly at the blood brain barrier but also in the gastrointestinal tract in case of jejunal levodopa application. Therefore, nutritional interventions should be planned with regard to a nutritional balance designed to prevent weight loss or -gain, optimization of levodopa pharmacokinetics, avoidance of interactions with proteins and improvement in gastrointestinal dysfunction (Barichella et al. 2009). Indeed, protein restriction diets, low protein diet and levodopa administration long before any meals or even better after nutritional intake is considered to be a strategy to avoid decreased levodopa brain uptake (Barichella et al. 2009; Boelens Keun et al. 2021; Rusch et al. 2023; Eriksson et al. 1988; Murata 2006). The improvement in clinical response varied from 30% in patients with protein redistribution to 82% in those with low-protein diets (Virmani et al. 2016; Bracco et al. 1991). Indeed, small variations in plasma LNAAs in comparison with the large variations in plasma levodopa indicates that in this case LNAAs are of less importance to the fluctuating response to levodopa (Nutt et al. 1989). In addition, the metabolite of levodopa, 3-O-methyldopa, inhibits brain uptake of the parent compound (Nutt et al. 1987). Therefore, peripherally acting COMT-inhibitors are suggested to avoid this interaction.

Drug-Drug interactions

For example, cardiovascular symptoms occur in PD and orthostatic hypotension is a frequent symptom (Jost 2020; Jost et al. 2020; Jost and Br√ºck 2002). Of note, blood pressure in a 250 mg and 375 mg levodopa/benserazide group of older patients with PD in the early and middle stages, decreased significantly in the lying and standing positions (Su et al. 2023). However, arterial hypertension is also a symptom to be considered for drug therapy. Bitner et al. (2015) propose prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antagonists of AT1-receptor for angiotensin II, or antagonists of √ü-adrenoceptors (√ü-adrenolytics) as first-line agents of antihypertensive treatment in PD patients receiving levodopa /benserazide. Their analysis revealed a lack of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (Bitner et al. 2015). In association with levodopa the dose of the potent antihypertensive drug guanethidine had to be reduced substantially (Hunter et al. 1970).

Diuretics and beta-blockers are still among the first-line medications for arterial hypertension, but both groups of substances should be used with caution in PD patients, among other things because of orthostatic hypotension (Jost and Br√ºck 2002; Lee et al. 2014).

In the MPTP-treated two monkeys an intraperitoneal injection of the √ü-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol increased the blood-to-brain transport of levodopa (Alexander et al. 1994).

Anticholinergic drugs markedly delay gastric emptying and thus may reduce the therapeutic benefit from levodopa (Bianchine and Sunyapridakul 1973).

Potential drug-drug interactions in hospitalized patients with PD exhibiting multiple comorbidities, hospitalized in a neurodegenerative ward and/or taking antidepressants or antipsychotic drugs, with levodopa can be expected (Aleksic et al. 2021). Caution is recommended when antidepressants are given in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (Nieuwstraten et al. 2006; Edwards 1982; Chen et al. 2023). However, this primarily affects MAO-A inhibitors and only to a very limited extent the MAO-B inhibitors used in PD.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-Is) belong to the earliest drugs tried in PD with and without levodopa (Bernheimer et al. 1962). Due to their side effect/adverse reaction profile unspecific MAO-Is have limited use in the treatment of depression in PD (Teychenne et al. 1975), while selective, reversible MAO-A inhibitors are recommended (Riederer and Laux 2011). The selective, irreversible MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline are used to treat akinesia and motor fluctuations as is with the selective, reversible MAO-B inhibitor safinamide. Selegiline has been marketed as tablet and melting tablet for PD and as transdermal selegiline for depression, while rasagiline and safinamide are recommended for the treatment of PD (Riederer and Laux 2011; Flockhart 2012; Dezsi and Vecsei 2017; Tabi et al. 2020; Asano 2023; Robakis and Fahn 2015). Concurrent administration of selegiline and selective serotonin uptake inhibitors should be avoided due to the possible development of the serotonin syndrome (Ritter and Alexander 1997; Frenklach 2016). Hypertensive crises and the serotonin syndrome can occur in rare cases due to interactions between MAO-Is and food containing tyramine as well as interactions with serotoninergic and sympathomimetic agents (Flockhart 2012; Livingstone and Livingstone 1996). No dietary restrictions, however, are imposed and no hypertensive crises result when MAO-B inhibitors are used in combination with levodopa (Flockhart 2012; Riederer and Laux 2011).

Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) has been shown to decrease the effects of levodopa. However, this effect is not seen when levodopa is prescribed in combination with a decarboxylase inhibitor (Mars 1974; Sulli and Ezzo 2007).

Diabetes has been shown also to be frequently associated with PD (Sandyk 1993). Mainly type 2 diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for the onset and progression of both, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and PD (Cardoso and Moreira 2020). Therefore, antidiabetic drugs are administered and might interfere with levodopa treatment even in pancreatic cells. Of interest, metformin in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned mouse model of PD normalized the increased glycogen synthase kinase-3√ü activity induced by chronic treatment with levodopa. Thus, metformin may have therapeutic potential for the suppression or management of levodopa-induced motor complications in patients with PD (Ryu et al. 2018), but see Ping et al (2020). Intranasal insulin, metformin and thiazolidinediones are used in PD (Cardoso and Moreira 2020).

Cholesterol-lowering drugs are used in PD to antagonize enhanced cholesterol or lipid-related disorders in order to improve cognitive abilities (Roy and Pahan 2011). In their experimental study in a chronic MPTP-model of PD Roy and Pahan (2011) demonstrated that simvastatin, which crosses the BBB and negatively correlates with the incidence of PD, shows efficacy in this animal model of PD.

The disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine have been shown to be associated with a decreased risk of PD (Paakinaho et al. 2022), whereas centrally acting calcium antagonists, i.e. amlodipine, are at least under suspicion to influence progression respectively the risk for PD onset (Lee et al. 2014; Ritz et al. 2010; Sempere et al. 1995).

Patients taking levodopa suggest that digoxin, diuretics, phenindione, cyclizin, dichloralphenazone, barbiturates, general anaesthetics, chlorpropamide, insulin, dexamphetamines, ampicillin, sulphadimidine, antacids, prednisolone, thyroxine and paracetamol can safely be given in association with levodopa (Hunter et al. 1970).

Uncontrolled combination of all these drugs with antiparkinsonian medications might interfere with levodopa, plasma concentrations and may increase the risk for side effects as there exists an inter individual pharmacokinetic variability of the drugs in patients (Preskorn et al. 1993; Preskorn 2008). TDM is able to optimize drug treatment on a personal basis, reduces the risk for drug-drug interactions substantially, controls dose regimes, proves compliance, contributes to clarify non-response at therapeutic doses, improves drug adherence and suboptimal tolerability. In the case of fos-levodopa/fos-carbidopa administration, change of dosing of alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity influencing drugs, such as antidiabetics or anticonvulsants, may influence the dephosphorylation capacity of fos-levodopa/fos-carbidopa to L-dopa/carbidopa.

Therefore, TDM in PD is helpful to optimize ‚Äúprecision medicine‚Äù in this disorder. Indeed TDM has been shown since decades to improve the therapeutic outcome on an individual basis in neuropsychiatric patients (Adli et al. 2005; Trivedi et al. 2007; Ceskova 2014; de LJ 2014; Shin et al. 2016). Therefore, it is our aim to further stimulate the idea to use TDM in optimizing treatment strategies particular in PD but also in neurology in general. Notably, methodology for the calculation of reference values can be followed in the detailed description by Hiemke et al. (2018). An update can be expected in 2024/2025.

Levodopa

The current scientific interests particularly focus on monitoring levodopa in plasma. Levodopa is the most efficacious PD drug and well tolerated. Its short half-life lasts between 30 to 90 min. This fast metabolism rate gives rise to fluctuations of levodopa plasma concentrations over the day. The peripheral rise and fall of levodopa after oral administration in plasma is translated into pulsatile dopamine brain levels after the levodopa transport via the blood brain barrier and its presynaptic dopa decarboxylase mediated conversion to dopamine. Such levodopa-induced fluctuations of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system counteract the physiological principle of continuous dopaminergic stimulation. Studies of the normal function of basal ganglia interaction have demonstrated that nigral dopaminergic neurons normally fire continuously and that striatal dopamine concentrations are relatively constant (Stocchi 2009). In MPTP treated monkeys, pulsatile stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors with short-lasting agents is associated with the induction of molecular and physiologic changes in basal ganglia neurons and the development of motor complications (Stocchi 2009; Chase 1998). Therefore, continuous delivery of levodopa might be associated with a reduced risk of motor complications (Olanow et al. 2020; Pirtosek et al. 2023; van Warmelen et al. 2018; Nutt et al. 2000; Nyholm 2007; Metman et al. 2001). Nevertheless, the understanding of the mechanisms behind the complications of long-term levodopa treatment (especially in advanced PD) is still not complete (Timpka et al. 2016; Antonini 2007). The way in which drugs are delivered in PD appears to have a marked influence on both efficacy and side effect profile. Therefore, the concept of ‚Äúcontinuous drug delivery‚Äù has been arisen (Gershanik and Jenner 2012).

This paradigm of dopamine substitution is regarded as an essential component for adequate motor behaviour in PD patients with loss of motor function and motor complications. The increase in loss of compensating capacity is due to the progression of PD. This balance decline eases onset of fluctuations of movement and associated non motor symptoms, both of which are mainly related to the oral application of levodopa/ peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDI) formulations. Thus, they are looked upon as mainly responsible for the pulsatility of levodopa, or brain dopamine, under repeated oral dosing. Accordingly, the so-called fluctuation index (FI) of levodopa is looked upon especially for scientific reasons (Ferreira et al. 2013) as a measure of the magnitude of rise and fall of levodopa in plasma relative to the average concentration. The lower the FI, the more the maximum levodopa concentration (Cmax) is associated to the plasma levodopa trough (Cmin). Therefore, in the long term, a low FI may minimize onset of potential Cmax related adverse effects, such as dyskinesia. These involuntary movements are the consequence of an over stimulation of the progressed degenerated nigrostriatal dopaminergic system with levodopa. Accordingly, clinical researchers focused on the pharmacokinetic behaviour of orally applied levodopa preparations following single and repeated dosing. Their results underlined the importance of measuring levodopa plasma concentrations to control the fluctuations. A reference value Cmax of 900 -2000 ng/ml has been reported (Hiemke et al. 2018) suggesting rather a rough value of expectation. Table 1 only reports a selection of pharmacokinetic studies on levodopa/DDI formulations with PD patients (except: Rosebraugh et al. 2022). Body weight and inhibition of levodopa metabolizing enzymes, such as catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), may contribute to the observed data variability, which also results from an individually differing gastrointestinal absorption and genetic individuality (Fermaglich and O'Doherty 1972; Nyholm & Lennernas 2008; Muller 2013; Lipp et al. 2016; Leta et al. 2023). Data from healthy volunteers should not be considered because chronic dopamine substitution interferes with gastrointestinal motility (Fermaglich and O'Doherty 1972). It causes a delay of gastric emptying. Chronic dopamine substitution with gastrointestinal dopamine receptor stimulation delays absorption of an oral levodopa formulation in the duodenal tract. Therefore, pharmacokinetic data of healthy volunteers may considerably differ from long term levodopa treated PD patients. Additionally, pharmacokinetic data (not reference values) reported in Table 1, also mirror the fact that the performance of investigations, or the reporting of results in the literature on levodopa in plasma are not standardized. Therefore, these data can be used to further improve the Cmax reference values in an updated version of the Hiemke et al. (2018) publication, as suggested for 2024/2025. Some trials reported median-, others mean values. Area-under-the-curve (AUC) outcomes were calculated over differing, sometimes over intervals which were not even mentioned. In case of repeated drug intake, varying intake times were chosen. A further problem is response to levodopa, as no real objective and reliable assessment of the impaired motor behaviour is possible in treated PD patients, even after an overnight withdrawal of dopamine substituting compounds. Indeed, concomitantly applied dopamine substitution, i.e. with dopamine agonists that possess a half-life of up to 24 h, may considerably bias the clinical assessment of motor symptoms. The situation is similar when PD drugs are applied in a continuous fashion by a patch (rotigotine) or as an infusion (levodopa intestinal gel, ND0612 or foslevodopa). Thus, the situation differs from other neurological, or psychiatric conditions in clinical practice, i.e., in epilepsy with the possibility of objective electroencephalography recordings to determine the likelihood of seizures. Therefore, TDM may indeed be helpful to optimize drug treatment in PD.

Reliable reference ranges are currently under investigation

For levodopa the AGNP-TDM consensus guideline defines a reference range of 0.9‚Äì2.0 ¬µg/mL in blood sample 1 h after 250 mg levodopa combined with 25 mg carbidopa (Hiemke et al. 2018). For levodopa, a moderate correlation between drug concentrations in blood and short-term clinical response is considered (Nutt & Fellman 1984). Overall, however, the literature is not consistent in terms of reference ranges with upper and lower threshold values as an essential precondition for an adequate motor response (Contin et al. 1999; Stocchi et al. 2005; Contin & Martinelli 2010). One may hypothesize that continuous subcutaneous delivery of levodopa/carbidopa (ND0612 or foslevodopa) will probably need lower levels in PD patients. Infusion systems circumvent the gastrointestinal tract. The principle of continuous levodopa administration with a possible accumulation, or a cautious titration to a steady state of plasma levodopa, may represent an essential component for the efficacy of the drug after its active transport over the blood brain barrier. Therefore, reliable reference values are currently under investigation. Accordingly, determinations of plasma levodopa in a TDM setting may gain more importance in the near future. In this respect a more standardised calculation of levodopa plasma levels may allow clinicians to differentiate better between branded and generic levodopa formulations. In the past years the impact of health care authorities, -politicians and payers went up in terms of drug cost reduction. Various approaches of not transparent price regulation scenarios of country specific healthcare system increasingly influence drug selection and accordingly limit therapeutic options. Generally this system supports prescription of cheaper, generic available drugs, however these compounds considerably vary in their pharmacokinetic behaviour. In Germany, even the pharmacist may switch between generic and branded compounds without information of the prescribing neurologists. Therefore, the efficacy of a personalised PD drug treatment cocktail may change, particularly, when compounds with a short half-life are applied. Therefore, effects of oral levodopa formulations are particularly altered by differences between original and the various generic available oral levodopa formulations. This scenario is due to country specific, sometimes even regional different, not transparent drug price reduction- and discount procedures. It is supplemented by direct or hidden modes of budget limitations for prescribing neurologists, i.e. in Germany. Therefore, TDM for the various levodopa formulations in a defined, strictly standardised fashion will particularly gain importance in the future to counteract this currently ongoing development, which may provide harm to patients even in terms of drug safety.

The impact of COMT

Enzymatic blocking of levodopa metabolism with COMT-inhibitors (COMT-I) additionally influences plasma bioavailability of levodopa. Table 2 shows that COMT-I increases the median levels of levodopa. Median concentrations are here reported, as they are not so sensitive to outliers compared to means. Data were taken from previously published pharmacokinetic trials (M√ºller et al. 2006; Muhlack et al. 2014; M√ºller et al. 2022). These investigations have in common that PD patients received no other PD drug overnight, only 100 mg levodopa/25 mg carbidopa with and without COMT-inhibitor in the currently approved and thus applied dosing (200 mg entacapone with each levodopa dose, or tolcapone 100 mg t.i.d. or 50 mg opicapone o.i.d) and showed a positive motor response to the levodopa administration during the investigation interval. Only the outcomes of the determinations at baseline, 60, 120 and 180 min after drug intake were taken for this analysis, as these moments were the same in all these trials. Co-medication with 50 mg opicapone with its more consistent COMT-blocking enhanced the median AUC levels of levodopa by 370% compared to 55 and 53% with addition of 200 mg entacapone and 100 mg tolcapone, respectively (Table 2). Effects on Cmax showed a tendency for an increase with 200 mg entacapone and 100 mg tolcapone only but a substantial one for 50 mg opicapone. The SEM values reflect the high variability of levodopa in plasma bioavailability across PD patients (M√ºller, 2010a; b). As aforementioned, branded and generic oral levodopa formulations considerably differ in terms of pharmacokinetic behaviour. Authorities define bio equivalence with differences within the range of 80% and 125% of the original formulation. Therefore, the dispersion width of the various available generic formulations varies up to 45% (M√ºller, 2022). If they are introduced by the pharmacist only, as in Germany, the efficacy of a patient tailored PD drug regimen can markedly decline. However, clinicians point out that effects of oral levodopa applications are considerably influenced by even minimal differences between original and the various generic oral levodopa formulations (see Table 1) (M√ºller, 2022). This can easily be shown by measuring plasma levels of levodopa. Additionally, genetic subtypes of plasma transporter proteins, such as orosomucoid, may contribute to the variability of levodopa plasma concentrations (Weidinger et al. 1987). Therapeutic reference ranges of entacapone (0.4‚Äì1.0 ¬µg/ml 1 h after intake) and tolcapone (3‚Äì6 ¬µg/ml 2 h after intake) are proposed in the AGNP guidelines, based solely on pharmacokinetic properties (Hiemke et al. 2018). However, as COMT-Is are not administered without levodopa, TDM of COMT-Is is not recommended.

Dopamine agonist plasma levels in PD patients

It is mandatory for approval of a dopamine agonist (DA) to provide pharmacokinetic data, including bioavailability and elimination half-life. Pharmacokinetic trials, however, are usually performed in healthy volunteers. Comparisons between approved and new delivery formulations are also common even in PD patients, (for an example see Hattori et al. 2012). They aim to demonstrate non inferiority in terms of bioavailability and absence of a significant impact on levodopa pharmacokinetics (Deleu et al. 2002; Tompson & Vearer 2007). One of the best and most investigated compound is rotigotine because of its transdermal application route (Montastruc et al. 1991; Nicolle et al. 1993; Persiani et al. 1994; van et al., 1995; Kaye & Nicholls 2000; Hubble & Novak 2001; Del & Bonuccelli 2003; Elshoff et al. 2012; Cawello et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2018). A second rotigotine patch is now on the market, which differs in both the patch size and the rotigotine load (Jost et al. 2024). The data situation is currently not sufficient. Generally the clinical pharmacokinetics of ergoline and non-ergoline DA are poorly characterized in PD patients (Friis et al. 1979). In one trial, blood sample for measurement of DA plasma concentrations were drawn in the morning at a median 18 h-distance from the last DA intake with pramipexole, ropinirole or transdermal rotigotine (the latter does not show a first-pass effect). The high inter subject variability in plasma concentrations under the same dosage may implicate that monitoring DA plasma levels could also be helpful in the individualization of treatment (Contin et al. 2019). However, both data on pharmacokinetic effects of the DA on levodopa or valid therapeutic ranges under steady state conditions, are not available for the clinical practice in PD patients, i.e. to control expected absorption problems. For piribedil, a reference value of 10‚Äì30 ng/ml was proposed (Ziegler et al. 1994; Montastruc et al. 1999). A reference value between 4 and 10 ng/ml was mentioned for apomorphine (Agbo et al. 2021; Kim et al. 2022). The AGNP guidelines published the following reference ranges: for bromocriptine (low dose (2.5 mg): 0.1‚Äì0.3 ng/ml; max. dose (25 mg): 1.0‚Äì4.0 ng/ml; trough level), cabergoline (58‚Äì144 pg/ml 0.5‚Äì4 h after drug intake for 4 weeks), pramipexole (0.4‚Äì7.2 ng/ml; trough-level), ropinirole (0.4‚Äì6.0 ng/ml; trough-level) and rotigotine (0.1‚Äì0.7 ng/ml; trough-level).

However, dopamine receptor agonists at optimum doses to improve motor behaviour of patients with PD have lost importance. This is due to their increasing neuropsychiatric side effect profile as PD progresses. As a consequence, these drugs are used at low doses in the early phase of PD only, but are used most frequently as add-on medication to levodopa treatment. In this context, TDM of dopaminergic receptor agonists is not helpful.

Anticholinergic/-muscarinergic PD drugs

Amelioration of tremor in PD with anticholinergic compounds is nowadays rarely performed. To our best knowledge clinical pharmacokinetics or therapeutic levels of anticholinergics in PD patients are scarcely available. Solely the AGNP consensus guidelines published a therapeutic reference range for biperiden (1‚Äì6.5 ng/ml 0.5-2 h after intake of 4 mg) and bornaprin (0.7‚Äì7.2 ng/ml 1‚Äì2 h after intake of 4 mg) (Hiemke et al. 2018). No relevant impact of administration of anticholinergics on levodopa pharmacokinetics has been described similar to dopamine agonists, i.e. ropinirole (Contin et al. 1991; Deleu et al. 2002; Adamiak-Giera et al. 2021).

Drug monitoring of amantadine

Three mechanisms of action might explain the efficacy of amantadine in PD. Preclinical data demonstrate differential modulation of the dopamine system. Inhibition of dopamine reuptake and stimulation of central dopa-decarboxylase activity may be clinically relevant, as they support dopaminergic neurotransmission. Accordingly, presynaptic and postsynaptic actions of amantadine at dopaminergic terminals and release of intraneuronal dopamine from extravesicular stores have been reported. Amantadine also inhibits the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors particularly during high dosing. A mild anticholinergic effect is also well known (Fisher et al. 1998; Deleu et al. 2002; Danysz et al. 2021). In view of these complex pharmacologic and thus also pharmacodynamic effects it is secondary to establish TDM for amantadine in clinical practice. A therapeutic reference range of amantadine (300‚Äì600 ng/ml, trough level) has been proposed (Hiemke et al. 2018), but there is no data for both, amantadine HCL and amantadine SO4.

Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors

Levodopa is transformed by dopa-decarboxylase to dopamine within dopamine synthesizing neurons mostly. Central dopamine turnover is predominantly catalysed by the enzymes COMT and MAO in neuronal and glial cells. MAO is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Two enzyme forms of MAO exist. They are classified as MAO-A and MAO-B and differ in terms of preferred substrates. MAO-A mostly degrades serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, placenta, gut and liver. MAO-B metabolizes preferentially phenylethylamine, methylhistamine and tryptamine in glial brain cells neighbouring dopaminergic synapses, liver and platelets. Both MAO subtypes are also involved in tyramine- and dopamine metabolism (Tabi et al. 2020). MAO-inhibitors generally reduce the turnover of biogenic amines. Inhibition of one MAO isoform activity is only enabled within a rather low concentration range of the applied drug. This specific inhibition pattern changes with higher drug dosing. Then a total blockade of both MAO isoforms occurs. Thus MAO-B enzyme activity contributes to regulation of storage, release and occurrence of free concentrations of biogenic amines in the synaptic cleft. There are three compounds available. Selegiline is quickly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Main derivatives of selegiline are desmethylselegiline, methamphetamine and L-amphetamine. Selegiline is applied once or twice daily, in 5 mg tablets up to 10 mg, mostly 7.5 mg are administered (Birkmayer et al. 1975). Rasagiline is also well absorbed (Finberg & Youdim 2002). one hour following administration of an oral rasagiline formulation, inhibition of MAO-B activity was found in platelets. This effect lasted for at least 48 h and then returned to baseline after two weeks. Rasagiline is degraded to aminoindane. Rasagiline is orally applied once daily in a dosage of 1 mg. Safinamide is a reversible MAO-B inhibitor and selegiline and rasagiline are irreversible inhibitors. Safinamide is well and quickly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. The maximum plasma concentration was observed within 2‚Äì4 h after oral intake. Extensive metabolism of safinamide via amide hydrolytic oxidation generates safinamide acid as main derivative. Further less important metabolites are formed, such as O-debenzylated safinamide. Safinamide is administered in a dosage of 50 or 100 mg once daily (M√ºller and Foley 2017). TDM with MAO-B inhibitors will only make sense in terms of the determination of MAO-B enzyme inhibition for the clinical practice, as the enzyme inhibition considerably varies as shown in the periphery (M√ºller et al., 2017). Furthermore, for irreversible MAO-B inhibitors, drug concentrations in blood do not correlate with clinical effects due to irreversible blockade of an enzyme. Therefore, TDM is not recommended for dose titration, but may be potentially useful for special indications or problem solving (Hiemke et al. 2018).

Outlook

Currently, therapeutic drug monitoring is not a well-developed research field for the treatment of PD patients in contrast to other disease entities, such as epilepsy. Though TDM has the potential to improve efficacy and tolerability of PD drugs, it is so far not used in clinical practice. For example, antiparkinsonian drugs exhibit concentration dependent properties, and TDM may detect non-adherence or pharmacokinetic abnormalities due to genotype or pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (Hiemke et al. 2018). To our best knowledge, COMT gene mutations have no impact on levodopa plasma levels (Muller 2010a, 2010b). As aforementioned, the main investigations on plasma bioavailability of levodopa are available in PD and summarized in Table 1. This table also shows that AUC- and Cmax values considerably differ in pharmacokinetic trials, even when the same compound, i.e. immediate release Sinemet¬Æ (100 mg levodopa/25 mg carbidopa) were administered. Therefore a standardized procedure for determination of plasma levodopa is essential. The cited references also have in common that they do not even consider the existing rough clinical differentiation of PD in subtypes with predominant tremor or akinesia and rigidity or equivalent expression of akinesia, rigidity and tremor. Treatment of these subtypes may differ in terms of tremor amelioration, i.e. with antimuscarinic compounds. They may influence gastrointestinal motility and thus finally delay levodopa absorption after its transport from the stomach to duodenal structures, where levodopa absorption predominantly takes place. Moreover, PD related syndromes, such as progressive supra nuclear palsy or multi system atrophy, do in fact exist. Their diagnosis-complementing features also include a weakened or even missing levodopa response in addition to a vast and broad literature on neuropathological and morphological imaging findings. However to date, reliable investigations on the gastrointestinal absorption and plasma bioavailability of levodopa, or its transport via the blood brain barrier with levodopa- and dopamine determinations in cerebrospinal fluid, are rare (Veronneau-Veilleux et al. 2020, 2021). Simultaneous levodopa assessment in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid may also serve as a future capacity marker of blood brain barrier transporters to shuttle biogenic amines into the brain and for the central regulation of the central turnover of levodopa to dopamine via central dopa-decarboxylase in addition to these more hypothetical model calculations (Veronneau-Veilleux et al. 2020, 2021). One may hypothesize that these investigations may facilitate drug titration with levodopa containing formulations and finally shorten in-patient stays. These measurements to be established in the future may also complement and improve calculations on levodopa equivalents as a measure of disease progression in PD (Jost et al. 2023). This would enable the definition of new, more precise and also more clinical relevant endpoints over trials lasting many years on disease modification. It is well known that enzyme blockers, such as inhibitors of COMT elevate peripheral plasma levodopa, or MAO-B-inhibitors increase central biogenic amines. On the one hand measurement of their plasma concentrations may have limited value for clinicians due to their limited dosing scenarios based on pivotal study results. On the other hand future outcomes from therapeutic drug monitoring in association with an individually determined enzyme blocking potency may open the possibility for an individual optimised dosing, i.e. of rasagiline or safinamide, since safety and tolerability data on higher dosages with 2 mg resp. 200 mg exist, as for example (Stocchi et al. 2012).

Conclusion

Therapeutic drug monitoring in PD has not so far not been established. Clinicians determine the dosing and the efficacy of an applied PD drug combination in relation to the clinical response, predominantly the motor behaviour. For instance, among others, an important influencing factor is body weight, or the body mass index. In addition, nutritional aspects, gastrointestinal emptying, consideration of accompanying drug treatment strategies in older patients with multiple health problems other than PD will be a matter of TDM future developments, i.e. to exclude absorption problems, to determine metabolism rate and as a tool to detect compliance problems. Further advantages of TDM in PD were already highlighted in the introduction to this text. Based on actual knowledge and known problems associated with the highly variable plasma levels of antiparkinsonian drugs, TDM in PD patients has the potential to become an important tool for individualized assessment of levodopa plasma bioavailability in particular for the clinical practice. Here TDM will help to determine the aforementioned, still underestimated diversity between original ""branded"" and the various generic PD drug formulations (see Table 1) in the future. This will perhaps convince authorities, health politicians and financial services that various PD drug preparations, containing the same amount of active ingredients, should not indiscriminately be exchanged for pricing reasons.

Some patients even experienced a 10,000-fold improvement in their vision after receiving the highest dose of the therapy, according to researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who co-led the clinical trial published in _[The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736/(24/)01447-8/fulltext_.

‚ÄúThat 10,000-fold improvement is the same as a patient being able to see their surroundings on a moonlit night outdoors as opposed to requiring bright indoor lighting before treatment,‚Äù said the study‚Äôs lead author, [Artur Cideciyan, PhD](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p4805), a research professor of Ophthalmology and co-director of the Center for Hereditary Retinal Degenerations. ‚ÄúOne patient reported for the first time being able to navigate at midnight outdoors only with the light of a bonfire.‚Äù

A total of 15 people participated in the Phase 1/2 trial, including three pediatric patients. Each patient had [Leber congenital amaurosis](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/leber-congenital-amaurosis/) as the result of mutations in the _GUCY2D_ gene, which is essential to producing proteins critical for vision. This specific condition, which affects less than 100,000 people worldwide and is abbreviated as LCA1, causes significant amount of vision loss as early as infancy.

All subjects had severe vision loss with their best measure of vision being equal or worse than 20/80‚Äîmeaning if a typically-sighted person could see an object clearly at 80 feet, these patients would have to move up to at least 20 feet to see it. Glasses provide limited benefit to these patients because they correct abnormalities in the optical focusing ability of the eye, and are unable to address medical causes of vision loss, such as genetic retinal diseases like LCA1.

The trial tested different dosage levels of the gene therapy, ATSN-101, which was adapted from the AAV5 microorganism and was surgically injected under the retina. For the first part of the study, cohorts of three adults each received one of the three different dosages: Low, mid, and high. Evaluations were held between each level of dosage to ensure that they were safe before upping the dosage for the next cohort. A second phase of the study involved only administering the high dosage levels to both an adult cohort of three and a pediatric cohort of three, again after safety reviews of the previous cohorts.

Improvements were noticed quickly, often within the first month, after the therapy was applied and lasted for at least 12 months. Observations of participating patients are also ongoing. Three of six high-dosage patients who were tested to navigate a mobility course in varying levels of light achieved the maximum-possible score. Other tests used eye charts or measured the dimmest flashes of light patients perceived in a dark environment.

Of the nine patients who received the maximum dosage, two had the 10,000-fold improvement in vision.

‚ÄúEven though we previously predicted a large vision improvement potential in LCA1, we did not know how receptive patients‚Äô photoreceptors would be to treatment after decades of blindness,‚Äù said Cideciyan. ‚ÄúIt is very satisfying to see a successful multi-center trial that shows gene therapy can be dramatically efficacious.‚Äù

Primarily, the study sought to determine the safety of the gene therapy and its varying dosage levels. Researchers did find some patients had side effects, but the overwhelming majority were related to the surgical procedure itself. The most common side effect was conjunctival hemorrhage, the breakage of small blood vessels underneath the clear surface of the eye, which healed. Two patients had eye inflammation that was reversed with a course of steroids. No serious side effects were related to the study drug.

This work comes on the heels of another successful ophthalmological trial at Penn restoring sight in patients with a different form of LCA. Earlier in 2024, [CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing was used](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2024/may/gene-editing-improves-sight-in-children-treated-for-blindness) to improve the sight of many patients with a form of LCA tied to mutations in the CEP290 gene. Co-led by one of the new paper‚Äôs co-authors, [Tomas S. Aleman, MD](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p11260), the Irene Heinz-Given and John LaPorte Research Professor in Ophthalmology and co-director with Cideciyan of the Center for Hereditary Retinal Degenerations, the study used similar tests and was the first time children were involved in any gene editing work.

‚ÄúThe treatment success in our most recent clinical trials together with our earlier experience brings hope for a viable treatment for about 20 percent of infantile blindness caused by inherited retinal degenerations,‚Äù Aleman said. ‚ÄúThe focus now is on perfecting the treatments and treating earlier manifestations of these conditions once safety is confirmed. We hope similar approaches will lead to equally positive outcomes in other forms of congenital retinal blindness.‚Äù

Moving forward, approval of this experimental medicine for clinical use requires another trial, where participants are randomized to a treatment dose and both patients and those investigating the trial not knowing who gets what. Through that, any possible bias in results could be avoided.

======================================================================================================

_Unlocking the potential of renewable Œ≤ cells and precision gene editing, researchers aim to revolutionize diabetes care and bring us closer to a functional cure for type 1 diabetes._

In a recent study published in the journal _Nature Reviews Endocrinology_, researchers examined the progress in cell replacement therapies for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), focusing on generating replenishable Œ≤ cells, improving transplantation methods, and addressing challenges related to immune modulation and clinical application.

Background
----------

T1DM affects 8.75 million people globally, approximately 1.52 million patients under 20. T1DM results from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic Œ≤ cells, consequent insulin insufficiency, and chronic hyperglycemia. Although glucose monitoring and insulin dosing help manage the disease, achieving optimal glycemic control remains challenging. Pancreatic islet or Œ≤ cell transplantation offers a potential cure but faces challenges such as limited donor availability, poor cell engraftment, and the need for lifelong immunosuppression. Current research focuses on improving cell delivery, finding alternative cell sources, and reducing reliance on immunosuppression. In the present review, researchers discussed the current advancements in cell transplantation for T1DM, focusing on Œ≤ cell generation, delivery technologies, immune modulation, relevant animal models, and the clinical translation of these therapies.

Renewable islet cell sources
----------------------------

The limited availability of donor islets has driven the development of stem cell-derived islets as a renewable source for T1DM therapy. These islets, generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), show promise in clinical trials but remain challenged by functional immaturity, transcriptional identity issues, and the inability to control the ratio of Œ≤, Œ±, and Œ¥ cells. During in vitro differentiation, a significant number of cells may acquire an unwanted identity, resembling serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells, which complicates their application in T1DM therapy. While _in vivo_ transplantation can enhance the function of these cells, optimizing in vitro production processes and ensuring safety, particularly concerning uncommitted cell types that could form tumors and ensuring genetic stability, remains crucial. Advances in scalable manufacturing, characterization protocols, and cryopreservation will be essential for the clinical adoption and accessibility of these therapies.

Cell delivery strategies
------------------------

Pancreatic islet transplantation for T1DM involves strategies like microencapsulation and macroencapsulation to protect islet cells and enhance their function. Microencapsulation encloses cells in gel-like microspheres, allowing nutrient exchange while shielding them from immune attacks. However, challenges like inflammation and fibrotic overgrowth affect long-term viability. Macroencapsulation delivers larger cell doses in retrievable units but faces issues with oxygen supply and fibrosis. Open devices and scaffolds aim for direct vascularization of grafts to improve integration and function, using approaches like simultaneous implant-transplant methods, decellularized tissue scaffolds, and 3D-printed architectures. Prevascularization systems are also explored to establish a vascular network before cell transplantation, improving cell survival and reducing immune responses. Despite these innovations, ensuring adequate mass transfer of oxygen, glucose, and insulin within encapsulation devices and managing graft size and immune protection remain significant hurdles. While these approaches show promise, challenges remain in achieving long-term efficacy, minimizing immune rejection, and optimizing oxygen and nutrient delivery to transplanted cells.

Alternative immunoprotection methods
------------------------------------

Œ≤ cell replacement faces challenges distinct from non-autoimmune diseases, mainly due to the need to prevent autoimmunity recurrence. Current immunosuppressive therapies are effective but have severe side effects, including organ toxicity and increased infection risks. Emerging strategies focus on more targeted, less toxic immunomodulation. These include biomaterial-based localized drug delivery, islet co-delivery with immunomodulatory cells, and reducing islet graft immunogenicity through advanced gene editing techniques. Biomaterials can deliver immunomodulatory drugs directly to the transplant site, while co-delivery with cells like mesenchymal stem cells improves islet survival. Gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR‚ÄìCas9, are being utilized to engineer hypoimmune islet grafts by knocking down immunogenic markers or overexpressing protective signals. However, the long-term impact of these genetic modifications remains uncertain, and safety concerns persist regarding the potential for immune evasion by these modified cells.

Animal models
-------------

Animal models support the development of cell transplantation strategies and immunomodulatory interventions. Immunocompromised models, mainly using mice, allow for studying human islet engraftment without rejection. In contrast, immunocompetent models, such as rats, pigs, and non-human primates (NHPs), better mimic human immune responses critical for evaluating inflammatory and immune protection strategies. Humanized models, incorporating human immune components, provide a unique platform to assess the immunogenicity of Œ≤ cell grafts and therapeutic interventions despite limitations such as graft-versus-host disease and shorter experimental timeframes. Pigs provide insights into islet transplantation due to their physiological similarities to humans, while NHPs serve as valuable translational models, contributing to understanding immune responses and developing new immunosuppressive strategies. Together, these models facilitate comprehensive assessments of therapeutic interventions for T1DM.

Clinical translation
--------------------

Harmonizing preclinical testing protocols is vital for Œ≤ cell replacement therapy development. Characterization of stem cell-derived Œ≤ cells should include composition and functional assessments. Initial rodent studies must evaluate cell delivery and immune responses, with further validation in larger animal models. Development of a Œ≤ cell replacement product involves renewable cell sources, effective delivery, and immune rejection prevention. The goal is to create a safe, reproducible product that restores glycemic control for over ten years without systemic immunosuppression.

Conclusion and outlook
----------------------

In conclusion, cell transplantation for T1DM has evolved significantly, with stem cell-derived islets showing promise for clinical application. However, challenges related to cell composition, functional maturity, and long-term safety continue to be critical areas of focus. Collaborative consortia are accelerating progress by integrating complementary technologies. Innovations in renewable Œ≤ cell sources, gene editing technology, and subcutaneous transplantation methods aim to improve cell delivery, immune modulation, and patient outcomes. The goal is to develop a widely applicable, practical, and accessible treatment that improves the quality of life for T1DM patients.

- **Study Overview**: A cohort study involving over 298,000 adults in Sweden and Denmark examined the relationship between glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and suicide death risk among patients treated for type 2 diabetes. 
- **Reassuring Findings**: The study revealed no significant increase in the risk of suicide death among users of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to those on SGLT2 inhibitors. The overall incidence rates were notably low: 0.23 vs. 0.18 per 1000 person-years.  
- **No Elevated Risk**: With an HR of 1.25 (95% CI, 0.83-1.88) for suicide death, the conclusion was clear: despite concerns, the initiation of GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment doesn't seem to elevate suicide risk. However, the potential for small risk increases cannot be entirely dismissed. 
- **Other Observations**: Interestingly, there was a slight reduction in self-harm incidents (HR 0.83), and no association with new diagnoses of depression or anxiety (HR 1.01).
- **Context Matters**: Given that GLP-1s are increasingly prescribed for obesity, consider that this study primarily focused on diabetes patients. Discussions about potential risks in broader applications are still warranted.

Key Points

**Question** What is the association between use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and risk of suicide death in patients treated in routine clinical practice?

**Findings** In this cohort study of 298‚ÄØ553 adults initiating a GLP-1 receptor agonist or a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor nationwide in Sweden and Denmark, the incidence rate of suicide death was low, and those initiating GLP-1 receptor agonist use did not experience increased risk.

**Meaning** This study provides reassuring data showing that those initiating GLP-1 receptor agonist use were not at increased risk of suicide death, although the study could not assess small risk increases.

**Importance** Concerns have been raised regarding a link between use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and increased risk of suicidality and self-harm.

**Objective** To assess the association between use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and the risk of suicide death in routine clinical practice.

**Design, Setting, and Participants** This active-comparator new-user cohort study used nationwide register data from Sweden and Denmark from 2013 to 2021. Adults 18 to 84 years old who initiated treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists or the comparator sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were included. Data were analyzed from March to June 2024.

**Exposure** Initiation of treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor.

**Main Outcomes and Measures** The primary outcome was suicide death recorded in the cause of death registers. Secondary outcomes were the composite of suicide death and nonfatal self-harm and the composite of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. Using propensity score weighting, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated separately in the 2 countries and pooled in a meta-analysis.

**Results** In total, 124‚ÄØ517 adults initiated a GLP-1 receptor agonist and 174‚ÄØ036 initiated an SGLT2 inhibitor; among GLP-1 receptor agonist users, the mean (SD) age was 60 (13) years, and 45% were women. During a mean (SD) follow-up of 2.5 (1.7) years, 77 suicide deaths occurred among users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 71 suicide deaths occurred among users of SGLT2 inhibitors: weighted incidences were 0.23 vs 0.18 events per 1000 person-years (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.83-1.88), with an absolute difference of 0.05 (95% CI, ‚àí0.03 to 0.16) events per 1000 person-years. The HR was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.97) for suicide death and nonfatal self-harm, and the HR was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.97-1.06) for incident depression and anxiety-related disorders.

**Conclusions and Relevance** This cohort study, including mostly patients with type 2 diabetes, does not show an association between use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and an increased risk of suicide death, self-harm, or incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. Suicide death among GLP-1 receptor agonist users was rare, and the upper limit of the confidence interval was compatible with an absolute risk increase of no more than 0.16 events per 1000 person-years.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are increasingly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Concerns have been raised regarding suicidality and self-harm linked to use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. In July 2023, the European Medicines Agency launched an investigation into the safety signal following around 150 spontaneous reports received by the agency regarding suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm potentially associated with the drug. An effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on suicidality is plausible, as GLP-1 receptors are present in the central nervous system and GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. Previous studies have linked bariatric surgery and weight-reduction drugs to a potentially increased risk of suicide and self-harm. Conversely, it has also been suggested that GLP-1 receptor agonists may protect against depression. This hypothesis is based on studies indicating that depression and type 2 diabetes may have partly overlapping causes, including neuroinflammation, and that GLP-1 receptor agonists show neuroprotective properties.

We conducted a cohort study using nationwide data from Sweden and Denmark to examine the association of GLP-1 receptor agonist use with suicide death. In secondary analyses, we assessed the association of GLP-1 receptor agonist use with the composite of suicide and nonfatal self-harm, as well as the composite of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders.

We used health and administrative registers in Sweden and Denmark, including the population registers, prescription drug registers, national patient registers, and cause of death registers, all with nationwide coverage in each country. The registers provide data on demographic variables and vital status, all filled prescriptions from all pharmacies in each country, diagnoses and procedures registered during all outpatient specialist care visits and hospitalizations, and causes of death. Sweden and Denmark have similar universal health care systems and register infrastructure. Using the same study protocol, we conducted the analyses in Sweden and Denmark separately and performed a meta-analysis of the 2 country-specific estimates.

The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. Informed consent was not needed. Ethical approval is not required for register-based research in Denmark. The study is reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines for cohort studies.

Using an active-comparator new-user design, we included all new users of either GLP-1 receptor agonists or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (comparator) who were 18 to 84 years old during 2013 to 2021. Patients entered the cohort at the time of their first filled prescription for either a GLP-1 receptor agonist or an SGLT2 inhibitor during the study period. SGLT2 inhibitors were used as the comparator because this drug has no known association with suicide death and was used in similar clinical situations (predominantly as second-line or third-line glucose-lowering drugs for treatment of type 2 diabetes) during the study period, with both GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors being recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Both drugs were primarily used for type 2 diabetes during the study period.

New use was defined as initiation of either drug among patients with no previous use of either drug at any time prior to cohort entry. Exclusion criteria were end-stage illness (severe malnutrition, cachexia, dementia, coma), history of dialysis, kidney transplant, major pancreatic disease, use of preparation of liraglutide with obesity indication before cohort entry (the comparator, SGLT2 inhibitors, are not used for this indication; liraglutide with obesity indication was defined using specific product codes), and no health care contact in the past year (to ensure a minimum level of health care contact and registration of health data), defined as neither outpatient care contact, hospital admission, nor use of any prescription drug.

The primary outcome was suicide death (primary or contributing cause of death), including both confirmed suicides and self-inflicted deaths of undetermined intent. Secondary outcomes were a composite of suicide death and nonfatal self-harm recorded as a physician-assigned diagnosis during hospitalizations or outpatient hospital visits. Self-harm was also analyzed as a separate outcome. Although nonfatal self-harm is known to be underreported in Denmark, we used this outcome also in Denmark because underreporting was unlikely to differ between the study drugs, thus allowing for calculation of relative risk estimates. For the analyses of outcomes including self-harm, we excluded patients with self-harm within 3 months prior to cohort entry.

Another secondary outcome was a composite of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders, recorded as diagnoses during hospitalizations or outpatient visits, or filled prescriptions for antidepressants. For this analysis, we further excluded patients with previous psychiatric disorders, defined as any psychiatric disease diagnosis or use of psychiatric medications at any time prior to cohort entry.

Patients were considered as exposed to the drug that they initiated at cohort entry until end of follow-up and were followed to outcome event, emigration, 5 years of follow-up, or end of study period (December 31, 2021). In each country separately, we estimated a propensity score for the probability of GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment conditional on variables at cohort entry, covering sociodemographic characteristics, calendar year of cohort entry, and medical history, including psychiatric diagnoses, recent health care contacts for psychiatric conditions, and prescription drug use. We controlled for confounding using the propensity score and standardized mortality ratio weighting to estimate the average treatment effect among the treated, as this can directly inform clinical decision-making. After exclusion of patients outside of the common range of the propensity score for the 2 groups, and those at the 1% tails of the distribution of the common range (trimming), the propensity score was reestimated, and those outside of the common range of the new propensity score were excluded. Reestimation of the propensity score after trimming is important because the model derived from the untrimmed population is mis-specified in the population that remains after trimming. Standardized differences below 10% after weighting were considered as good balance between exposure groups. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox regression, with days since cohort entry as the time scale. We performed a meta-analysis of the country-specific estimates, with a fixed-effect model using the method of Mantel and Haenszel. The absolute risk difference for the primary outcome was calculated as HR‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ1 multiplied by the rate in the comparator group.

We performed a subgroup analysis for the primary outcome by history of psychiatric disorders, as the investigated safety signal is of most importance for treatment decisions among those at high risk. We also performed subgroup analyses for those who initiated liraglutide and semaglutide, respectively. Propensity scores were reestimated for each secondary outcome and subgroup analysis.

We performed additional analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes. We applied an as-treated exposure definition, in which patients were censored at switch-to or add-on treatment with the other study drug or treatment discontinuation. Treatment duration was estimated based on the number of days covered by the filled prescriptions plus a 90-day period between prescriptions and after the last prescription. Furthermore, we restricted the follow-up to 1 year to assess whether a possible risk increase emerges shortly after treatment initiation.

Due to remaining imbalance in 1 baseline variable after weighting in Denmark (no use of other glucose-lowering drugs in the past 6 months), we adjusted for this variable in Denmark in post hoc sensitivity analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes. As the secondary outcome of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders included use of antidepressants, which can be prescribed also for other conditions, we performed a sensitivity analysis defining the outcome using only diagnoses registered during health care visits.

As the primary outcome analysis showed no statistically significant association, we calculated the E-value representing the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment and suicide death (conditional on the covariates included in the propensity score) to shift the confidence interval toward an increased risk such that it excludes the null. Confidence intervals not including 1.0 were considered as showing a statistically significant risk difference. Data were analyzed from March to June 2024, and analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

Population Characteristics

In total, 124‚ÄØ517 users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 174‚ÄØ036 users of SGLT2 inhibitors were included. Among GLP-1 receptor agonist users, the mean (SD) age was 60 (13) years and 45% were women. The most commonly used GLP-1 receptor agonists were liraglutide (50%) and semaglutide (41%). Patient characteristics before and after weighting for Sweden and Denmark separately are summarized in the tables. The propensity score distributions are shown in the figures. Patient characteristics were well balanced after weighting, except for the proportion of patients in Denmark with no use of other glucose-lowering drugs in the past 6 months. The median (IQR) follow-up time in the primary outcome analysis was 2.8 (1.2-4.8) years for GLP-1 receptor agonist users and 2.1 (0.8-3.6) years for SGLT2 inhibitor users in Sweden, and 2.1 (0.8-4.7) years for GLP-1 receptor agonist users and 2.2 (0.8-3.9) years for SGLT2 inhibitor users in Denmark. Combining the 2 countries, mean (SD) follow-up was 2.5 (1.7) years: 2.7 (2.3) years for GLP-1 receptor agonists and 2.3 (1.6) years for SGLT2 inhibitors.

During follow-up, 77 GLP-1 receptor agonist users and 71 SGLT2 inhibitor users died by suicide. The weighted incidence rate was 0.23 vs 0.18 events per 1000 person-years (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.83-1.88), with an absolute difference of 0.05 (95% CI, ‚àí0.03 to 0.16) events per 1000 person-years. The country-specific HR was 1.44 (95% CI, 0.87-2.37) for Sweden and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.46-1.91) for Denmark. In the subgroup analysis, the HR was 1.25 (95% CI, 0.77-2.02) for those with a history of psychiatric disorders and 1.44 (95% CI, 0.71-2.92) for those without such a history. The HR was 1.35 (95% CI, 0.85-2.15) for those initiating liraglutide and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.33-1.67) for those initiating semaglutide.

Secondary Outcome Analyses

After exclusion of those with nonfatal self-harm within 3 months prior to cohort entry, 124‚ÄØ459 users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 173‚ÄØ985 users of SGLT2 inhibitors were included in the analysis of self-harm. The HR was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.97) for the composite outcome of suicide death and nonfatal self-harm and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65-0.91) for self-harm.

After exclusion of those with previous psychiatric disorders, 72‚ÄØ420 users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 111‚ÄØ083 users of SGLT2 inhibitors were included in the analysis of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. The HR was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.97-1.06).

Results for Sweden and Denmark separately are summarized in the tables.

Additional Analyses and Sensitivity Analysis

In the analyses of suicide death, the HR was 1.27 (95% CI, 0.76-2.15) when using the as-treated exposure definition and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.54-2.28) when restricting the follow-up to the first year. The post hoc sensitivity analysis, in which the variable no use of other glucose-lowering drug in the past 6 months was adjusted for, yielded an HR consistent with that of the main analysis in Denmark. The additional analyses for the secondary outcomes and the sensitivity analysis in which the secondary outcome of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders was restricted to diagnoses registered during health care visits are summarized in the tables. The E-value for the primary analysis showed that an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both GLP-1 receptor agonist use and suicide death by a risk ratio of at least 1.7 to shift the confidence interval to exclude the null.

In this cohort study of nationwide data from 2 countries, we found no statistically significant increased risk of suicide death for GLP-1 receptor agonists vs SGLT2 inhibitors used predominantly for type 2 diabetes. The upper limit of the confidence interval was compatible with up to an 88% relative-risk increase of suicide death, which corresponded to an absolute risk increase of no more than 0.16 per 1000 person-years. The findings indicate that the absolute risks of suicide death in broad groups of patients using GLP-1 receptor agonists are low and any potential risk increase would be small. We also found a slightly lower risk of self-harm and no statistically significant association with incident depression and anxiety-related disorders.

The investigated safety concern for GLP-1 receptor agonist use was based on spontaneous reports of suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm. To cover a wider range of conditions and outcomes associated with thoughts of self-harm and suicide, we assessed suicide death, suicide death and nonfatal self-harm, and self-harm and incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. In randomized clinical trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists, increases in suicidality, depression, anxiety, and other adverse mental health outcomes have not been observed. However, many trials excluded those at highest risk of suicidality through exclusion criteria or based on investigators‚Äô judgment such that uncertainty remained regarding the generalizability of the findings to broader patient groups, and the statistical power was low due to few events. For example, a meta-analysis of clinical trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists included only 18 events of suicidal behavior among exposed patients.

A previous study using electronic health records from the TriNetX Analytics Network assessed diagnoses of suicidal ideation during 6 months after treatment initiation with the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide. In separate analyses, the study included 52‚ÄØ783 patients with overweight or obesity and 27‚ÄØ282 patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed semaglutide, then propensity score matched them with users of non‚ÄìGLP-1 receptor agonist antiobesity or glucose-lowering medications. Semaglutide use was associated with very large relative reductions in suicidal ideation diagnosis of around 70% in both sets of analyses, indicating that the study design likely introduced important biases. For example, immortal time bias may have been introduced as a new-user design was not used: patients with semaglutide prescriptions were first included regardless of their comparator drug use history, and the comparator group was selected from the remaining patients prescribed the comparator drug. Moreover, in the analyses of patients with type 2 diabetes, any other glucose-lowering drugs, including those used as first-line therapies, were included as the comparator, although this may have led to time-lag bias through misalignment in disease progression between the groups. Furthermore, suicide death during follow-up could not be accounted for as data on vital status and causes of death were not available.

Strengths and Limitations

This study expands the knowledge regarding the safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists by providing data about the risk of suicide death associated with use of the drugs using an active-comparator new-user design, which avoids time-related biases and aligns patients in the exposed vs control group with respect to disease stage. Moreover, confounders were adjusted for using a propensity score, including a wide range of patient characteristics, and the nationwide registers enabled analysis of national study populations with virtually complete data on cause of death. This study supports the conclusions of the European Medicines Agency‚Äôs investigation and the US Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs preliminary evaluation that the available evidence does not support a causal association between use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and suicidal and self-injurious thoughts and actions.

This study has limitations. We adjusted for potential confounders, including psychiatric disorders and socioeconomic status recorded in the registers, but unmeasured confounding may have affected the results. During the study period, GLP-1 receptor agonists were predominantly used for treatment of type 2 diabetes. The drugs are increasingly used also in patients with obesity who do not have diabetes, and the study findings might not be generalizable to this group of patients. Although it is possible that some patients included in the study used GLP-1 receptor agonists off label for weight reduction, this proportion is likely to be low; a Danish study showed that the proportion of new users of semaglutide with no evidence of a type 2 diabetes diagnosis in the register data was 1% to 5% in 2018 to 2020 and 15% in 2021. Moreover, in the present analyses, liraglutide (50%) and semaglutide (41%) were the most used GLP-1 receptor agonists; the subgroup analyses for each of the 2 GLP-1 receptor agonists had low numbers of events, and associations with suicidality could differ between individual drugs. Furthermore, mean follow-up time for GLP-1 receptor agonist users was 2.7 years, and although 25% of the GLP-1 receptor agonist users were followed for at least 4.7 years, risks may emerge with longer-term use. Although subgroup analyses with low numbers of events should be interpreted with much caution, especially when the subgroup hypothesis was not formulated a priori based on a suggested mechanism, the HR for suicide death in Sweden was 1.44 (95% CI, 0.87-2.37), with this nominal risk difference emerging around 3 years after cohort entry.

Some suicide deaths could also be misclassified. In an assessment of the reliability of the cause of death register from 2008, the proportion of suicide deaths with intent confirmed by experts was 81% in Sweden and 90% in Denmark, with few accidents and natural deaths being reclassified as suicides. We also included self-inflicted deaths of undetermined intent in the primary outcome definition, as an investigation by the National Center for Suicide Research and Prevention in Sweden showed that 20% of suicide cases in the country were coded as of undetermined intent and 70% to 75% of self-inflicted deaths with unknown intent were reclassified as suicide after further investigation. The overall rates of suicide death in the study population were largely in line with national estimates in both Denmark and Sweden. Nonfatal self-harm is known to be underreported in Denmark, and the absolute risks of the secondary outcome analysis, including this outcome, are likely underestimated, as is demonstrated by the substantially lower rates observed in Denmark compared to Sweden. We could also not assess suicidal thoughts and self-harm that did not result in suicide death or a registered diagnosis during contact with the health care system. The low risk of suicide death meant that the study had limited power to assess smaller risk increases.

In this binational cohort study including predominantly patients with type 2 diabetes, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared with SGLT2 inhibitors was not associated with an increased risk of suicide death, self-harm, or incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. While reassuring, the study could not rule out smaller absolute risk differences for suicide death, and future studies with more outcome events should be performed as data accumulate.

Introduction

Cancer survivors face substantial economic hardships during and after oncologic care, compounding the physical and psychosocial implications of a cancer diagnosis and compromising treatment adherence, quality of life, and survival. Financial hardship has been the focus of policy initiatives addressing cost-sharing and insurance coverage to alleviate direct costs to patients. However, the role of community factors and structural barriers in the experience of financial hardship remains unknown. We hypothesized that adverse community-level social determinants of health may exacerbate financial hardship for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. For these reasons, we estimated the prevalence of financial hardship among cancer survivors across cancer types and investigated associations with individual- and community-level characteristics.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed the 2021 Health Information National Trends Survey‚ÄìSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (HINTS-SEER), which is sampled from 3 SEER registries. We included respondents of all ages, cancer types, and disease stages in the HINTS-SEER cohort. The primary outcome was patient-reported experience of cancer-related financial hardship (categorized as not at all, a little, some, or a lot). The primary exposure was the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). Covariates included age, sex, education level, income, insurance status, and SEER cancer stage; individual-level race and ethnicity were omitted because community-level race and ethnicity are factored into the SVI and considered a social construct. Survey-weighted estimates of financial hardship across cancer types and for the entire cohort were calculated. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression for financial hardship was performed adjusting for all independent variables. Odds ratios were calculated for covariates, and average marginal effects were calculated for SVI. Analyses were adjusted for sample weights and complex survey design. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata, version 18 (StataCorp LLC); statistical significance was defined as 2-tailed P < .05.

Because HINTS-SEER data are publicly available, deidentified, and approved by local SEER registries and Westat Institutional Review Boards, this study was exempt from assessment and informed consent by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. We followed the STROBE reporting guideline.

Results

We identified 1212 respondents representing more than 400‚ÄØ000 cancer survivors on weighted analysis. The median (IQR) age was 72 years (65-79 years) and the median (IQR) SVI score was 0.41 (0.27-0.68); 59.1% had completed college, 56.5% had an annual household income greater than $75‚ÄØ000, 70.5% had private or employer-based health insurance, and 67.8% had localized disease. When asked about experience of financial hardship, 56.4%, 22.1%, 15.0%, and 6.5% responded not at all, a little, some, and a lot, respectively, with variation by cancer type. Increasing SVI score (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.80 [95% CI, 1.00-3.21]), younger age (50-59 years; aOR, 3.66 [95% CI, 2.37-5.67]), lower income ($35‚ÄØ000-$74‚ÄØ999; aOR, 3.55 [95% CI, 1.94-6.48]), advanced SEER cancer stage (nonlocal; aOR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.47-2.51]), and federal health insurance (Medicare; aOR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.02-2.00]) were associated with higher odds of increased financial hardship. An increase in SVI of 0.01 conferred a lower probability of reporting no financial hardship and higher probability of reporting a little, some, or a lot of financial hardship (average marginal effects: ‚àí12.37 [95% CI, ‚àí24.58 to ‚àí0.15], 3.49 [95% CI, 0.04-7.02], 5.35 [95% CI, 0.12-10.57], and 3.53 [95% CI, ‚àí0.13-7.20], respectively).

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study, approximately 50% of cancer survivors experienced cancer-related financial hardship, with a disproportionate number of survivors who were younger, were Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries, were socioeconomically disadvantaged, and had advanced disease. Social vulnerability was independently associated with increasing levels of financial hardship, emphasizing the central role one‚Äôs community may play in cancer survivorship and the compounding financial detriments of residing in a socially vulnerable community.

Study limitations include a study design that precluded our ability to establish causality, selection bias and reduced generalizability due to sampling methodology, recall bias due to patient-reported variables, and unobserved confounding. Although policy efforts to curb the costs of cancer care are essential, acknowledging the role of community and structural barriers and identifying socially vulnerable populations for targeted interventions represent a potential strategy toward mitigating financial hardship and delivering equitable cancer care.

There will be no change in the quality or number of clinical summaries produced; in fact, online, primary care practitioners will have easy access to the whole catalogue of clinical summaries rather than the selection featured in the print handbook. Accessing _Guidelines_ online means that the latest summaries are available wherever and whenever needed.

In addition, online _Guidelines_ summaries feature useful signposts to related resources on the same guidance, such as _Guidelines in Practice_ articles or Primary Care Hacks. Finally, becoming exclusively digital is a more sustainable choice, saving paper, plastic, power, and transport.

### Building on the Successes of the _Guidelines_ Handbook 

For 27 years, the _Guidelines_ print handbook has delivered the latest clinical guideline summaries to GP surgeries around the UK. At its peak, the _Guidelines_ handbook was issued four times a year to an audience of 30,000 GPs, nurses, and clinical pharmacists working in UK primary care, delivering a selection of summaries of new, recently updated, and topical clinical guidance.

### _Guidelines_ in Numbers

The 2022/23 GP Media Survey, which examined the media preferences of 568 GPs, determined that:

*   clinical guidelines were the most valuable source of information to GPs
*   93% of GPs had sought clinical guidelines in the preceding 4 weeks.

In 2022, _Guidelines_ conducted a survey of the reading habits of 890 healthcare professionals, and found that:

*   78.3% used _Guidelines_ regularly to access clinical guidelines, second only to NICE
*   90% used _Guidelines_ to keep abreast of guidance updates
*   66% had changed or adapted their clinical practice as a result of reading _Guidelines_.

Since its inception, _Guidelines_ has met the needs of its audience by producing concise, easily navigable summaries of key clinical guidelines, highlighting the recommendations that have changed to help healthcare professionals working in primary care keep pace with guidance updates. Its editors and editorial advisory consultants have collaborated to produce accurate summaries of guidance by over 70 independent professional bodies, generating a catalogue of summaries across 29 clinical areas to support primary care with the implementation of best practice.

Some of the biggest successes in the history of _Guidelines_ include the creation at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic of the _Key COVID-19 guidance hub_‚Äîa one-stop repository of guidance, information, and resources on all aspects of COVID-19 for UK primary care practitioners trying to navigate the rapidly evolving situation. More recently, _Guidelines_ has benefited from working in partnership with NICE, enabling faster publication of summaries of new and updated guidelines.

_Guidelines_ will continue to innovate in 2025 and beyond, to support primary care in the delivery of best-practice care

TOPLINE:
--------

In a UK survey, participants said they supported the idea of weight screening and offers of weight management at dental appointments.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   A cross-sectional survey of 3463 adults from dental practices and community and hospital settings in England and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Be Part of Research initiative.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Most participants (85%) reported attending a dental checkup in the past 12 months, and 71.2% said they would like to lose weight.
*   Overall, 60% of participants said they would ""yes, definitely/probably"" be comfortable with their height and weight being measured to calculate their body mass index at a dental appointment, whereas 10.3% responded maybe and 28.6% said no.
*   In multivariable analysis, the odds of acceptance of weight screening at dental appointments increased with age (P = 0.004), male gender (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.66-2.36) and non-White race and ethnicity vs White (2.07; 1.42-3.03).
*   Majorities supported the dental team providing information on local weight management programmes (83.6%), having the dental team refer them to general practitioner offices/practice nurses (81.3%), and providing online resources or mobile applications (81).

IN PRACTICE:¬†
-------------

""The Making Every Contact Count initiative in the [United Kingdom] requires all healthcare professionals, including dental teams, to work collaboratively in supporting the public in using opportunistic interactions to support healthy lifestyle changes. Dental teams are suggested to be well placed to provide brief, tailored lifestyle interventions to the public,"" the authors wrote.

""Dental teams‚Ä¶must be supported by their indemnity providers and professional regulators for this to become part of routine practice. Contractual changes must reflect the need to prioritise and provide remuneration for prevention both for oral and general health. These changes would help provide assurances to dental teams that they were working within their scope of practice."" ""Equally important‚Ä¶is to empower the profession through training and establish clear protocols linking with other healthcare and weight management services,"" they added.

SOURCE:
-------

Conducted by Jessica F. Large, of the Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK, and colleagues, the study was published online August 20, 2024, in _Obesity_.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Limitations included weight was self-reported. Survey responders may not reflect the general public. Hypothetical scenario might not reflect the real-world experience.

- A recent study has highlighted a clear correlation between higher thiazide doses and significant reductions in urine calcium levels, which can ultimately lower the risk of symptomatic kidney stone events. 
- The research pointed out essential dosage classifications:
  - **Low:** Chlorthalidone < 12.5 mg/d, Hydrochlorothiazide < 25 mg/d  
  - **Medium:** Chlorthalidone 12.5 to < 25 mg/d, Hydrochlorothiazide 25 to < 50 mg/d  
  - **High:** Chlorthalidone ‚â• 25 mg/d, Hydrochlorothiazide ‚â• 50 mg/d  
- Key findings showed a notable reduction in urine calcium levels:
  - Low dose: 18.9% reduction  
  - Medium dose: 25.5% reduction  
  - High dose: 28.4% reduction  
- Across a follow-up period, the cumulative incidence of symptomatic stone events was significantly lower for higher thiazide doses, underscoring the potential benefits of tailored treatment.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

Higher thiazide doses are linked to greater reductions in urine calcium levels, which correlate with fewer symptomatic kidney stone events. This association suggests that adjusting thiazide dosage could be crucial in kidney stone prevention.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   The efficacy of using thiazides for kidney stone prevention was called into question by [the NOSTONE trial](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2209275), which found no added benefit of hydrochlorothiazide over a placebo in preventing kidney stone recurrence in high-risk patients.
*   Using the Medicare-Litholink Database, researchers identified adult participants with kidney stones prescribed thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, or indapamide) within 6 months after initial 24-hour urine collection and who underwent follow-up urine collections between 30 and 180 days after their first thiazide prescription fill.
*   Thiazide dosages were classified as:
    *   Low (chlorthalidone, < 12.5 mg/d; indapamide, < 0.6125 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, < 25 mg/d)
    *   Medium (chlorthalidone, 12.5 to < 25 mg/d; indapamide, 0.6125 to < 1.25 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, 25 to < 50 mg/d)
    *   High (chlorthalidone, ‚â• 25 mg/d; indapamide, ‚â• 1.25 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, ‚â• 50 mg/d)
*   Changes in calcium levels in response to low, medium, and high thiazide dosages were evaluated. These changes were correlated with the incidence of symptomatic stone events, identified by emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or surgeries for stones within 6-48 months after the initial prescription fill.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   Researchers included 634 adults with kidney stones (mean age, 67.6 years; 46.5% women).
*   Higher thiazide doses were associated with greater reductions in urine calcium levels, with a low dose resulting in an 18.9% reduction, a medium dose in a 25.5% reduction, and a high dose in a 28.4% reduction (_P_ = .02).
*   At 4 years, the adjusted cumulative incidence of symptomatic stone events was 28.8%, 19.5%, and 18.0% for a low, an intermediate, and a high tercile of change in urine calcium levels, respectively, after thiazide prescription (_P_ = .04 for trend).

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

Considering the study's findings, experts from the University of California, San Francisco, and other institutions wrote in [an accompanying editorial](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.28927) that ""clinicians need to first identify patients with hypercalciuria and then aggressively treat them with thiazide diuretics to yield the most benefit in reducing kidney stone recurrence,"" adding, ""However, most clinicians likely prefer to start at low dosages and then titrate the dosage based on adverse effects and efficacy.""

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

This study's limitations included the possibility of omitted variable bias and unmeasured differences between participants prescribed different dosages of thiazides. The sample consisted mostly of older adults, potentially limiting generalizability.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

This study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. The authors declared no conflicts of interests.

TOPLINE:
--------

In the first meta-analysis of its kind, Swiss researchers find that only 14% of men treated for testicular cancer develop infertility. This is very reassuring considering that the majority of cancer survivors, up to 77%, express interest in paternity after completing cancer treatment.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   A meta-analysis of 30 studies of fertility, with 13,718 men after unilateral testicular cancer. In all, 25 of the studies were from Europe, four were from Asia, and one was from the United States.
*   Studies were identified by a search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases (2000-2022).
*   Infertility, the primary outcome, was defined by azoospermia at least 12 months after oncological treatment, and failure to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of regular unprotected sexual intercourse and/or usage of cryosperm.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Treatment for testicular cancer included: active surveillance after unilateral orchidectomy (32.7%); radiotherapy (23.1%); standard- or low-dose chemotherapy (33.7%); and high-dose chemotherapy (1.4%).
*   In a quantitative synthesis of 23 of the 30 studies, the overall pooled infertility prevalence was 14% (95% CI, 9%-21%).
*   Azoospermia was observed in 8% (95% CI, 6%-12%).
*   In the subgroup analysis of patients with good prognosis who received standard therapy, infertility prevalence was only 4% (95% CI, 2%-10%).

IN PRACTICE:
------------

The authors concluded that ""Despite the low prevalence of infertility, it is still recommended to undergo sperm cryopreservation because of the uncertainty of the subsequent therapy and the lack of large longitudinal data on individual treatment effects.""

Abstract
--------

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults. In May 2023, two subunit RSV vaccines (Arexvy [GSK] and Abrysvo [Pfizer]) received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In June 2023, ACIP recommended that adults aged ‚â•60 years may receive a single dose of RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making. In support of development of this policy, our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of RSV vaccination in the general population in this age group. We used a decision-analytical model of RSV over a two-year timeframe using data from published literature, FDA documents, epidemiological databases, and manufacturer data. We tracked RSV-associated outpatient, emergency department, inpatient healthcare utilization, RSV-attributable deaths, quality-adjusted life-years lost (QALYs), and societal costs. The societal cost per QALY saved from RSV vaccination depended on age group and product: adults aged ‚â•60 years, $196,842 for GSK's vaccine and $176,557 for Pfizer's vaccine; adults ‚â•65 years, $162,138 for GSK and $146,543 for Pfizer; adults 60- <65 years, $385,829 for GSK and $331,486 for Pfizer. Vaccine efficacy, incidence of RSV hospitalization, and vaccine cost had the greatest influence on cost per QALY. Cost per QALY saved decreased as the age of those vaccinated increased. Inputs such as long-term efficacy are uncertain. RSV vaccination in adults aged ‚â•60 years may be cost-effective, particularly in those of more advanced age. Lower vaccine acquisition costs and persistent efficacy beyond two RSV seasons would render RSV vaccination more cost-effective for a broader target population.

Introduction
------------

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes seasonal epidemics of respiratory illness in the United States, resulting in an estimated 60,000‚Äì160,000 hospitalizations and 6000‚Äì10,000 deaths annually among adults aged ‚â•65 years. Incidence of hospitalization and the risk of severe outcomes increase with age. Annual RSV-attributable costs among adults aged ‚â•60 years are estimated to be 6.6 billion.

In May 2023, two vaccines, developed by GSK and Pfizer, were licensed for prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged 60 years and older by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In June 2023, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) voted to recommend that adults aged ‚â•60 years may receive a single dose of RSV vaccination, using shared clinical decision-making. Preliminary results from this economic model were considered by ACIP as part of the policy decision-making process.

With over 75 million US adults aged ‚â•60 years, careful assessment of the competing costs and benefits of RSV vaccination is essential; in particular, whether use of these vaccines could be cost-effective among all adults in whom they are licensed (‚â•60 years) or only in a more limited subset.

The primary objectives of this study were to estimate avertable RSV illnesses and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each of these two vaccines compared with no vaccination in U.S. older adults, focusing on vaccination of the general population in these age groups, as routine age-based recommendations are often preferred for their simplicity and ease of implementation. Specifically, two study questions were considered: (1) To what extent is RSV vaccination (single dose of the GSK or Pfizer product) cost effective in adults aged ‚â•65 years, and (2) To what extent is RSV vaccination (single dose of the GSK or Pfizer product) cost effective in adults aged 60 to <65 years? Secondary objectives were to assess the cost-effectiveness of RSV vaccination in additional age subgroups of interest and to estimate the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to avert specific outcomes. Results from these secondary analyses may inform shared clinical decision-making under the current recommendation.

Material and methods
--------------------

We created a decision-analytical model of RSV infection and disease burden, simulating the effects of single-dose RSV vaccination on adults aged ‚â• 60 years (Appendix Fig. 1). The age of general Medicare eligibility, ‚â•65 years, was chosen as a threshold of interest for the primary analysis (base case). Secondary analyses also examined: 60 to <65 and ‚â• 60 years (inclusive of 60 to <65 and ‚â• 65). This population was stratified into age groups 60 to <65, 65 to <70, 70 to <75, and ‚â• 75 years using

RSV cases averted and number needed to vaccinate
------------------------------------------------

We estimate a 20 % uptake among adults ‚â•65 years old with either GSK or Pfizer vaccine would reduce outpatient RSV illnesses by 10.2 %‚Äì11.1 % and hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths by 13.5 %‚Äì14.7 %. NNV to avert one hospitalization ranged between 364 and 395 for all adults ‚â•65 years-old. NNV decreased with increasing age of vaccinees: the NNV to avert one hospitalization was 244 for adults ‚â•75 years old.

Discussion
----------

RSV vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of RSV illness in older adults in the US and may be cost-effective. Specifically, we estimate that 20 % uptake of RSV vaccination among adults aged ‚â•65 years assuming two seasons duration of protection may reduce RSV-attributable outpatient visits by approximately 10 %, and hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths by nearly 15 %. With higher uptake, vaccination could avert more RSV-attributable outcomes.

Conclusions
-----------

We found that reducing RSV disease burden by vaccinating adults aged ‚â•65 years with a single dose of the first-ever licensed RSV vaccines may be considered cost-effective, particularly for the oldest age groups. Lower vaccine acquisition costs and efficacy that persists beyond two RSV seasons would render vaccination more cost-effective. Additional work is needed to evaluate cost effectiveness of RSV vaccination, including long-term safety surveillance, and evaluation in different risk-based
