- *AKI history doubles the risk of developing dementia,* drawing attention to the need for early monitoring.
- This study followed over 305,000 individuals aged 65+ in Stockholm, uncovering 47,938 cases of dementia over 12 years.
- Notably, AKI increased the occurrence of Lewy body dementia (DLB) by 88%, vascular dementia by 47%, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) by 31%. 
- Severe AKI linked to hospitalization poses a **61%** higher risk than less severe cases. 
- A dose-response relationship exists between the severity of AKI and dementia risk, reinforcing the need for comprehensive prevention strategies.  
- Age stratification revealed a staggering **four-fold increase in DLB and PDD risk** for those over 85 years.

These insights emphasize the importance of monitoring kidney function as part of dementia prevention strategies. Let's discuss how this can be integrated into clinical practice!

_Study:¬†[Acute Kidney Injury and Its Association With Dementia and Specific Dementia Types: Findings From a Population-Based Study in Sweden.](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209751) Image Credit: crystal light / Shutterstock.com_

A recent study published in the journal¬†_[Neurology](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209751)_ examines the association between dementia risk and a prior history of acute kidney injury (AKI).

AKI and dementia
----------------

Dementia is a condition in which cognitive function declines progressively, thereby impacting the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). In 2019, about 55 million people were estimated to be affected by dementia.

Dementia is an incurable and progressive condition that requires active and comprehensive prevention strategies to reduce the public health burden and costs associated with its management. Several factors increase the risk of developing dementia, some of which include lower educational status, traumatic brain injury, midlife hypertension or obesity, diabetes, drinking, smoking, depression and social isolation, air pollution, and physical inactivity.

Like dementia, AKI increases the risk of adverse health outcomes, including death due to the development of heart and renal failure.

Preclinical studies indicate that AKI increases dementia risk. This association may involve multiple mechanisms, such as cerebrovascular pathology, autonomic dysfunction, abnormally low neurotransmitter levels, and neuroinflammation.

About the study
---------------

The current study involved 305,122 people 65 years and older in Stockholm, Sweden, who did not have a dementia diagnosis at baseline and had recorded kidney function measures. After a diagnosis of AKI, the study participants were monitored for any dementia.

Dementia occurrence was stratified by AKI history, the severity of AKI, AKI recurrence, and whether their kidney injury was community- or hospital-acquired.

What did the study show?
------------------------

The median participant age was 75 years, 57% of whom were women. During the follow-up period of 12 years, 79,888 cases of AKI and 47,938 cases of dementia were reported.

About 36% of the study cohort was diagnosed with hypertension, whereas 11% and 10% were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation, respectively. About 30% and 25% of the individuals were prescribed beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi and ARB), respectively. About 20% of the study cohort had stages three to five chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The mean age when AKI occurred was 77 years. Hypertension was the most common illness in the AKI subgroup, with a higher prevalence of 69% as compared to 36% in the entire study cohort.

The most frequently prescribed drugs reported in the AKI subgroup included ACEi, ARBs, or beta-blockers. Over 64% of individuals with AKI were also diagnosed with CKD.

Doubled risk of dementia after AKI
----------------------------------

A total of 37 cases of dementia for every 1,000 person-years (PY) was reported among people with a history of AKI. Comparatively, before the AKI incident, the dementia incidence was 17.3 for every 1,000 PY.

After compensating for other confounding factors, the occurrence of AKI was associated with a 50% increased risk of developing any type of dementia as compared to those without a history of AKI.

An increased risk of dementia was associated with Lewy bodies (DLB)/Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) by 88%, 47%, and 31%, respectively.

Severe AKI that required hospitalization rather than outpatient management was associated with an increased dementia risk. The risk was 45% higher after AKI stage one as compared to 61% higher following stages two and three.

Hospital-acquired and hospital-managed AKI was also associated with a 55% higher dementia risk as compared to 31% for community-acquired/community-managed AKI. This risk was similarly increased at 48% and 39% for patients with two and three recurrences of AKI, respectively.

The impact of AKI on different types of dementia
------------------------------------------------

The risk of DLB and PDD was 88% higher in individuals with a history of AKI as compared to an increased risk of 47% and 31% for vascular dementia and AD, respectively. In general, specific dementia types were more common with recurrent AKI and increased AKI severity.

The most common type of dementia was AD, with a total of 17,663 cases from 47,938 dementia diagnoses. Vascular dementia, DLB, PDD, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) accounted for 29.7%, 3.6%, and 1% of dementia cases, respectively.

Age-stratified analyses identified a four-fold increased risk of DLB and PDD among those older than 85 years.

Conclusions
-----------

> _This study identifies individuals with AKI as a population at high risk of dementia who may benefit from close monitoring for early detection and implementation of antidementia strategies_.‚Äù

The study findings confirm previous studies reporting a two-fold risk of dementia among people hospitalized with AKI while also extending these observations to a broader patient sample over a longer duration. The researchers also identified a dose-response relationship between dementia risk and AKI history, thus supporting a causal association between these two diseases.

2024-09-03 06:53:00,2024-09-04 02:18:46,"üö® Exciting Update in Diabetes Monitoring! üö®

Recent research from Klick Labs published in _Scientific Reports_ reveals a significant link between blood glucose levels and voice pitch in individuals with Type 2 diabetes.

Key Takeaways:
- **Study Scope:** Analyzed voice frequency changes in 505 participants (non-diabetic, prediabetic, Type 2 diabetic) with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).
- **Findings:** A linear correlation was found; higher blood glucose levels lead to an increase in voice pitch frequency.
- **Implications:** This breakthrough could pave the way for non-invasive, voice-based glucose monitoring, making it as simple as speaking into a smartphone.
- **Future Research:** Highlights the necessity to expand research into vocal biomarkers for diabetes management and monitoring.

===================================================================================================

As part of its ongoing exploration of vocal biomarkers and the role they can play in enhancing health outcomes, Klick Labs published a new study in _Scientific Reports_ today ‚Äì confirming the link between blood glucose levels and voice pitch and opening the door to future advancements in non-invasive glucose monitoring for people living with Type 2 diabetes.

In ""_Linear Effects of Glucose Levels on Voice Fundamental Frequency in Type 2 diabetes and Individuals with Normoglycemia_,"" researchers investigated how blood glucose levels influence the frequency of the voice in 505 participants across three glycemic statuses ‚Äì non-diabetic, prediabetic, and Type-2 diabetic. Participants were fitted with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and recorded their voices multiple times daily for two weeks. The analysis revealed a linear relationship where an increase in CGM glucose levels corresponded to an increase in the fundamental frequency in the voice.

> By establishing a significant positive association between glucose levels and fundamental frequency, our study provides compelling justification for more research on using voice to predict and monitor glucose levels. Whereas current glucose monitoring methods are often invasive and inconvenient, voice-based glucose monitoring could be as easy as talking into a smartphone, which could change the game for the estimated 463 million people around the world living with Type 2 diabetes.""

> Jaycee Kaufman, lead author and scientist at Klick Labs

Klick Labs' latest research marks another step forward in its ongoing commitment to revolutionizing the detection and management of diabetes using voice tech and machine learning. Their October 2023 study in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health_ demonstrated that voice and AI can screen for Type 2 diabetes with high accuracy. Previously, their _""Screening for Impaired Glucose Homeostasis: A Novel Metric of Glycemic Control""_ research also appeared in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health_ (May 2023), and their _""Homeostasis as a proportional‚Äìintegral control system""_ study was published in _Nature Digital Medicine_ (May 2020).

=============== 

Moderna's RSV vaccine is the third approved for the treatment of people aged 60 and over.

The European Commission on Friday approved Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults‚Äîthe first time the bloc has authorised an mRNA shot against a disease other than COVID-19.

RSV is a highly contagious seasonal virus that can cause severe symptoms in infants and the elderly‚Äîone in 20 of whom contract it each year in Europe, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

In the European Union, Norway and United Kingdom, RSV leads to the hospitalization of around 158,000 adults each year, as well as some 213,000 children under five, according to ECDC data.

""Vaccination saves lives,"" the EU's commissioner for health and food safety, Stella Kyriakides, said in a statement announcing the approval of Moderna's mResvia vaccine.

""We are determined to ensure that everyone has access to the protection that they need against serious diseases.""

The authorization, which follows a similar step by the US Food and Drug Administration in May, is based on a positive assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in June.

The EMA approved the use of mResvia for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD), which is caused by RSV, in adults of 60 and older.

The EU had previously approved two vaccines for protecting against RSV, manufactured by Pfizer and GSK.

GSK and Pfizer's vaccines rely on traditional technology: introducing a pathogen component to the immune system to trigger a response.

In contrast, Moderna's vaccine utilizes cutting-edge messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, instructing the body to produce a unique protein that stimulates an immune response, teaching it to defend against the infection.

""This approval of the first mRNA vaccine against RSV clearly shows the importance of innovation when it comes to protecting the health of our citizens,"" Kyriakides said.

Stephane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive, said the commission's approval was ""an important milestone for public health and highlights Moderna's mRNA leadership.""

==========================================================================

With 1k new patients a month, the company has almost quadrupled its revenue in one year
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4 min read

UK-based healthtech Doccla has secured a ¬£35m Series B, led by European VC Lakestar, with new investors French VC Elaia and existing investors General Catalyst, Speedinvest and the investment leg of German media company Bertelsmann also participating.

Having almost quadrupled its annual revenue in 2023, it's planning its expansion in DACH and France, and says its German and French investors will help its international growth plans.

The startup, founded in 2019, makes ""virtual ward"" technology for healthcare providers. It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.

Doccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland‚Äôs Health Service Executive (HSE).

Doccla‚Äôs founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.

‚ÄúWith the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it‚Äôs a huge opportunity to scale,‚Äù says Ratz.

The virtual A&E

Sweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.

According to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.

Patients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.

So far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it‚Äôs adding 1k new patients every month.

‚ÄúOver time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,‚Äù Ratz says.

Partnering with pharma

Doccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).

‚ÄúWe have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,‚Äù Ratz says. ‚ÄúThis is because we are in very close contact with our patients.‚Äù

Doccla says it‚Äôs interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he‚Äôs seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.

With 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.

In one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.

‚ÄúWe can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits ‚Äî in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,‚Äù Ratz says.

Doccla has raised a total of ¬£52m to date.

In October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.",gpt-4o-mini

The round is made up of $80m in equity and $100m in debt ‚Äî and is tied to specific milestones. The fresh funding tops up the startup‚Äôs $130m Series C, raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.

It‚Äôs the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.

Caresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.

### AI for hospitals

Caresyntax says it wants to build the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals‚Äô surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.

The company‚Äôs platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.

While some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax‚Äôs platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.

‚ÄúEffectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,‚Äù they add.

If it does what it sets out to do, it‚Äôs a big opportunity.

Costs associated with operations account for 30% of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends 11% of GDP on health.

Founded in 2013 in Germany ‚Äî Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 ‚Äî its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company‚Äôs revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.

### The rise of smart surgery

The round comes on the back of a strong 18 months for startups developing tech for the operating theatre.

The meteoric rise of a new class of weight loss drugs over the past two years, known as GLP-1s, has seen a new name take the title of Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, helped a country dodge a recession and hit grocery sales in the US.

The valuations of the companies that make this so-called ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù class of drugs ‚Äî which includes Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and US rival Eli Lilly (maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) ‚Äî have soared as investors bet big on a medication projected by some to hit $150bn in sales by the early 2030s.

The potential of the market has not been lost on founders.

It‚Äôs a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù opportunity, says Kai Eberhardt, the founder and CEO of Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform which operates in the UK, France and Germany, alongside its home market. It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.

‚ÄúFor us [GLP-1 drugs] are already a strong growth driver,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.‚Äù

While treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva‚Äôs overall business ‚Äî Eberhardt says it‚Äôs growing total patient and revenue numbers by ‚Äúdouble digit‚Äù percentage points year-on-year ‚Äî the meds could become the startup‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest‚Äù growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.

### Riding the wave

Oviva‚Äôs not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity ‚Äî many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.

In the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart‚Äôs CEO, food sales have fallen as the one in eight adults in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, propping up Denmark‚Äôs GDP in the process.

All of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have convinced them to get out their chequebook: Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a ‚Ç¨10m Series A in August 2023 a year on from a ‚Ç¨3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised ‚Ç¨3.1m last summer.

Many startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn‚Äôt start life offering them ‚Äî largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.

UK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs health‚Äù brand, but has recently changed that. The company‚Äôs website uses images of men and women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.

Yazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.

Meurling tells Sifted it had hit ‚Ç¨14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It‚Äôs now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.

Other startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men‚Äôs sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.

‚Äú[GLP-1 meds] are a game changer,‚Äù says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be ‚Äústrange‚Äù if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn‚Äôt looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.

While GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the ‚Äúhype‚Äù surrounding the drug class has ‚Äúopened doors‚Äù for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler ‚Äî adding that the startup managed to raise its ‚Ç¨400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It‚Äôs now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it‚Äôll look to target US employers ‚Äî who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.

### Kinks in the supply chain

There are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector ‚Äî not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.

Some of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate‚Äôs $100m in 2021 and Form Health‚Äôs $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than ‚Ç¨10m in a single round.

Investors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics ‚Äî Manual was still selling past the deadline.

If a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.

‚ÄúAs there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.‚Äù

### Who‚Äôll stump up the cash?

There‚Äôs also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.

While Numan‚Äôs head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the ‚Äúsuccess of private sector companies offering GLP-1 [drugs] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS‚Äù, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won‚Äôt be enough to hit real scale.

‚ÄúUS investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts [selling to whole organisations like health insurers],‚Äù says Syhler. ‚ÄúThis means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care ‚Äî where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.‚Äù

In Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.

In the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.

Oviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS ‚Äî but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it‚Äôs in ‚Äúmature dialogues with several health systems‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,‚Äù says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that don‚Äôt always want to work with startups. Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.

Whether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen ‚Äî but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. ‚ÄúI've never been an investor in a company that‚Äôs got so much attention ‚Äî in a space that‚Äôs got so much attention,‚Äù says Arnardottir.",gpt-4o-mini

On Wednesday UK-based period tracking app Flo Health announced it had raised $200m ‚Äî pushing its valuation beyond $1bn and making it Europe‚Äôs first femtech unicorn.

It turned out to be a very buzzy story: as people were quick to point out online, Flo also became Europe‚Äôs first women‚Äôs health unicorn with an all-male founding team ‚Äî a detail which sparked a backlash online.

‚ÄúA company founded by men, led by men and funded by men became the first WOMEN'S health app to achieve unicorn status. If this doesn't show you everything that's wrong with the ecosystem, I don't know what will,‚Äù Anna-Sophie Hartvigsen, cofounder of investment learning app and community for women Female Invest, wrote in a viral LinkedIn post, citing stats on the lack of funding for female founders. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad that a femtech company is doing well,‚Äù she later added in the comments. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs bad that only men are able to succeed in this space.‚Äù

Some founders in the comments underneath Hartvigsen's post said that they‚Äôve struggled with fundraising as a woman; there was also a debate in a private WhatsApp group seen by Sifted about whether female founders should add a token male founder to their team in an effort to increase their chances of getting cheques. Someone in that group added that we won‚Äôt fix the trend of men funding men until there are more female investors.

But others didn‚Äôt see it that way.

‚ÄúThis achievement should actually be celebrated. As a women's health investor that has invested in 7+ women's health companies, we are yet to see any of them scale,‚Äù Deepali Nangia, a partner at Speedinvest, wrote in response to Hartvigsen‚Äôs LinkedIn post. ‚ÄúFlo's achievement is a very strong signal to the market that [direct to consumer] women's health is monetizable in Europe and that there is money to be made here; this is what investors need to see so more money flows into women's health companies. Not to say that the challenges faced by women in pitching are any less, but we must celebrate all wins that lead to more capital deployed into this sector,‚Äù she argued.

Nangia added that she wasn‚Äôt doubting there‚Äôs a problem, ‚Äúbut every win should not be turned around to a problem‚Ä¶ Many people have been working on solving for this problem, which includes many women of course but also men.‚Äù

Another commenter added: ‚ÄúIf anything, let this be a door for more investors to look closely at the female health industry and invest their money there? Could this be an example of men allies? If it had to be a company founded and led by men, well thank you very much for opening the door, now let the rest go through.‚Äù

Priya Oberoi, partner at women‚Äôs health-focused VC Goddess Gaia Ventures, added: ‚ÄúFlo reaching series C [unicorn] status with 60 mln active users is a win for #womenshealth - helping to close that 131 year gender health gap and getting products and services out there to improve the lives of women.‚Äù

""We firmly believe that women's health has been critically overlooked, undervalued and underfunded for far too long,"" Flo said in a statement to Sifted. ""Our sincere hope is that Flo‚Äôs funding will inspire more investors to recognise the immense potential in this space."" The company added: ""We're proud to say that more than half (56%) of Flo's employees are women, including our leadership team.""

It‚Äôs an important debate, and, readers, I‚Äôm curious to hear your thoughts: why aren‚Äôt there more female-founded femtech unicorns?

=====================================================

**TOPLINE:**
------------

Higher thiazide doses are linked to greater reductions in urine calcium levels, which correlate with fewer symptomatic kidney stone events. This association suggests that adjusting thiazide dosage could be crucial in kidney stone prevention.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   The efficacy of using thiazides for kidney stone prevention was called into question by [the NOSTONE trial](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2209275), which found no added benefit of hydrochlorothiazide over a placebo in preventing kidney stone recurrence in high-risk patients.
*   Using the Medicare-Litholink Database, researchers identified adult participants with kidney stones prescribed thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, or indapamide) within 6 months after initial 24-hour urine collection and who underwent follow-up urine collections between 30 and 180 days after their first thiazide prescription fill.
*   Thiazide dosages were classified as:
    *   Low (chlorthalidone, < 12.5 mg/d; indapamide, < 0.6125 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, < 25 mg/d)
    *   Medium (chlorthalidone, 12.5 to < 25 mg/d; indapamide, 0.6125 to < 1.25 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, 25 to < 50 mg/d)
    *   High (chlorthalidone, ‚â• 25 mg/d; indapamide, ‚â• 1.25 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, ‚â• 50 mg/d)
*   Changes in calcium levels in response to low, medium, and high thiazide dosages were evaluated. These changes were correlated with the incidence of symptomatic stone events, identified by emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or surgeries for stones within 6-48 months after the initial prescription fill.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   Researchers included 634 adults with kidney stones (mean age, 67.6 years; 46.5% women).
*   Higher thiazide doses were associated with greater reductions in urine calcium levels, with a low dose resulting in an 18.9% reduction, a medium dose in a 25.5% reduction, and a high dose in a 28.4% reduction (_P_ = .02).
*   At 4 years, the adjusted cumulative incidence of symptomatic stone events was 28.8%, 19.5%, and 18.0% for a low, an intermediate, and a high tercile of change in urine calcium levels, respectively, after thiazide prescription (_P_ = .04 for trend).

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

Considering the study's findings, experts from the University of California, San Francisco, and other institutions wrote in [an accompanying editorial](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.28927) that ""clinicians need to first identify patients with hypercalciuria and then aggressively treat them with thiazide diuretics to yield the most benefit in reducing kidney stone recurrence,"" adding, ""However, most clinicians likely prefer to start at low dosages and then titrate the dosage based on adverse effects and efficacy.""

**SOURCE:**

It was published [online](https://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.28953&utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2024.28953) in _JAMA Network Open_.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

This study's limitations included the possibility of omitted variable bias and unmeasured differences between participants prescribed different dosages of thiazides. The sample consisted mostly of older adults, potentially limiting generalizability.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

This study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. The authors declared no conflicts of interests.

===============

This site is intended for UK healthcare professionals

TOPLINE:
--------

In the first meta-analysis of its kind, Swiss researchers find that only 14% of men treated for testicular cancer develop infertility. This is very reassuring considering that the majority of cancer survivors, up to 77%, express interest in paternity after completing cancer treatment.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

* A meta-analysis of 30 studies of fertility, with 13,718 men after unilateral testicular cancer. In all, 25 of the studies were from Europe, four were from Asia, and one was from the United States.
* Studies were identified by a search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases (2000-2022).
* Infertility, the primary outcome, was defined by azoospermia at least 12 months after oncological treatment, and failure to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of regular unprotected sexual intercourse and/or usage of cryosperm.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

* Treatment for testicular cancer included: active surveillance after unilateral orchidectomy (32.7%); radiotherapy (23.1%); standard- or low-dose chemotherapy (33.7%); and high-dose chemotherapy (1.4%).
* In a quantitative synthesis of 23 of the 30 studies, the overall pooled infertility prevalence was 14% (95% CI, 9%-21%).
* Azoospermia was observed in 8% (95% CI, 6%-12%).
* In the subgroup analysis of patients with good prognosis who received standard therapy, infertility prevalence was only 4% (95% CI, 2%-10%).

IN PRACTICE:
------------

The authors concluded that ""Despite the low prevalence of infertility, it is still recommended to undergo sperm cryopreservation because of the uncertainty of the subsequent therapy and the lack of large longitudinal data on individual treatment effects.""

SOURCE:
-------

The lead and corresponding author is Janna Pape of the University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. The study appeared in _Andrology_.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Limitations included an observational data and a high heterogeneity across studies.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

None of the authors reported competing interests. Funding for the study was from the Swiss Cancer League.

**Key Points**

**Question**  
Is œâ-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA; ie, fish oil) supplementation during pregnancy associated with reduced risk of childhood atopic dermatitis (AD) in mothers carrying specific cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) genotypes?

**Findings**  
In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial including 635 mother-child pairs with 10-year follow-up, a reduced risk of childhood AD until age 10 years was found only for mothers carrying the COX1 TT genotype who received n-3 LCPUFA supplements. There was increased AD risk among children of mothers with the CC genotype and no association overall or for mothers carrying the CT genotype.

**Meaning**  
The findings support use of a personalized prevention strategy for reducing the burden of childhood AD by genotyping expecting mothers in early pregnancy and providing n-3 LCPUFA supplementation only to women carrying the COX1 TT genotype.

**Abstract**

**Importance**  
Eicosanoids have a pathophysiological role in atopic dermatitis (AD), but it is unknown whether this is affected by prenatal œâ-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA; ie, fish oil) supplementation and genetic variations in the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) pathway.

**Objective**  
To explore the association of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy with risk of childhood AD overall and by maternal COX1 genotype.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  
This prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial included mother-child pairs from the Danish Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 birth cohort, with prospective follow-up until children were aged 10 years. In the trial, maternal and child COX1 genotypes were determined, and urinary eicosanoids were quantified when the child was 1 year of age. The present study was conducted from January 2019 to December 2021, and data were analyzed from January to September 2023.

**Intervention**  
A total of 736 pregnant women at 24 weeks‚Äô gestation were randomized 1:1 to 2.4 g of n-3 LCPUFA (fish oil) or placebo (olive oil) per day until 1 week post partum.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  
Risk of childhood AD until age 10 years overall and by maternal COX1 genotype.

**Results**  
At age 10 years, 635 children (91%; 363 [57%] female) completed the clinical follow-up, and these mother-child pairs were included in this study; 321 (51%) were in the intervention group and 314 (49%) in the control group. Pregnancy n-3 LCPUFA supplementation was associated with lower urinary thromboxane A2 metabolites at age 1 year (Œ≤, ‚Äì0.46; 95% CI, ‚Äì0.80 to ‚Äì0.13; P = .006), which was also associated with COX1 rs1330344 genotype (Œ≤ per C allele, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.20-0.73; P = .001). Although neither n-3 LCPUFA supplementation (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.76-1.33; P = .97) nor maternal COX1 genotype (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.74-1.19; P = .60) was associated with risk of childhood AD until age 10 years, there was evidence of an interaction between these variables (P < .001 for interaction). Among mothers with the TT genotype, risk of AD was reduced in the n-3 LCPUFA group compared with the placebo group (390 mother-child pairs [61%]; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.98; P = .04); there was no association for mothers with the CT genotype (209 [33%]; HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.79-2.10; P = .31), and risk was increased among offspring of mothers with the CC genotype (37 [6%]; HR, 5.77; 95% CI, 1.63-20.47; P = .007). There was a significant interaction between n-3 LCPUFA supplementation and child COX1 genotype and development of AD (P = .002 for interaction).

**Conclusions and Relevance**  
In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, the association of prenatal n-3 LCPUFA supplementation with risk of childhood AD varied by maternal COX1 genotype. The findings could be used to inform a personalized prevention strategy of providing supplementation only to pregnant individuals with the TT genotype.

==================================================

Edited by Anushree Chaphalkar

September 02, 2024

**TOPLINE:**¬†
-------------

Compared with other urine analysis methods, urine Gram stain has a moderate predictive value for detecting gram-negative bacteria in urine culture but does not significantly improve urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis in the emergency department (ED).

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Researchers conducted an observational cohort study at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands, encompassing 1358 episodes across 1136 patients suspected of having a UTI.
*   The study included the following predefined subgroups: patients using urinary catheters and patients with leukopenia (< 4.0√ó10‚Åπ leucocytes/L). Urine dipstick nitrite, automated urinalysis, Gram stain, and urine cultures were performed on urine samples collected from patients presenting at the ED.
*   The sensitivity and specificity of Gram stain for ""many"" bacteria (quantified as > 15/high power field) were compared with those of urine dipstick nitrite and automated bacterial counting in urinalysis.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   The sensitivity and specificity of Gram stain for ""many"" bacteria were 51.3% and 91.0%, respectively, with an accuracy of 76.8%.
*   Gram stain showed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 84.7% for gram-negative rods in urine culture; however, the PPV was only 38.4% for gram-positive cocci.
*   In the catheter subgroup, the presence of monomorphic bacteria quantified as ""many"" had a higher PPV for diagnosing a UTI than the presence of polymorphic bacteria with the same quantification.
*   The overall performance of Gram stain in diagnosing a UTI in the ED was comparable to that of automated bacterial counting in urinalysis but better than that of urine dipstick nitrite.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""With the exception of a moderate prediction of gram-negative bacteria in the UC [urine culture], urine GS [Gram stain] does not improve UTI diagnosis at the ED compared to other urine parameters,"" the authors wrote.

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study was led by Stephanie J.M. Middelkoop, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands. It was [published online](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23744235.2024.2389478) on August 16, 2024, in *Infectious Diseases*.

**LIMITATIONS:**¬†
-----------------

The study's limitations included a small sample size within the leukopenia subgroup, which may have affected the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the potential influence of refrigeration of urine samples on bacterial growth could have affected the results. In this study, indwelling catheters were not replaced before urine sample collection, which may have affected the accuracy of UTI diagnosis in patients using catheters.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

No conflicts of interest were disclosed by the authors.

2024-09-02 02:59:00,2024-09-04 09:33:48,"In the evolving landscape of primary care, effective collaboration among healthcare teams is more crucial than ever. Here are some key takeaways for improving teamwork and communication:

- **Shared Objectives**: Establish a few meaningful goals that everyone is responsible for to foster trust and purpose.
- **Clear Roles**: Define roles and responsibilities clearly, and review them regularly to ensure efficient task completion.
- **Reflection & Feedback**: Regularly reflect on team dynamics, whether through meetings or casual check-ins, to maintain open communication and psychological safety.
- **Utilize Huddles**: Implement brief daily huddles to discuss tasks and patient specifics, promoting clarity and responsibility.
- **Leverage Technology**: Use digital tools for seamless access to patient records and enhance communication across care teams.
- **Physical Environment Matters**: Create shared workspaces to encourage real-time collaboration and integration among team members.
- **Supervision & Training**: Clinical supervision and ongoing training opportunities are essential for maintaining standards and supporting professional development.

As primary care continues to adapt, these strategies can help teams provide high-quality patient care while navigating the changes in their roles. Let's keep the conversation going on how best to support one another!

GPs‚Äô roles have changed enormously over the past few years. Having worked in the same practice for over 40 years, I perhaps see things from a different perspective, but I don‚Äôt think I am alone in this. I am a mentor to a few GPs in the national New to Practice Programme, and those I meet feel the same. The responsibility for making clinical decisions rests with GPs despite increasing involvement from other healthcare professionals. These practitioners have differing skill sets and lead on clinical areas that are rapidly changing; at present, these changes are not always shared with GPs. Better communication and understanding of any changes will enable more effective collaboration in primary care, facilitating provision of a quality service for patients‚Äîeven if the way primary care does this has changed.

### GPs as the Backstop 

One example of GPs charting unfamiliar territory when supporting the patients of another healthcare professional is evident in the management of diabetes. Many patients with diabetes are now managed by specialist diabetes nurses; however, when one of these patients has a problem and the nurse is unavailable, a GP is often asked to solve the problem. For significantly unwell patients, hospital admission is the best option, but for most queries, knowledge of current best practice in diabetes is needed. Fortunately, the regular general updates most GPs do with medical education providers such as NB Medical Education or Red Whale provide most of the answers.

Similarly, a pregnant patient may need medical advice the same day, but has been unable to contact the midwife team, so it falls to the GP. Some problems are not pregnancy related, such as respiratory infections. Others can present problems, such as aching calves with no abnormality found on examination. Testing the patient‚Äôs D-dimer level would not be helpful because it is raised in pregnancy anyway. Venous thromboembolism is more common in pregnant than nonpregnant women. GPs may feel unskilled, as midwife teams now look after most antenatal patients. Advice is on hand from the local obstetric unit‚Äîbut again, the clinician with the least experience is the first to be contacted.

### The Fundamentals of Effective Collaboration 

In well-developed practice teams, there is good communication, and complex problems are solved by adopting a multifaceted approach. So, how can primary care teams collaborate more effectively to achieve the best result?

Teams that work effectively together demonstrate a mixture of professional skills, mutual professional respect, and clear team communication. The King‚Äôs Fund has published a summary of how to achieve these elements of effective collaboration. The three main components are:

*   **a small number of meaningful objectives**‚Äîobjectives that team members are equally responsible for, to create a sense of shared purpose, trust, and collective achievement
*   **clear roles and responsibilities among team members**‚Äîoutlining what activities need to be done and by whom, to ensure that everything is completed and to clarify each member‚Äôs roles and strengths; this should be reviewed regularly
*   **reflection on how the team is working together**‚Äîthis can be in any form (for example, away days or team ‚Äòhuddles‚Äô), to cover both the technical aspects of work as well as how people are feeling; it is important that everyone feels safe to freely express themselves regardless of their role.

### Improving Communication and Teamwork 

Google‚Äôs 2-year research project into cultivating great teams found that the highest-performing teams had one thing in common‚Äîpsychological safety, or the belief that members can speak up or make mistakes without retribution. This is an important goal that primary care team leaders should aim for, as people become more creative, resilient, and motivated when they feel safe.

One way to improve communication is through huddles, which are short, frequent check-ins to discuss the day‚Äôs patients and tasks. Huddles can allow for the discussion of patient-specific issues and clarification of responsibilities.

Furthermore, digital communication tools, such as email and video conferencing, are also critical, as each team member will need access to shared patient records and booking systems to view and share information easily when needed‚Äîfor example, on home visits.

Finally, the physical environmental also plays a role in supporting new teams to function. Shared working spaces are the default location when team members are not seeing a patient, and these spaces have many benefits, such as improving integration and team cohesion, enabling real-time communication in huddles, and facilitating information sharing between team members. The King‚Äôs Fund highlights that team members are more likely to be sensitive to one another‚Äôs problems and appreciate each other‚Äôs roles when they have this sort of contact with each other.

### Ensuring Clinical Accountability and Supportive Management 

Clinical supervision, appraisals, and learning and development opportunities are essential to ensure that all team members are held to professional standards and encouraged to reflect on their own practice.

Clinical supervision and appraisals are essential requirements for all healthcare professionals. There are many effective models of clinical supervision, including one-to-one, group, or peer supervision. Clinical supervision should be developed by teams to meet their needs. Appraisals are a requirement in the NHS and should be focused on a shared understanding of team goals, two-way communication, and setting goals for the future. In addition, all team members need to have the skills, knowledge, and experience to deliver effective care. Identifying the needs of team members and ensuring access to training and opportunities to develop is critical for all healthcare professionals to maintain their registration and stay up to date with current practice.

The face of primary care is changing, and making sure that all team members stay on top of changes to their roles and responsibilities is important for fostering a harmonious and effective environment that encourages collaboration and enables provision of a superb service to patients. To those of you who are already doing all of this‚Äîwell done!",gpt-4o-mini

- **Approval Details**: Balversa (erdafitinib) can be used as a once-daily monotherapy for adults with FGFR3 alterations after prior therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor.
- **Evidence Backing**: The European approval is based on the phase 3 THOR study, showing Balversa reduced the risk of death by 36% vs. chemotherapy with a median survival of 12.1 months.
- **Treatment Pathways**: In contrast to the broader approval in the US allowing more second-line options, the EU label focuses on its use after immunotherapy.
- **Further Research**: Ongoing studies (THOR-2) are investigating Balversa in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and have shown promising preliminary results.
- **Sales Potential**: J&J anticipates this approval could propel sales beyond $1 billion, a significant milestone for bladder cancer therapeutics.

==============================================================

**Johnson & Johnson's Balversa has become the first drug approved in the EU to treat adults with advanced urothelial carcinoma (mUC) with FGFR3 genetic alterations after one line of prior therapy.**

The green light from the European Commission comes a few months after pan-FGFR inhibitor Balversa (erdafitinib) was cleared for the same indication in the US, with a different label than the drug had when it was granted an early, accelerated approval by the FDA in 2019.

As in the US, the EC has said that Balversa can be used as a once-daily monotherapy in patients previously treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, now a first-line therapy of choice of mUC, the most common form of bladder cancer.

Previously, the FDA cleared the drug for patients with FGFR2 alterations, and it could also be used for post-chemotherapy patients, regardless of whether they were eligible for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. The full US approval was wider in one respect, however, as it made Balversa an option broadly as a second-line therapy while it was previously only labelled for post-chemo use.

Bladder cancer saw few therapeutic advances for decades until the advent of checkpoint inhibitor therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, several of which are approved for either first- or second-line treatment of mUC.

The EU approval of Balversa is based on a subgroup of patients from the phase 3 THOR study, which compared the drug to chemotherapy in patients with advanced or mUC with FGFR alterations who had progressed on or after one or two prior treatments, at least one of which included an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drug.

In the Cohort 1 group, J&J's drug reduced the risk of death by 36% compared to chemo, with a median duration of survival of 12.1 months and 7.8 months, respectively. The study was also supposed to recruit FGFR2-altered mUC patients, but this is vanishingly rare and no subjects with that form were recruited into the trial.

A second subgroup (Cohort 2) compared Balversa to MSD's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in patients who had not previously been treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, but J&J's drug wasn't able to show an improvement in overall survival. As a result, the company is positioning its drug as an option for patients who still need treatment after immunotherapy.

J&J, meanwhile, is also testing Balversa in the THOR-2 study, which is comparing the drug to the investigator's choice of intravesical chemotherapy in patients with high-risk non‚Äìmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

Interim results reported at last year's ESMO congress revealed a 72% reduction in disease recurrence or death with erdafitinib, although tolerability was a problem, with a third of patients having to discontinue treatment with the drug.

Approval in that indication could help the drug achieve $1 billion-plus sales, according to J&J, although the drug still has a long way to go as sales are not high enough to be broken out in J&J's quarterly financial reporting.",gpt-4o-mini

Key Points 

**Question**  What are the prevalence, cardiac phenotypes, and outcomes of transthyretin gene (_TTR_) variants in the UK Biobank population?

**Findings**  In this cohort study of 469‚ÄØ789 UK Biobank participants, 0.1% were found to be carriers of likely pathogenic or pathogenic _TTR_ variants, which is higher than previously reported. Despite clinical codes suggesting low disease penetrance, cardiac expression of these genotypes was evident from associations with left ventricular mass, conduction disease, incident heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

**Meaning**  These findings emphasize the need for clinical vigilance in identifying individuals at risk of developing transthyretin amyloidosis and associated poor outcomes.

Abstract

**Importance**  The population prevalence of cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) caused by pathogenic variation in the _TTR_ gene (vATTR) is unknown.

**Objective**  To estimate the population prevalence of disease-causing _TTR_ variants and evaluate associated phenotypes and outcomes.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  This population-based cohort study analyzed UK Biobank (UKB) participants with whole-exome sequencing, electrocardiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance data. Participants were enrolled from 2006 to 2010, with a median follow-up of 12 (IQR, 11-13) years (cutoff date for the analysis, March 12, 2024). Sixty-two candidate _TTR_ variants were extracted based on rarity (minor allele frequency ‚â§0.0001) and/or previously described associations with amyloidosis if more frequent.

**Exposure**  Carrier status for _TTR_ variants.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  Associations of _TTR_ carrier status with vATTR prevalence and cardiovascular imaging and electrocardiogram traits were explored using descriptive statistics. Associations between _TTR_ carrier status and atrial fibrillation, conduction disease, heart failure, and all-cause mortality were evaluated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Genotypic and diagnostic concordance was examined using _International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision_ codes from the hospital record.

**Results**  The overall cohort included 469‚ÄØ789 UKB participants (mean [SD] age, 56.5 [8.1] years; 54.2% female and 45.8% male). A likely pathogenic/pathogenic (LP/P) _TTR_ variant was detected in 473 (0.1%) participants, with Val142Ile being the most prevalent (367 [77.6%]); 91 individuals (0.02%) were carriers of a variant of unknown significance. The overall prevalence of LP/P variants was 0.02% (105 of 444‚ÄØ243) in participants with European ancestry and 4.3% (321 of 7533) in participants with African ancestry. The LP/P variants were associated with higher left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.66; 95% CI, 1.87-7.44), and Val142Ile was associated with a longer PR interval (Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ18.34; 95% CI, 5.41-31.27). The LP/P carrier status was associated with a higher risk of heart failure (hazard ratio [HR], 2.68; 95% CI, 1.75-4.12) and conduction disease (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.25-2.83). Higher all-cause mortality risk was observed for non-Val142Ile LP/P variants (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.06-3.67). Thirteen participants (2.8%) with LP/P variants had diagnostic codes compatible with cardiac or neurologic amyloidosis. Variants of unknown significance were not associated with outcomes.

**Conclusions and Relevance**  This study found that approximately 1 in 1000 UKB participants were LP/P _TTR_ variant carriers, exceeding previously reported prevalence. The findings emphasize the need for clinical vigilance in identifying individuals at risk of developing vATTR and associated poor outcomes.

=================================================================================

NXP800 was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of ARID1a-deficient ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.

The novel GCN2 kinase activator NXP800 received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1a (ARID1a) ARID1a-deficient ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers, according to a news release from Nuvectis Pharma, Inc.

‚ÄúWe are very pleased to have received this designation from the FDA for NXP800. The prevalence of ovarian cancer, which is comprised of ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers, exceeds the 200,000-patient threshold below which drugs may be eligible to receive orphan drug designation in the United States,‚Äù Ron Bentsur, MBA, chairman and CEO of Nuvectis, stated in the news release.

The oral small-molecule inhibitor targets the HSF1 pathway, and it has shown strong anti-tumor effects in xenograft models of ARID1a-mutated ovarian carcinoma, as well as in other disease models.

Notably, the FDA granted fast track designation to NXP800 for patients with platinum-resistant, ARID1a-mutated ovarian carcinoma in December 2022, which was then followed by the initiation of the phase 1b clinical trial (NCT05226507) of NXP800 in platinum-resistant, ARID1a-mutated ovarian cancers in April 2023.

‚ÄúIn ovarian cancer it has been uncommon to receive this designation for the treatment of a subset of the disease. We therefore believe that this orphan drug designation granted by the FDA for NXP800 for the treatment of a subset of ovarian cancer, specifically for patients with an ARID1a deficiency, provides further validation for NXP800's mechanism of action and the target patient population in our ongoing phase 1b clinical trial in patients with platinum-resistant, ARID1a-mutated ovarian cancer,‚Äù Bentsur added in the news release.

At the 2024 SGO Annual Meeting on Women‚Äôs Cancer, investigators shared an overview of the ongoing study.

The ongoing phase 1b trial is enrolling patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer harboring ARID1A mutations, which is typically a tumor type that is mostly comprised of ovarian clear-cell carcinoma and ovarian endometrioid carcinoma. To be eligible for enrollment, patients must be 18 years of age or older, have measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, have experienced disease progression within 6 months from completion of platinum-based therapy, and must have received between 1 and 5 prior lines of systemic therapy, including at least 1 regimen containing bevacizumab (Avastin). Additionally, all patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and participants with a BRCA mutation must have received prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor.

Patients who did not respond to, or progressed during, or within 4 weeks of the last dose of first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy were excluded. Treatment with radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or an investigational agent within 28 days of the first dose of NXP800 was also not permitted, nor were active brain metastases.

The phase 1b portion of the trial is currently open for enrollment in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

Regarding the phase 1a portion of the study, which was the first-in-human clinical trial of NXP800, as of April 2023, a total of 18 patients have received at least one dose of NXP800, with the longest treatment duration reaching 10 months, and treatment is still ongoing for some participants. The investigation evaluated 2 different dosing schedules of the agent, including once daily (with total daily doses ranging from 50 mg to 150 mg) and twice daily (with total daily doses of 100 mg and 150 mg).

Furthermore, the most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported were vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, decreased appetite, and weight loss.

For the phase 1b study, doses of 50 mg and 75 mg per day were selected and were chosen based on preliminary population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic analyses, which indicated that once-daily oral administration of NXP800 at these levels achieved biologically active exposure while maintaining an acceptable safety and tolerability profile.

‚ÄúWe expect to provide a data update from this study this coming fall,‚Äù Bentsur concluded.",gpt-4o-mini

A study suggests transient elastography and fibrosis-4 index may be effective in predicting hepatocellular carcinoma risk in hepatitis C patients.

A new study found transient elastography and the fibrosis-4 index offer acceptable predictive performance for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with [hepatitis C virus (HCV)](https://www.hcplive.com/clinical/hepatitis-c) who have achieved a sustained viral response (SVR). 

‚ÄúThese findings highlight the substantial role of non-invasive surrogates in identifying patients at increased risk of HCC development after SVR, emphasizing their utility in clinical practice for guiding surveillance strategies after SVR,‚Äù wrote investigators, led by Han Ah Lee, from the department of internal medicine at Chung-Ang University Hospital, in Korea.

Even after achieving a sustained viral response following antiviral therapy for HCV, individuals with advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis may still develop hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, 8.2 ‚Äì 12.0% of people in South Korea and 34% of people in the US who have HCV develop liver cancer. To assess the predictive performance of transient elastography and the fibrosis-4 index in forecasting HCC development after SVR, investigators conducted a meta-analysis.

The investigators searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, selecting 27 studies for inclusion. Among these, 9 studies focused on transient elastography, 15 on the fibrosis-4 index, and 3 evaluated both methods.

Of the included studies, 11 were single-center, and 16 were multicenter. Most studies originated from Asia (n = 17), with the remaining from non-Asian regions (n = 10).

In total, the meta-analysis examined 169,911 participants with HCV who achieved SVR following antiviral therapy. The mean age of the participants was 54.1 years. The mean liver stiffness measured with transient elastography was 7.1 kPa and with fibrosis-4 index it was 1.86.

Investigators evaluated the predictive performances of transient elastography and fibrosis 4-index using the area under the curve (AUC). Before treatment, the pooled predictive AUC of transient elastography was 0.73, with a sensitivity of 65.7% and specificity of 69.5%.

The pooled risk ratio of pre-treatment transient elastography for HCC development after SVR was 3.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.21 ‚Äì 18.16). However, with a cut-off of 9.2 ‚Äì 13 kPa, the predictive performance improved, showing a pooled AUC of 0.79, sensitivity of 75.1%, and specificity of 71.7%. The pooled risk ratio at this cutoff was 4.56 (95% CI, 3.05‚Äì6.81).

For the fibrosis 4-index, the pre-treatment pooled predictive AUC was 0.72, with a sensitivity of 73.4% and a specificity of 60.5%. It has a pooled risk ratio of 2.30 (95% CI: 1.64‚Äì3.10) for hepatocellular carcinoma development after sustained viral response. With a cut-off of 3.35, the pooled predictive AUC was 0.73 and the pooled risk ratio was 2.45 (95% CI, 1.68 ‚Äì 3.13).

The team identified optimal cut-off values for predicting HCC after SVR: 12.6 kPa for transient elastography measured before treatment and 11.2 kPa for transient elastography measured after SVR.

‚ÄúThe identification of optimal cut-off values for TE and FIB-4 enhances the precision of risk stratification, enabling clinicians to tailor surveillance and management strategies more effectively,‚Äù investigators wrote. ‚ÄúThe study findings support the use of simple, specific cut-off values, thereby enhancing the clinical utility of TE and FIB-4 in HCC surveillance after achieving SVR.‚Äù

Investigators added that using cut-off values improves patient care and enhances the healthcare system more efficiently by focusing on patients most at risk.

Despite these findings, investigators said the results were limited by the reliance of retrospective studies, which introduces bias and limits causal inference, and significant heterogeneity in study design and patient characteristics, affecting the generalizability of findings. Additionally, the lack of standardized cut-off values and variability in follow-up duration complicate the applicability of the results, with further prospective studies needed to refine risk stratification and validate findings.

‚Äú‚Ä¶this systematic review and meta-analysis reinforces the importance of TE and FIB-4 in predicting the risk of HCC development after SVR in patients with HCV,‚Äù investigators wrote. ‚ÄúThese tools can guide the implementation of targeted surveillance strategies by identifying patients at an increased risk of HCC after SVR, ultimately facilitating the early detection and management of HCC. Future research for prospective validation of optimal cut-off values and the integration of non-invasive surrogates into clinical practice guidelines for HCC surveillance in patients with HCV who achieved SVR are needed.‚Äù

September 03, 2024

4 min read

Key takeaways:
* Time in range, time below range and glucose management indicator are three CGM metrics with limitations.
* Providers should consider HbA1c and CGM metrics while caring for a person with diabetes.

Both HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring metrics have limitations, and providers should not rely on a single metric for managing a patient‚Äôs diabetes, according to two speakers.

During a presentation at the Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists annual meeting, Viral N. Shah, MD, professor of medicine in the division of endocrinology and metabolism at Indiana University, and J. Daniel Ruck, DNP, BC-ADM, CDCES, doctor of nursing practice at Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, discussed how no single metric to assess glycemic control in diabetes is perfect. They recommended providers examine all data points they have for a patient and to consider each individual‚Äôs situation when managing diabetes.

‚ÄúWe are treating an individual with diabetes and not the numbers,‚Äù Shah told Healio. ‚ÄúHence, all different numbers, HbA1c and CGM metrics, should be taken together in account considering person-centric views and goals.‚Äù

Publication of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in 1993 established HbA1c as the gold standard for assessing risk for diabetes complications, according to Ruck. HbA1c has value in research, but Ruck said it is less useful for day-to-day diabetes management.

‚ÄúWhen we talk about on the ground what we can do tomorrow [for diabetes management], HbA1c is not as powerful,‚Äù Ruck said during the presentation. ‚ÄúMany factors can influence HbA1c measurements. If you have got a rare blood disease, that can affect it.‚Äù

Additionally, HbA1c does not provide information on hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia or the overall glucose profile of a person with diabetes, according to Ruck.

Time in range limitations

CGM can provide more data than an HbA1c measurement, but Shah noted that CGM data also have limitations. In a paper published in Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology in 2013, time in range was established as a glucose between 70 mg/dL and 180 mg/dL. Shah said 180 mg/dL was defined as the upper limit of time in range at the time because it was the postprandial glucose goal for most people with diabetes and there were no effective therapies to keep glucose within a target range of 70 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL.

‚ÄúWe define prediabetes by glucose on an oral glucose tolerance test of more than 140 mg/dL,‚Äù Shah said during the presentation. ‚ÄúSo 140 mg/dL has been accepted because it does increase the risk for cardiovascular disease independent of progression to diabetes. That limit of 140 mg/dL makes more sense to define the time in range, which now we are going to call time in right range.‚Äù

Shah said a time in range of 70 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL is a more physiological target for people with an HbA1c of less than 6.5%, those with prediabetes and people with type 2 diabetes using a GLP-1 receptor agonist or other noninsulin therapy. Ruck said providers should set time in range goals based on each individual‚Äôs situation.

‚ÄúHow safely we can target specific goals should be considered,‚Äù Ruck told Healio. ‚ÄúThe enemy of tight blood sugar control has always been low blood sugar, and if we can get people into tighter range without increasing their low blood sugar risk, then I see this as a good goal to pursue.‚Äù

Hypoglycemia, GMI limitations

Limitations also exist with time in hypoglycemia, or time below range. Time below range was defined as 70 mg/dL based on a 2005 report from an American Diabetes Association working group and was later accepted as the hypoglycemia cutoff by the FDA for artificial pancreas studies. Shah said the ADA working group decision was based off of hypoglycemic clamp studies done among people without diabetes and those with type 1 diabetes and generally did not include those with higher HbA1c measurements.

In 2016, a joint position statement from the ADA and European Association for the Study of Diabetes revised the hypoglycemia cutoffs. The paper defined level 1 hypoglycemia as a ‚Äúglucose alert value‚Äù of 70 mg/dL or less. Level 2 hypoglycemia was considered glucose of 54 mg/dL or less as detected by self-monitoring of plasma glucose, laboratory measurement of plasma glucose or CGM. Level 3 hypoglycemia was defined as severe hypoglycemia with severe cognitive impairment and requiring external assistance for recovery.

‚ÄúThe current limitation of time below range is that it is expressed as a percentage instead of events, and events are more meaningful to patients as well as payers,‚Äù Shah told Healio. ‚ÄúAlso, level 1 time below range may not be very relevant for people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin or sulfonylurea.‚Äù

Shah also discussed limitations with glucose management indicator (GMI), which is an estimated HbA1c based on CGM data. It is calculated using a formula that was developed from data in the REPLACE-BG, DIAMOND-T1D and DIAMOND-T2D clinical trials. Shah said the mean HbA1c of the population was 7.3%, meaning GMI may overestimate HbA1c in people with an HbA1c of less than 6.5%, and underestimate the figure in people with an HbA1c more than 10%.

‚ÄúGMI is a mathematic estimation of HbA1c, while HbA1c is physiological glycation and hence GMI is not necessarily equal to HbA1c for all people with diabetes,‚Äù Shah told Healio.

Shah said the limitations of HbA1c and CGM metrics mean providers need to individualize care and take all data into account when managing a person‚Äôs diabetes.

Key takeaways:
--------------

*   Studies on the beta-blocker bisoprolol and dupilumab presented at the ATS Conference gained attention from clinicians on X.
*   Ensifentrine/Ohtuvayre was also discussed on X because of its FDA approval.

In the first half of 2024, many posts on X, formerly Twitter, from U.S. health care professionals discussing COPD treatments focused on beta-blockers, dupilumab and ensifentrine, according to a tracker from Creation Healthcare.

In an analysis spanning January to June 2024, Creation Healthcare evaluated 1,493 COPD-related posts on X, to find out major topics discussed by U.S. health care professionals (HCPs) on this platform.

These COPD-related posts came from a total of 750 HCPs, according to the release.

[As Healio previously reported](https://www.healio.com/news/pulmonology/20240812/clinicians-discuss-copd-ventilation-support-medications-on-x-in-first-half-of-2024), one of the topics captured by researchers was discussion on COPD therapy types.

Another main topic that was tracked in this analysis was COPD treatments, and much of the online conversation about these treatments took place during the American Thoracic Society International Conference.

‚ÄúDuring the week of the ATS 2024 Conference, the volume of HCP posts was 269% higher than usual,‚Äù **Jamie Doggett,** associate director of research at Creation Healthcare, told Healio.

Two specific studies presented at the conference gained attention from HCPs on X. The first one was simultaneously published in _JAMA_ and found that treatment with [beta-blocker bisoprolol](https://www.healio.com/news/pulmonology/20240522/betablocker-bisoprolol-fails-to-lower-copd-exacerbations-in-patients-at-high-risk) yielded a similar yearly rate of COPD exacerbations that require oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics to placebo.

An additional outcome of this study was that both the bisoprolol group and the placebo group had around 14% of patients who experienced serious adverse events.

The finding that the beta-blocker did not raise the rate of serious adverse events was the takeaway highlighted by **Michal Pazdernik, MD, PhD, FESC**, deputy director for education in the cardiology department at IKEM Prague, when [he posted about the study](https://x.com/PragueICU/status/1792842994929770790) on May 21. As of Aug. 1, the post had 47 reposts and 133 likes.

Another popular post stating that use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD is OK came from **Josh Farkas, MD**, assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Vermont, on April 15. In [the post](https://x.com/RaymondJFoley1/status/1780358888136515609), he also asks politely to ‚Äústop propagating the myth that you can‚Äôt use beta-blockers in COPD patients.‚Äù As of Aug. 1, the post had 51 reposts, 288 likes and 58 bookmarks.

The second study presented at ATS that sparked discussion among HCPs on X was the NOTUS trial. [As Healio previously reported](https://www.healio.com/news/pulmonology/20240531/dupilumab-lowers-exacerbations-betters-lung-function-in-copd-with-type-2-inflammation), with dupilumab (Dupixent; Regeneron, Sanofi) vs. placebo, adults with moderate to severe COPD and type 2 inflammation experienced fewer exacerbations and had better lung function at week 52. Notably, this study was simultaneously published in _The New England Journal of Medicine_.

‚ÄúOverall, there were 20 individual HCP mentions of the NOTUS trial,‚Äù Doggett told Healio.

Prior to the ATS conference, **MeiLan K. Han, MD, MS**, professor of medicine and chief of pulmonology and critical care medicine at the University of Michigan, [mentioned dupilumab in a post](https://x.com/meilan_han/status/1771327500775297359) on March 22, which was around a month after the [FDA granted priority review](https://www.healio.com/news/pulmonology/20240223/fda-grants-priority-review-to-dupilumab-for-copd-with-type-2-inflammation) to the drug for COPD with type 2 inflammation.

One additional COPD treatment that gained attention on X was ensifentrine (Ohtuvayre; Verona Pharma) because the [FDA approved](https://www.healio.com/news/pulmonology/20240627/fda-approves-ohtuvayre-as-maintenance-treatment-for-copd) the phosphodiesterase enzyme 3 and 4 inhibitor for treating adults with COPD in late June.

This announcement was [posted](https://x.com/VeronaPharma/status/1806072375529902292) on the official Verona Pharma account and had 17 reposts and 37 likes as of Aug. 1. The release from Creation Healthcare noted that excitement from HCPs over this news was seen on X.

=====================================================================

A clinical trial that will test three drugs concurrently, and could include more, represents new hope for patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that usually kills within seven years after symptoms start.

Researchers hope the trial, which will be led by UC San Francisco and conducted at up to 50 sites nationwide, will lead to the development of new therapies. There are currently no drugs to stall the disease's deadly progression.

The trial is made possible by a five-year grant of up to $75.4 million from the National Institute on Aging (NIA), which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It is among the largest grants that UCSF has received in recent years for a neurodegenerative disorder.

> The hope is that the study will transform the type of care that patients with PSP receive. If none of the first three drugs are effective, we will continue trying with other drugs. Even if we slow the progression of the disease by 20%, 30%, that's a meaningful impact on a condition with relentless progression and no cure.""
> 
> Julio Rojas, MD, PhD, of the UCSF Department of Neurology, Memory and Aging Center and the Weill Institute for Neurosciences, and a principal investigator of the trial

PSP is believed to be triggered by a buildup of tau protein that causes brain cells to weaken and die. It is frequently mistaken for Parkinson's disease. Both conditions are movement disorders, but PSP is far less common, affecting approximately 30,000 Americans, most of whom are in their fifties to seventies.

Richardson's syndrome is the most common form of PSP. In addition to cognitive difficulties, symptoms include slowness, stiffness, falling backward and difficulty with eye movement, especially looking down.

An innovative study design
--------------------------

The three drugs will be tested using a platform clinical trial model similar to one used for a study of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder that is much better known and better funded than PSP, although they both affect similar numbers of people. The trial is designed to reduce the time it takes to find effective therapies, decrease the number of participants on placebo and discontinue therapies as soon as they have demonstrated they are ineffective.

""Unlike typical clinical trials, platform trials can remain open with multiple new therapies tested in successive cycles if the first ones don't work,"" said Adam Boxer, MD, PhD, endowed professor in memory and aging at the UCSF Department of Neurology, as well as a principal investigator in the trial. ""This means there are more opportunities to identify effective treatments in a faster timeframe, with lower cost and less burden to participants. Patients on the PSP trial will have a 75% chance of treatment with an active drug and after one year, all participants will have the opportunity to receive a drug.""

In addition, data, imaging and biospecimens from the trial will be shared with PSP researchers worldwide, Boxer noted.

Rojas and Boxer, together with principal investigators Irene Litvan, MD, from UC San Diego and Anne-Marie Wills, MD, from Massachusetts General Hospital, along with other experts and patient representatives will help select the first three drugs to be tested in the PSP trial platform.

Enrollment of diverse populations a high priority
-------------------------------------------------

The study will focus on enrolling participants who are underrepresented in clinical trials.

""We will build on experience from other community engaged research programs and develop relationships with Spanish-speaking communities,"" Rojas said. ""These participants would be served by Spanish-speaking clinicians, including a neuropsychologist conducting assessments in Spanish. Similar efforts will be made in the African American and other medically underserved communities.""

Practical and financial barriers may be eliminated by covering transportation and hotel costs, he added.

The nonprofit organization CurePSP will be collaborating with UCSF and other trial sites to recruit participants. According to Kristophe Diaz, PhD, the organization's executive director and chief science officer, the trial ""marks a pivotal step forward"" in bringing renewed hope to patients and families.

""Families ask us how they can fight back, but often the most we can offer is guidance on building a support network and assembling a care team,"" he said. ""This platform is a beacon of hope, bringing us closer to effective treatments and ultimately a cure.""

Enrollment is expected to start in fall 2025. It will be open to patients with Richardson's syndrome, which affects about 70% of patients with PSP. These patients must have had progressive symptoms for fewer than five years and be accompanied by a care partner.

==============================================================================================================

BOSTON and SHANGHAI, Sept. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Skyline Therapeutics, an innovation-driven gene therapy company committed to developing unique and novel solutions for rare and severe diseases, announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for SKG1108, a novel one-time intravitreally delivered gene therapy for the treatment of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). This designation reflects the recognition by the FDA of the potential of SKG1108 for treating RP. The ODD grants special status to SKG1108 and qualifies it for various benefits, which will greatly accelerate the development of the drug and enhance patient access to the leading-edge therapeutic solution.

SKG1108 is a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector with innovative design, utilizing the novel intravitreal capsid AAV.0106 to deliver single-stranded DNA encoding light-activatable proteins directly to the retina. The protein, regulated by specific genetic elements, aims to improve or restore visual function by generating new photo-sensing cells, thereby compensating for the loss of rod and cone photoreceptors in patients with late-stage RP, agnostic on the specific gene or genetic mutation responsible for the condition.

RP is a type of inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) linked to mutations in over 100 different genes or loci, all leading to progressive vision loss. While the age of onset is varied, most RP patients are classified as legally blind by their 40s. The disease typically begins with the degeneration of rod cells, followed by the gradual loss of cone cells, and ultimately leads to the near-complete loss of all photoreceptor cells, leaving the retina non-functional and resulting in blindness. Currently, there are no effective treatments worldwide that can halt or reverse photoreceptor degeneration. Existing therapies targeting specific mutant genes apply only to a small subset of RP patients. SKG1108, an innovative gene therapy that employs a novel approach to improve or restore patients' visual perception and acuity independent of the underlying genetic defects, holds great potential to benefit a broader range of RP patients.

**About Orphan Drug Designation (ODD)**  
Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) is a status granted by the FDA to drugs or biological products that show promise in treating, preventing, or diagnosing rare diseases. The goal of granting ODD is to encourage innovation and research in the development of treatments for rare diseases and to make these treatments available more quickly. ODD qualifies drug sponsors for incentives including tax credits for qualified clinical trials, exemption from the prescription drug user fees, and potential seven years of market exclusivity after approval.

**About Skyline Therapeutics**  
Skyline Therapeutics is an innovation-driven, clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing unique and novel solutions to address unmet needs in rare and severe diseases. Leveraging our cutting-edge adeno-associated virus (AAV) platform, which includes multiple proprietary technologies for capsid discovery, transgene design, and vector engineering, as well as robust in-house process development and GMP manufacturing, we are advancing a diverse pipeline of gene therapies for ocular, neurological, and cardiovascular disorders.

Title: Meat consumption and incident type 2 diabetes: an individual-participant federated meta-analysis of 1¬∑97 million adults with 100‚Äà000 incident cases from 31 cohorts in 20 countries

URL Source: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00179-7/fulltext

Summary
-------

### Background

Meat consumption could increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, evidence is largely based on studies of European and North American populations, with heterogeneous analysis strategies and a greater focus on red meat than on poultry. We aimed to investigate the associations of unprocessed red meat, processed meat, and poultry consumption with type 2 diabetes using data from worldwide cohorts and harmonised analytical approaches.

### Methods

This individual-participant federated meta-analysis involved data from 31 cohorts participating in the InterConnect project. Cohorts were from the region of the Americas (n=12) and the Eastern Mediterranean (n=2), European (n=9), South-East Asia (n=1), and Western Pacific (n=7) regions. Access to individual-participant data was provided by each cohort; participants were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 18 years or older and had available data on dietary consumption and incident type 2 diabetes and were excluded if they had a diagnosis of any type of diabetes at baseline or missing data. Cohort-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated for each meat type, adjusted for potential confounders (including BMI), and pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis, with meta-regression to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity.

### Findings

Among 1‚Äà966‚Äà444 adults eligible for participation, 107‚Äà271 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified during a median follow-up of 10 (IQR 7‚Äì15) years. Median meat consumption across cohorts was 0‚Äì110 g/day for unprocessed red meat, 0‚Äì49 g/day for processed meat, and 0‚Äì72 g/day for poultry. Greater consumption of each of the three types of meat was associated with increased incidence of type 2 diabetes, with HRs of 1¬∑10 (95% CI 1¬∑06‚Äì1¬∑15) per 100 g/day of unprocessed red meat (I¬≤=61%), 1¬∑15 (1¬∑11‚Äì1¬∑20) per 50 g/day of processed meat (I¬≤=59%), and 1¬∑08 (1¬∑02‚Äì1¬∑14) per 100 g/day of poultry (I¬≤=68%). Positive associations between meat consumption and type 2 diabetes were observed in North America and in the European and Western Pacific regions; the CIs were wide in other regions. We found no evidence that the heterogeneity was explained by age, sex, or BMI. The findings for poultry consumption were weaker under alternative modelling assumptions. Replacing processed meat with unprocessed red meat or poultry was associated with a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes.

### Interpretation

The consumption of meat, particularly processed meat and unprocessed red meat, is a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes across populations. These findings highlight the importance of reducing meat consumption for public health and should inform dietary guidelines.

### Funding

The EU, the Medical Research Council, and the National Institute of Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.

Introduction
------------

Global meat production has increased rapidly over the past 50 years. Dietary meat consumption surpasses optimal dietary guidelines in many regions, and is correlated with an elevated burden of non-communicable diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes affects more than 500 million people worldwide and is estimated to affect 1 billion people by 2050. Evidence from several meta-analyses of published prospective studies shows a positive association between intakes of unprocessed red meat and processed meat and the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, some reviews have drawn contradictory conclusions on the certainty of evidence in this field. Specifically, some studies concluded that the current evidence is weak and of low certainty for guiding dietary recommendations to limit meat consumption. These conclusions were derived from similar published data and results to other meta-analyses, but the data were interpreted differently (eg, without considering biological mechanisms) and through different evidence-grading approaches (such as the burden of proof approach or the GRADE approach, which are potentially influenced by epidemiological biases), and potential conflicts of interest cannot be ruled out. Poultry has often been considered a potentially healthier alternative to red and processed meat; however, the association between poultry consumption and type 2 diabetes risk has been characterised in only a few studies, with inconclusive results. Moreover, published associations between meat consumption and the incidence of type 2 diabetes have been heterogeneous, probably because of variations in research methods (such as the extent of adjustment for potential confounders and baseline-only versus repeated dietary assessment) and variations in population-specific characteristics (such as cooking methods).

Research in context

**Evidence before this study**

We searched PubMed for articles published between Jan 1, 1970, and Dec 1, 2023, using the terms ‚Äúmeat‚Äù OR ‚Äúpoultry‚Äù OR ‚Äúchicken‚Äù AND ‚Äúdiabetes‚Äù, with no language restrictions; this search returned 2583 results. 21 individual cohort studies and nine meta-analysis studies that evaluated associations between meat consumption and type 2 diabetes in populations were considered. The reference lists of these studies were also screened to identify other relevant publications. All the existing meta-analyses were conducted on the basis of published summary data and the included studies were primarily from high-income countries, mainly within Europe and North America. Limitations of these meta-analyses included publication bias and large heterogeneity. Additionally, previous studies focused primarily on the consumption of unprocessed red meat and processed meat, with little evidence for poultry, and had conflicting conclusions. A few reviews indicated that consuming red meat might be associated with a slightly higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes, and some critiqued the current evidence as being insufficient to guide dietary recommendations or intervention.

**Added value of this study**

Our prospective study of almost 1¬∑97 million participants‚Äîwith more than 100‚Äà000 incident cases during follow-up‚Äîexamined associations of the consumption of unprocessed red meat, processed meat, and poultry with incident type 2 diabetes across global populations, in a federated meta-analysis of individual-participant data. This study included 31 cohorts from 20 countries, which‚Äîto our knowledge‚Äîexceeds the scale of any previous research on this topic. Notably, our study included previously under-represented populations from the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions and from South America and south Asia, and we used harmonised data and unified analytical methods. We found that higher meat consumption, particularly of unprocessed red meat and processed meat, was associated with higher incidence of type 2 diabetes across populations. Positive associations were observed in the region of the Americas and in the European and Western Pacific regions; the CIs were broader in the Eastern Mediterranean region and in south Asia. The positive association between poultry consumption and type 2 diabetes was smaller and more heterogeneous across cohorts than that for red meat consumption. Moreover, our findings indicated that replacing processed meat with either unprocessed red meat or poultry was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes.

**Implications of all the available evidence**

Our federated meta-analysis supports dietary recommendations to limit the consumption of processed meat and unprocessed red meat to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Evidence regarding the effect of poultry consumption is less consistent, highlighting the need for further research. The consumption of unprocessed red meat and poultry had a lower risk association with type 2 diabetes than the consumption of processed meat, and further comparison between these types of meat is warranted. This study is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive evidence base to date on the consumption of different types of meat and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and, together with previous evidence, provides support for public health initiatives to reduce the consumption of meat to improve human health and planetary sustainability.

Besides the heterogeneity in published findings, the existing evidence shows a geographical imbalance. The majority of studies are from populations in the USA and Europe with few from Asia and other areas, underscoring the need for evaluation in diverse populations. An analysis of geographically diverse data is crucial for characterising the association between meat consumption and incident type 2 diabetes and understanding the potential sources of the heterogeneity.

To our knowledge, no study to date has conducted a meta-analysis of individual-participant data to investigate the association between meat consumption and incident type 2 diabetes. In this study, we hypothesised that intakes of unprocessed red meat and processed meat are associated with higher incidence of type 2 diabetes and that poultry consumption is not associated with risk of type 2 diabetes, and could therefore be a healthier alternative to unprocessed red meat and processed meat. We aimed to address these hypotheses by estimating associations between meat consumption and type 2 diabetes using a federated meta-analysis of harmonised individual-participant data from diverse populations within the global InterConnect project.

Methods

### Study design and participants

This federated meta-analysis used data from cohorts participating in the InterConnect project. This international research project aims to optimise the use of individual-participant data by enabling cross-cohort analyses without pooling data at a central location. The InterConnect registry was compiled using systematic searches of the literature alongside surveys of other online study registries, investigation of websites relating to consortia of studies, and searches of the grey literature to identify unpublished data. This registry included more than 200 independent cohorts and has established several consortia for conducting federated meta-analyses and addressing specific research questions. Cohorts eligible for the current study contained participants aged 18 years or older with available data for dietary consumption and incident type 2 diabetes. For each cohort, we excluded participants with a diagnosis of prevalent diabetes of any type at analytical baseline, those with implausible energy intakes (<500 kcal/day or >3500 kcal/day for women and <800 kcal/day or >4200 kcal/day for men), or those with missing values for any of the exposures, outcomes, or potential confounders. We attempted to contact 115 eligible cohorts, of which 31 from 20 countries agreed to participate in this study. We were unable to establish contact with 60 cohorts, 11 lacked the capacity or resources to contribute, nine lapsed communications during the process, and four did not have sufficient data on exposure, outcome, or covariates. We classified regions according to the WHO, and the 31 cohorts included 12 from the region of the Americas (Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the USA), nine from the European region (Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and the UK), seven from the Western Pacific region (Australia, China, Japan, and Singapore), two from the Eastern Mediterranean region (Iran), and one from the South-East Asia region (Bangladesh). A third of participants were from the Western Pacific region. Four different methods were used in the meta-analysis of individual participant data. Of the 31 participating cohorts, ten followed the procedure for the federated meta-analysis; ten uploaded their data to a central server in Cambridge, UK, following the approval of data-sharing requests; eight provided summarised statistics following a standardised analysis protocol; and three granted data access through a trusted research environment. All cohorts obtained ethical review board approval at the host institution and written or oral informed consent from participants.

### Consumption of meat and other food groups

Dietary information in the participating cohorts was collected by self-reported approaches: 26 cohorts used food frequency questionnaires, three used dietary history, and two used dietary records. Most cohorts provided exposure data in units of g/day. The consumption data in other formats were transformed to g/day on the basis of variable-specific standard portion sizes sourced from the databases from the US Department of Agriculture. Three primary exposure variables were determined by calculating total consumption levels of unprocessed red meat (eg, beef, pork, lamb, and veal), processed meat (eg, bacon, ham, sausage, and hot dog), and poultry (eg, chicken, turkey, duck, and goose). Consumption levels of other food groups were considered as covariates. Dietary information was collected once in most cohorts, except for in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), the Nurses‚Äô Health Study (NHS) I, and NHS II, which assessed participants‚Äô diets every 2‚Äì4 years from baseline (1986 for HPFS, 1980 for NHS I, and 1991 for NHS II). Total energy intake was calculated using cohort-specific or region-specific serving-size estimates and food composition information.

### Ascertainment of incident type 2 diabetes

We used two different definitions of type 2 diabetes, one as the primary outcome and one as the secondary outcome. For the primary definition, a case of incident type 2 diabetes was confirmed if one or more of the following criteria were fulfilled: (1) diagnosis ascertained by linkage to a registry or medical record; (2) confirmed use of antidiabetic medication; or (3) self-report of diagnosis by physician or use of antidiabetic medication, verified by any of the following: at least one additional source from (1) and (2); biochemical measurement (glucose concentration or HbA1c); or a validation study in which subjective information was verified by a within-cohort validation substudy with high concordance. For the secondary definition, which was more inclusive, a case of incident type 2 diabetes was confirmed if any of the following criteria were fulfilled: diagnosis ascertained by linkage to a registry or medical record; confirmed use of antidiabetic medication; self-report of diagnosis by physician or use of antidiabetic medication; or biochemical measurement (glucose concentration or HbA1c).

### Covariates 

We considered the following covariates as potential confounding factors (for cohort-specific details, see) according to published literature and biological plausibility: sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, and education level), health and lifestyle behaviours (smoking, drinking alcohol, and physical activity), dietary information (consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish, dairy, legumes, soy, nuts and seeds, eggs, cereal products, whole grains, potatoes, fibre, sugar-sweetened beverages, coffee, tea, and cooking fat and total energy intake), BMI, comorbidities at baseline (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cancer), and family history of any type of diabetes. The three types of meat were mutually adjusted for each other.

### Statistical analysis

For the ten cohorts setting up a server for federated analysis, cohort-specific analyses were conducted using DataSHIELD. In the JPHC study, Poisson regression was used to estimate risk ratios, but for all other studies hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association of each meat type with the hazard of type 2 diabetes were estimated using Cox regression models fit to the data in each cohort. In the EPIC-InterAct case-cohort study, Prentice-weighted Cox regression was used. For unprocessed red meat and poultry, a serving was considered to be 100 g, whereas a serving of processed meat was considered to be 50 g. As commonly consumed, 100 g/day red meat equates to a daily consumption of a small steak or a medium-sized hamburger patty; 50 g/day processed meat equates to two or three slices of bacon or a medium-sized sausage. Thus, HRs were estimated for 100 g/day of unprocessed red meat, 50 g/day of processed meat, and 100 g/day of poultry, equivalent to a standard portion size for each type of meat. Multiple models were fitted: model 1 adjusted for age and sex; model 2 further adjusted for education, smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, squared alcohol intake, total energy intake, BMI, squared BMI, and dietary information (see Covariates). Models not adjusting for BMI were also fitted to examine the effect of BMI adjustment on the association between meat consumption and type 2 diabetes. Some potential confounders (eg, waist circumference, cooking method, family history of any type of diabetes, and comorbidity) were not available for many studies and were examined only in additional analyses.

We pooled estimated effects across all cohorts and by global region using a random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was quantified using I¬≤ statistics. To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity, we conducted meta-regression analyses using the following study-level characteristics: median intake of meat, mean age, sex, mean BMI, number of incident cases, dietary assessment approach, geographical area, and duration of follow-up.

We conducted various secondary analyses in each cohort and pooled the results using a random-effects meta-analysis. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis as an alternative approach to combine estimates across cohorts. Effect modification was examined by age (age <60 years or ‚â•60 years), sex, and BMI (<25 kg/m¬≤ or ‚â•25 kg/m¬≤) by conducting subgroup analyses for each of these variables. To explore non-linearity in the associations of interest, the exposure was modelled as categorical or using restricted cubic splines. The main analyses were repeated with the secondary definition of type 2 diabetes as the outcome variable. Behavioural characteristics might be different between participants with comorbidities and those without, or between meat consumers and non-consumers. To reduce potential confounding by these characteristics, we repeated the analysis after excluding participants with any comorbidity (dyslipidaemia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cancer) at baseline and after excluding non-consumers of each meat type. We also repeated analyses after excluding individuals who developed type 2 diabetes during the first 2 years of follow-up to reduce the possibility of reverse causality. For the primary findings, the certainty of the meta-evidence was evaluated by two authors using the NutriGrade scoring system (possible score 0‚Äì10 points), accounting for precision, heterogeneity, directness, and various sources of bias.

We conducted food substitution analyses to test whether one meat type could be a healthier alternative to the other for reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. We computed a logged difference between the estimated coefficients, from the most adjusted Cox model to estimate the hypothetical effect of substituting 100 g/day of poultry for 50 g/day of processed meat. In other words, this example would test the modelled effect of replacing 50 g/day of processed meat with 100 g/day of poultry.

Meat consumption varied by population. The median consumption of unprocessed red meat ranged from 0 (IQR 0‚Äì24) g/day in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) cohort in Bangladesh to 110 (47‚Äì190) g/day in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort in the USA. For processed meat, consumption ranged from 0 g/day (0 [0‚Äì2] g/day in the Golestan Cohort Study [Golestan; Iran], 0 [0‚Äì8] g/day in the Isfahan Cohort Study [ICS; Iran], and 0 [0‚Äì28] g/day in the PRHHP cohort [Puerto Rico]) to 49 (20‚Äì58) g/day in the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) cohort in Germany. Poultry consumption ranged from 0 g/day (0 [0‚Äì0] g/day in the HEALS cohort and 0 [0‚Äì57] g/day in the PRHHP cohort) to 72 (24‚Äì100) g/day in the Brasilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA Brasil) cohort from Brazil. Cohorts in the European region reported higher consumption of processed meat than those in other regions, whereas cohorts in the region of the Americas reported higher poultry consumption than those in other regions.

Over a median follow-up of 10 (IQR 7‚Äì15) years, 107‚Äà271 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified according to the primary definition. The consumption of unprocessed red meat was positively associated with incident type 2 diabetes in the most adjusted model, with an HR per 100 g/day intake of 1¬∑10 (95% CI 1¬∑06‚Äì1¬∑15; I¬≤=61%). Associations were also seen for processed meat consumption, with an HR per 50 g/day intake of 1¬∑15 (1¬∑11‚Äì1¬∑20; I¬≤=59%), and poultry consumption, with an HR per 100 g/day of 1¬∑08 (1¬∑02‚Äì1¬∑14; I¬≤=68%). The positive associations of unprocessed red meat and processed meat with incident type 2 diabetes were significant in the region of the Americas (HRs 1¬∑13 [1¬∑06‚Äì1¬∑20] for unprocessed red meat and 1¬∑17 [1¬∑10‚Äì1¬∑24] for processed meat), in the European region (HRs 1¬∑06 [1¬∑04‚Äì1¬∑09] for unprocessed red meat and 1¬∑13 [1¬∑07‚Äì1¬∑19] for processed meat), and in the Western Pacific region and east Asia (HRs 1¬∑17 [1¬∑01‚Äì1¬∑36] for unprocessed red meat and 1¬∑15 [1¬∑01‚Äì1¬∑32] for processed meat). These associations were not evident in the Eastern Mediterranean region (two studies) and in South Asia (one study). The positive association between poultry consumption and incidence of type 2 diabetes was significant in the European region (1¬∑10 [1¬∑01‚Äì1¬∑21]), whereas it was not significant in other regions.

Heterogeneity between cohorts was found for all the observed associations between meat and type 2 diabetes. There was no evidence that the heterogeneity was explained by age, sex, or BMI. The association of unprocessed red meat with type 2 diabetes was weaker in European cohorts than in American cohorts by 8% (95% CI 1‚Äì15; p=0¬∑022; HRs 1¬∑06 vs 1¬∑13). There was also a suggestion that the associations were stronger in cohorts with larger numbers of type 2 diabetes cases.

Results from the primary analyses were substantiated in our secondary analyses using fixed-effect models for the pooled meta-analysis, evaluating the secondary definition of type 2 diabetes, adding each of the additional exclusion criteria sequentially (ie, meat non-consumers, individuals with comorbidity, cases of early-onset type 2 diabetes in the first 2 years of follow-up), or altering covariates. Illustrative models without BMI adjustment showed HRs of 1¬∑18 (95% CI 1¬∑07‚Äì1¬∑29) for unprocessed red meat, 1¬∑23 (1¬∑14‚Äì1¬∑34) for processed meat, and 1¬∑21 (1¬∑12‚Äì1¬∑31) for poultry; for models with BMI adjustment, HRs were reduced to 1¬∑10 (1¬∑06‚Äì1¬∑15) for unprocessed red meat, 1¬∑15 (1¬∑11‚Äì1¬∑20) for processed meat, and 1¬∑08 (1¬∑02‚Äì1¬∑14) for poultry. Additionally, the association between poultry consumption and the incidence of type 2 diabetes was weaker when using a fixed-effect meta-analysis (HR [95% CI] per 100 g/day of poultry 1¬∑02 [1¬∑00‚Äì1¬∑04]), adjusting for cooking methods (1¬∑05 [0¬∑98‚Äì1¬∑12]), or excluding meat non-consumers (1¬∑06 [0¬∑99‚Äì1¬∑13]). The certainty of evidence was rated as high (‚â•8 points) for unprocessed red meat and processed meat and moderate (7 points) for poultry. The analyses exploring potential dose‚Äìresponse relationships found log-linear associations for each meat type, without any obvious threshold or ceiling effect.

In the most adjusted model including BMI, replacing 50 g/day of processed meat with 100 g/day of unprocessed red meat was estimated to reduce the hazard of type 2 diabetes by 7% on average (HR 0¬∑93 [95% CI 0¬∑90‚Äì0¬∑97]). A similar estimate was obtained when replacing 50 g/day of processed meat with 100 g/day of poultry (0¬∑90 [0¬∑82‚Äì0¬∑97]). We found no evidence that replacing unprocessed red meat with poultry was associated with a reduction in incident type 2 diabetes (0¬∑98 [0¬∑90‚Äì1¬∑97]).

Discussion
----------

The InterConnect project enabled an extensive evaluation of associations between meat consumption and type 2 diabetes using an individual-participant federated meta-analysis, including more than 100‚Äà000 cases of incident type 2 diabetes arising from 31 cohorts in 20 countries. Our findings show that the consumption of unprocessed red meat, processed meat, and poultry were each associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The associations varied across cohorts, but we found no specific factor (ie, age, sex, BMI, number of incident cases, follow-up duration, levels of meat consumption, dietary assessment approach, or geographical location) that could meaningfully account for this heterogeneity. The association between poultry consumption and type 2 diabetes was weaker than that for unprocessed red meat and processed meat consumption, but still suggested a slightly higher rate of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, when replacing processed meat consumption, both unprocessed red meat and poultry consumption were associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes in modelled food substitution analyses.

To our knowledge, we provide the most comprehensive evidence to date on the associations of unprocessed red meat and processed meat with type 2 diabetes, and our findings partly align with previous evidence. Compared with the previous publication-based meta-analysis by Shi and colleagues and others, our study showed weaker positive associations based on estimates from 31 cohorts, 18 of which had not previously published data on the associations between meat consumption and type 2 diabetes. The stronger associations summarised from previously published meta-analyses could reflect publication bias in the previous summary evidence and highlights the crucial role of a prospective pooling project in evidence synthesis. Additionally, the smaller magnitude of the associations we found could reflect regression dilution due to the use of single baseline measurements of dietary habits. The magnitude of the association observed in our study was smaller than that in a 2023 pooled analysis of three US cohorts by Gu and colleagues that incorporated repeated measures of meat consumption and time-varying covariates. However, the estimates by Gu and colleagues and our summary estimates were similar before and after adjustment for BMI; eg, Gu and colleagues reported HRs per 100 g/day of unprocessed red meat of 1¬∑28 before BMI adjustment and 1¬∑12 after BMI adjustment, whereas we reported 1¬∑18 before BMI adjustment and 1¬∑10 after BMI adjustment. The difference in the estimates before adjustment for BMI could reflect a population-specific confounding effect, including health consciousness and dietary misreporting due to BMI and long-term behavioural characteristics that cumulatively determined BMI. Notably, adjusting for baseline BMI provided interpretation under the energy-balanced condition, but could cause over-adjustment; BMI might be on the causal pathway and therefore be a mediator of the association between meat consumption and type 2 diabetes because of an association between meat intake and weight gain. Our approach, showing results with and without adjustment for BMI, covers the possibility of BMI functioning as a potential confounder or a potential mediator.

Additionally, our research provides more comprehensive evidence further to previous inconclusive findings on the association between poultry intake and incident type 2 diabetes. Although earlier studies mostly reported no relationship, the quality of included studies was evaluated as relatively low. A 2020 meta-analysis indicated a weak positive association between poultry consumption and incident type 2 diabetes. That meta-analysis involved published estimates from seven cohorts, five of which were included in our current federated meta-analysis. Our study improved upon previous evidence for poultry and type 2 diabetes by including nearly four times the number of incident cases and populations across diverse geographical regions; we also used harmonised analysis methods and reduced publication bias by including previously unpublished studies. However, the evidence for the positive association between poultry consumption and incidence of type 2 diabetes is still uncertain, because the association was heterogeneous by population and its strength was sensitive to modelling approaches, such as meta-analysis models. A random-effects model tends to assign disproportionate weight to small studies, resulting in broader CIs of pooled results. Following Cochrane guidelines, we reported primary results using a random-effects meta-analysis owing to observed heterogeneity between cohorts. Moreover, we additionally conducted a fixed-effect meta-analysis. In our study, the risk of type 2 diabetes associated with the consumption of unprocessed red meat and processed meat remained consistent between random-effects and fixed-effect approaches, but the strength of the association differed by approach for poultry consumption. This result reinforces the robustness of our findings for red meat but suggests a potential heterogeneous association between poultry consumption and type 2 diabetes risk across populations. Despite the lower certainty in the association with poultry, we can conclude that consuming poultry might be associated with lower incidence of type 2 diabetes than consuming processed meat, as supported by the current food substitution analyses.

The underlying mechanisms that link meat intake with the development of type 2 diabetes are not fully established. Randomised controlled trials have investigated a mechanistic link between meat consumption intervention and risk markers for type 2 diabetes, such as HbA1c, postprandial insulin concentration, and insulin resistance; however, no definitive effects have been reported. Notably, the trials were only able to assess short-term effects of meat consumption on glycaemic traits rather than long-term effects on disease risk. Technologies such as metabolomics have emerged as complementary tools in nutritional epidemiology and the identification of metabolomic signatures for meat consumption is helping to enhance the mechanistic understanding of the association between meat consumption and disease risk, adding biological plausibility to the findings from observational studies.

Meat consumption could affect type 2 diabetes risk through different causal mechanisms that worsen insulin sensitivity, pancreatic Œ≤-cell function, or both. For example, red meat is rich in saturated fatty acids but low in polyunsaturated fatty acids, and switching from a diet rich in saturated fatty acids to one rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids was found to be associated with improved insulin resistance in a meta-analysis of short-term trials. Additionally, meat is characterised by its high protein content, and some research has indicated a potential association between a high intake of animal proteins and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Another potential mechanism could be via trimethylamine N-oxide, a gut microbiota-dependent metabolite generated during the digestion of choline and l-carnitine, which are abundant in red meat, although the exact mechanism is yet to be established. Nitrate or nitrite additives and the formation of N-nitroso compounds during meat processing are associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Small-scale trials have indicated that advanced glycation end products‚Äîcompounds generated when cooking meat products at high temperatures, such as frying or grilling‚Äîcould contribute to oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory response, and subsequently insulin resistance. Meat can be a major source of iron in many populations, but long-term iron intake has been implicated in an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in observational studies and in Mendelian randomisation analysis.

A strength of this study is that, to our knowledge, it is the largest meta-analysis on the topic to date, evaluating individual-level data across diverse populations. However, whether these findings can be generalised to Africa and the Middle East, for example, remains unknown. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the Middle East and north Africa is the highest globally at 16¬∑2% and is estimated to increase to 19¬∑3% by 2045, according to the International Diabetes Federation's Diabetes Atlas. Pursuing additional studies in these and other regions, such as south Asia, is essential to better understand the association between meat consumption and the development of type 2 diabetes. The potentially unique characteristics of meat consumption, the overall diet, and the cooking methods in such regions could aid local prevention strategies and advance our understanding of the mechanisms linking meat consumption to type 2 diabetes risk. This study accounted for a comprehensive range of potential confounding factors and used a federated approach that facilitated the harmonisation of data and the standardisation of analysis methods, thereby decreasing heterogeneity related to different analytical approaches. This study design resulted in smaller heterogeneities in the observed associations (59‚Äì68%) than those from previously published meta-analyses (76‚Äì93%). Nevertheless, a moderate degree of heterogeneity in the observed associations persisted and could reflect differences in study design, the validity of meat intake assessment, and the ascertainment of diabetes, as well as true variation in the effects of consuming meat due to different subtypes of meat products, cooking methods, or physiological responses across populations in different regions. For example, cooking methods affect the nutrient composition of meats, including poultry. In the USA, fried chicken is a prevalent fast food and high levels of consumption could indicate a pattern of fast-food dietary habits in some participants. Therefore, further studies investigating the effects of lowering meat consumption remain crucial to optimise the application of the current evidence to the improvement of public health.

This study has several limitations. We attempted to harmonise the analytical variables and analysis methods, but we were unable to use consistent tool development procedures and data collection methods for dietary consumption, potential confounders, and the type 2 diabetes outcomes. The lack of such harmonisation could have contributed to the observed heterogeneity. Our findings indicate a small association between meat consumption and incident type 2 diabetes, but the true magnitude of the association could have been underestimated owing to the use of baseline-only dietary exposure data in most cohorts, as well as our inability to conduct any correction for potentially varying degrees of measurement error in dietary assessment across cohorts. Such attenuation was illustrated in the US-based Harvard cohort analyses, published in 2023, in which an HR of 1¬∑28 for type 2 diabetes was calculated per serving of total red meat using cumulative average dietary data, but this was reduced to 1¬∑13 when using baseline-only dietary data. Similarly, after using regression calibration to account for measurement error, stronger associations between meat intake and type 2 diabetes risk were observed than when such a correction was not made in the Harvard cohorts. Nonetheless, the smaller association identified in our federated meta-analysis is noteworthy, as it shows a consistent association across various populations. The observational nature of this research raises the possibility that residual confounding might exist, due to unmeasured or unaccounted factors as well as covariate measurement error. For example, meat consumption can be diverse, with varying preparation methods and properties, contributing to heterogeneity and residual confounding. Specifically, different fatty acid isomers or potentially harmful chemicals‚Äîsuch as advanced glycation end products‚Äîthat can arise from different cooking methods and use of cooking fats were not accounted for in this or any other published research that we are aware of. Moreover, potential confounding from varying sociocultural factors could not be fully considered. Meat is a source of energy intake. Imprecise adjustment for energy homoeostasis could occur if energy intake and BMI were inaccurately measured. If energy balance is not a mediator, the observed associations could therefore reflect the bias away from the null owing to positive energy balance from meat consumption as well as relatively unhealthy lifestyles associated with meat consumption. Of 115 potentially eligible cohorts, only 31 were included in the current analysis for reasons beyond our control. Nonetheless, among the included cohorts, 18 had not previously published on this topic, with their inclusion reducing publication bias. Although we considerably increased the geographical diversity of study locations compared with previous analyses, overall there is still limited availability of studies from Africa, the Middle East, south Asia, and central and South America, reflecting an important research gap and highlighting the need for prospective epidemiological research in these locations.

In conclusion, higher meat consumption was associated with higher type 2 diabetes incidence in a global individual-participant-based federated meta-analysis. The current findings support the notion that lowering the consumption of unprocessed red meat and processed meat could benefit public health by reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Uncertainty remains regarding the positive association between poultry consumption and the incidence of type 2 diabetes, and this association should be further investigated. Beyond research on type 2 diabetes, our integrative work stimulates further investigation on sustainable dietary patterns to reduce meat consumption and its effect on other non-communicable diseases, multi-morbidity, and planetary health.

Key Points

**Question** What is the association between use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and risk of suicide death in patients treated in routine clinical practice?

**Findings** In this cohort study of 298,553 adults initiating a GLP-1 receptor agonist or a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor nationwide in Sweden and Denmark, the incidence rate of suicide death was low, and those initiating GLP-1 receptor agonist use did not experience increased risk.

**Meaning** This study provides reassuring data showing that those initiating GLP-1 receptor agonist use were not at increased risk of suicide death, although the study could not assess small risk increases.

**Importance** Concerns have been raised regarding a link between use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and increased risk of suicidality and self-harm.

**Objective** To assess the association between use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and the risk of suicide death in routine clinical practice.

**Design, Setting, and Participants** This active-comparator new-user cohort study used nationwide register data from Sweden and Denmark from 2013 to 2021. Adults 18 to 84 years old who initiated treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists or the comparator sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were included. Data were analyzed from March to June 2024.

**Exposure** Initiation of treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor.

**Main Outcomes and Measures** The primary outcome was suicide death recorded in the cause of death registers. Secondary outcomes were the composite of suicide death and nonfatal self-harm and the composite of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. Using propensity score weighting, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated separately in the 2 countries and pooled in a meta-analysis.

**Results** In total, 124,517 adults initiated a GLP-1 receptor agonist and 174,036 initiated an SGLT2 inhibitor; among GLP-1 receptor agonist users, the mean (SD) age was 60 (13) years, and 45% were women. During a mean (SD) follow-up of 2.5 (1.7) years, 77 suicide deaths occurred among users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 71 suicide deaths occurred among users of SGLT2 inhibitors: weighted incidences were 0.23 vs 0.18 events per 1000 person-years (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.83-1.88), with an absolute difference of 0.05 (95% CI, ‚àí0.03 to 0.16) events per 1000 person-years. The HR was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.97) for suicide death and nonfatal self-harm, and the HR was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.97-1.06) for incident depression and anxiety-related disorders.

**Conclusions and Relevance** This cohort study, including mostly patients with type 2 diabetes, does not show an association between use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and an increased risk of suicide death, self-harm, or incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. Suicide death among GLP-1 receptor agonist users was rare, and the upper limit of the confidence interval was compatible with an absolute risk increase of no more than 0.16 events per 1000 person-years.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are increasingly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Concerns have been raised regarding suicidality and self-harm linked to use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. In July 2023, the European Medicines Agency launched an investigation into the safety signal following around 150 spontaneous reports received by the agency regarding suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm potentially associated with the drug. An effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on suicidality is plausible, as GLP-1 receptors are present in the central nervous system and GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. Previous studies have linked bariatric surgery and weight-reduction drugs to a potentially increased risk of suicide and self-harm. Conversely, it has also been suggested that GLP-1 receptor agonists may protect against depression. This hypothesis is based on studies indicating that depression and type 2 diabetes may have partly overlapping causes, including neuroinflammation, and that GLP-1 receptor agonists show neuroprotective properties.

We conducted a cohort study using nationwide data from Sweden and Denmark to examine the association of GLP-1 receptor agonist use with suicide death. In secondary analyses, we assessed the association of GLP-1 receptor agonist use with the composite of suicide and nonfatal self-harm, as well as the composite of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders.

We used health and administrative registers in Sweden and Denmark, including the population registers, prescription drug registers, national patient registers, and cause of death registers, all with nationwide coverage in each country. The registers provide data on demographic variables and vital status, all filled prescriptions from all pharmacies in each country, diagnoses and procedures registered during all outpatient specialist care visits and hospitalizations, and causes of death. Sweden and Denmark have similar universal health care systems and register infrastructure. Using the same study protocol, we conducted the analyses in Sweden and Denmark separately and performed a meta-analysis of the 2 country-specific estimates.

The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. Informed consent was not needed. Ethical approval is not required for register-based research in Denmark. The study is reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines for cohort studies.

Using an active-comparator new-user design, we included all new users of either GLP-1 receptor agonists or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (comparator) who were 18 to 84 years old during 2013 to 2021. Patients entered the cohort at the time of their first filled prescription for either a GLP-1 receptor agonist or an SGLT2 inhibitor during the study period. SGLT2 inhibitors were used as the comparator because this drug has no known association with suicide death and was used in similar clinical situations (predominantly as second-line or third-line glucose-lowering drugs for treatment of type 2 diabetes) during the study period, with both GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors being recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Both drugs were primarily used for type 2 diabetes during the study period.

New use was defined as initiation of either drug among patients with no previous use of either drug at any time prior to cohort entry. Exclusion criteria were end-stage illness (severe malnutrition, cachexia, dementia, coma), history of dialysis, kidney transplant, major pancreatic disease, use of preparation of liraglutide with obesity indication before cohort entry (the comparator, SGLT2 inhibitors, are not used for this indication; liraglutide with obesity indication was defined using specific product codes), and no health care contact in the past year (to ensure a minimum level of health care contact and registration of health data), defined as neither outpatient care contact, hospital admission, nor use of any prescription drug.

The primary outcome was suicide death (primary or contributing cause of death), including both confirmed suicides and self-inflicted deaths of undetermined intent. Secondary outcomes were a composite of suicide death and nonfatal self-harm recorded as a physician-assigned diagnosis during hospitalizations or outpatient hospital visits. Self-harm was also analyzed as a separate outcome. Although nonfatal self-harm is known to be underreported in Denmark, we used this outcome also in Denmark because underreporting was unlikely to differ between the study drugs, thus allowing for calculation of relative risk estimates. For the analyses of outcomes including self-harm, we excluded patients with self-harm within 3 months prior to cohort entry.

Another secondary outcome was a composite of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders, recorded as diagnoses during hospitalizations or outpatient visits, or filled prescriptions for antidepressants. For this analysis, we further excluded patients with previous psychiatric disorders, defined as any psychiatric disease diagnosis or use of psychiatric medications at any time prior to cohort entry.

Patients were considered as exposed to the drug that they initiated at cohort entry until end of follow-up and were followed to outcome event, emigration, 5 years of follow-up, or end of study period (December 31, 2021). In each country separately, we estimated a propensity score for the probability of GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment conditional on variables at cohort entry, covering sociodemographic characteristics, calendar year of cohort entry, and medical history, including psychiatric diagnoses, recent health care contacts for psychiatric conditions, and prescription drug use. We controlled for confounding using the propensity score and standardized mortality ratio weighting to estimate the average treatment effect among the treated, as this can directly inform clinical decision-making. After exclusion of patients outside of the common range of the propensity score for the 2 groups, and those at the 1% tails of the distribution of the common range (trimming), the propensity score was reestimated, and those outside of the common range of the new propensity score were excluded. Reestimation of the propensity score after trimming is important because the model derived from the untrimmed population is mis-specified in the population that remains after trimming. Standardized differences below 10% after weighting were considered as good balance between exposure groups. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox regression, with days since cohort entry as the time scale. We performed a meta-analysis of the country-specific estimates, with a fixed-effect model using the method of Mantel and Haenszel. The absolute risk difference for the primary outcome was calculated as HR‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ1 multiplied by the rate in the comparator group.

We performed a subgroup analysis for the primary outcome by history of psychiatric disorders, as the investigated safety signal is of most importance for treatment decisions among those at high risk. We also performed subgroup analyses for those who initiated liraglutide and semaglutide, respectively. Propensity scores were reestimated for each secondary outcome and subgroup analysis.

We performed additional analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes. We applied an as-treated exposure definition, in which patients were censored at switch-to or add-on treatment with the other study drug or treatment discontinuation. Treatment duration was estimated based on the number of days covered by the filled prescriptions plus a 90-day period between prescriptions and after the last prescription. Furthermore, we restricted the follow-up to 1 year to assess whether a possible risk increase emerges shortly after treatment initiation.

Due to remaining imbalance in 1 baseline variable after weighting in Denmark (no use of other glucose-lowering drugs in the past 6 months), we adjusted for this variable in Denmark in post hoc sensitivity analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes. As the secondary outcome of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders included use of antidepressants, which can be prescribed also for other conditions, we performed a sensitivity analysis defining the outcome using only diagnoses registered during health care visits.

As the primary outcome analysis showed no statistically significant association, we calculated the E-value representing the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment and suicide death (conditional on the covariates included in the propensity score) to shift the confidence interval toward an increased risk such that it excludes the null. Confidence intervals not including 1.0 were considered as showing a statistically significant risk difference. Data were analyzed from March to June 2024, and analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4.

Population Characteristics

In total, 124,517 users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 174,036 users of SGLT2 inhibitors were included. Among GLP-1 receptor agonist users, the mean (SD) age was 60 (13) years and 45% were women. The most commonly used GLP-1 receptor agonists were liraglutide (50%) and semaglutide (41%). Patient characteristics before and after weighting for Sweden and Denmark separately are summarized in the tables. The propensity score distributions are shown in eFigures. Patient characteristics were well balanced after weighting, except for the proportion of patients in Denmark with no use of other glucose-lowering drugs in the past 6 months. The median (IQR) follow-up time in the primary outcome analysis was 2.8 (1.2-4.8) years for GLP-1 receptor agonist users and 2.1 (0.8-3.6) years for SGLT2 inhibitor users in Sweden, and 2.1 (0.8-4.7) years for GLP-1 receptor agonist users and 2.2 (0.8-3.9) years for SGLT2 inhibitor users in Denmark. Combining the 2 countries, mean (SD) follow-up was 2.5 (1.7) years: 2.7 (2.3) years for GLP-1 receptor agonists and 2.3 (1.6) years for SGLT2 inhibitors.

During follow-up, 77 GLP-1 receptor agonist users and 71 SGLT2 inhibitor users died by suicide. The weighted incidence rate was 0.23 vs 0.18 events per 1000 person-years (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.83-1.88), with an absolute difference of 0.05 (95% CI, ‚àí0.03 to 0.16) events per 1000 person-years. The country-specific HR was 1.44 (95% CI, 0.87-2.37) for Sweden and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.46-1.91) for Denmark. In the subgroup analysis, the HR was 1.25 (95% CI, 0.77-2.02) for those with a history of psychiatric disorders and 1.44 (95% CI, 0.71-2.92) for those without such a history. The HR was 1.35 (95% CI, 0.85-2.15) for those initiating liraglutide and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.33-1.67) for those initiating semaglutide.

Secondary Outcome Analyses

After exclusion of those with nonfatal self-harm within 3 months prior to cohort entry, 124,459 users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 173,985 users of SGLT2 inhibitors were included in the analysis of self-harm. The HR was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.97) for the composite outcome of suicide death and nonfatal self-harm and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65-0.91) for self-harm.

After exclusion of those with previous psychiatric disorders, 72,420 users of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 111,083 users of SGLT2 inhibitors were included in the analysis of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. The HR was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.97-1.06). Results for Sweden and Denmark separately are summarized in the tables.

Additional Analyses and Sensitivity Analysis

In the analyses of suicide death, the HR was 1.27 (95% CI, 0.76-2.15) when using the as-treated exposure definition and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.54-2.28) when restricting the follow-up to the first year. The post hoc sensitivity analysis, in which the variable no use of other glucose-lowering drug in the past 6 months was adjusted for, yielded an HR consistent with that of the main analysis in Denmark. The additional analyses for the secondary outcomes and the sensitivity analysis in which the secondary outcome of incident depression and anxiety-related disorders was restricted to diagnoses registered during health care visits are summarized in the tables. The E-value for the primary analysis showed that an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both GLP-1 receptor agonist use and suicide death by a risk ratio of at least 1.7 to shift the confidence interval to exclude the null.

In this cohort study of nationwide data from 2 countries, we found no statistically significant increased risk of suicide death for GLP-1 receptor agonists vs SGLT2 inhibitors used predominantly for type 2 diabetes. The upper limit of the confidence interval was compatible with up to an 88% relative-risk increase of suicide death, which corresponded to an absolute risk increase of no more than 0.16 per 1000 person-years. The findings indicate that the absolute risks of suicide death in broad groups of patients using GLP-1 receptor agonists are low and any potential risk increase would be small. We also found a slightly lower risk of self-harm and no statistically significant association with incident depression and anxiety-related disorders.

The investigated safety concern for GLP-1 receptor agonist use was based on spontaneous reports of suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm. To cover a wider range of conditions and outcomes associated with thoughts of self-harm and suicide, we assessed suicide death, suicide death and nonfatal self-harm, and self-harm and incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. In randomized clinical trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists, increases in suicidality, depression, anxiety, and other adverse mental health outcomes have not been observed. However, many trials excluded those at highest risk of suicidality through exclusion criteria or based on investigators‚Äô judgment such that uncertainty remained regarding the generalizability of the findings to broader patient groups, and the statistical power was low due to few events.

This study expands the knowledge regarding the safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists by providing data about the risk of suicide death associated with use of the drugs using an active-comparator new-user design, which avoids time-related biases and aligns patients in the exposed vs control group with respect to disease stage. Moreover, confounders were adjusted for using a propensity score, including a wide range of patient characteristics, and the nationwide registers enabled analysis of national study populations with virtually complete data on cause of death. This study supports the conclusions of the European Medicines Agency‚Äôs investigation and the US Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs preliminary evaluation that the available evidence does not support a causal association between use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and suicidal and self-injurious thoughts and actions.

This study has limitations. We adjusted for potential confounders, including psychiatric disorders and socioeconomic status recorded in the registers, but unmeasured confounding may have affected the results. During the study period, GLP-1 receptor agonists were predominantly used for treatment of type 2 diabetes. The drugs are increasingly used also in patients with obesity who do not have diabetes, and the study findings might not be generalizable to this group of patients. Although it is possible that some patients included in the study used GLP-1 receptor agonists off label for weight reduction, this proportion is likely to be low; a Danish study showed that the proportion of new users of semaglutide with no evidence of a type 2 diabetes diagnosis in the register data was 1% to 5% in 2018 to 2020 and 15% in 2021. Moreover, in the present analyses, liraglutide (50%) and semaglutide (41%) were the most used GLP-1 receptor agonists; the subgroup analyses for each of the 2 GLP-1 receptor agonists had low numbers of events, and associations with suicidality could differ between individual drugs. Furthermore, mean follow-up time for GLP-1 receptor agonist users was 2.7 years, and although 25% of the GLP-1 receptor agonist users were followed for at least 4.7 years, risks may emerge with longer-term use. Although subgroup analyses with low numbers of events should be interpreted with much caution, especially when the subgroup hypothesis was not formulated a priori based on a suggested mechanism, the HR for suicide death in Sweden was 1.44, with this nominal risk difference emerging around 3 years after cohort entry.

Some suicide deaths could also be misclassified. In an assessment of the reliability of the cause of death register from 2008, the proportion of suicide deaths with intent confirmed by experts was 81% in Sweden and 90% in Denmark, with few accidents and natural deaths being reclassified as suicides. We also included self-inflicted deaths of undetermined intent in the primary outcome definition, as an investigation by the National Center for Suicide Research and Prevention in Sweden showed that 20% of suicide cases in the country were coded as of undetermined intent and 70% to 75% of self-inflicted deaths with unknown intent were reclassified as suicide after further investigation. The overall rates of suicide death in the study population were largely in line with national estimates in both Denmark and Sweden. Nonfatal self-harm is known to be underreported in Denmark, and the absolute risks of the secondary outcome analysis, including this outcome, are likely underestimated, as is demonstrated by the substantially lower rates observed in Denmark compared to Sweden. We could also not assess suicidal thoughts and self-harm that did not result in suicide death or a registered diagnosis during contact with the health care system. The low risk of suicide death meant that the study had limited power to assess smaller risk increases.

In conclusion, in this binational cohort study including predominantly patients with type 2 diabetes, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared with SGLT2 inhibitors was not associated with an increased risk of suicide death, self-harm, or incident depression and anxiety-related disorders. While reassuring, the study could not rule out smaller absolute risk differences for suicide death, and future studies with more outcome events should be performed as data accumulate.

Introduction

Cancer survivors face substantial economic hardships during and after oncologic care, compounding the physical and psychosocial implications of a cancer diagnosis and compromising treatment adherence, quality of life, and survival. Financial hardship has been the focus of policy initiatives addressing cost-sharing and insurance coverage to alleviate direct costs to patients. However, the role of community factors and structural barriers in the experience of financial hardship remains unknown. We hypothesized that adverse community-level social determinants of health may exacerbate financial hardship for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. For these reasons, we estimated the prevalence of financial hardship among cancer survivors across cancer types and investigated associations with individual- and community-level characteristics.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed the 2021 Health Information National Trends Survey‚ÄìSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (HINTS-SEER), which is sampled from 3 SEER registries. We included respondents of all ages, cancer types, and disease stages in the HINTS-SEER cohort. The primary outcome was patient-reported experience of cancer-related financial hardship (categorized as not at all, a little, some, or a lot). The primary exposure was the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). Covariates included age, sex, education level, income, insurance status, and SEER cancer stage; individual-level race and ethnicity were omitted because community-level race and ethnicity are factored into the SVI and considered a social construct. Survey-weighted estimates of financial hardship across cancer types and for the entire cohort were calculated. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression for financial hardship was performed adjusting for all independent variables. Odds ratios were calculated for covariates, and average marginal effects were calculated for SVI. Analyses were adjusted for sample weights and complex survey design. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata, version 18 (StataCorp LLC); statistical significance was defined as 2-tailed P < .05.

Because HINTS-SEER data are publicly available, deidentified, and approved by local SEER registries and Westat Institutional Review Boards, this study was exempt from assessment and informed consent by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. We followed the STROBE reporting guideline.

Results

We identified 1212 respondents representing more than 400,000 cancer survivors on weighted analysis. The median (IQR) age was 72 years (65-79 years) and the median (IQR) SVI score was 0.41 (0.27-0.68); 59.1% had completed college, 56.5% had an annual household income greater than $75,000, 70.5% had private or employer-based health insurance, and 67.8% had localized disease. When asked about experience of financial hardship, 56.4%, 22.1%, 15.0%, and 6.5% responded not at all, a little, some, and a lot, respectively, with variation by cancer type. Increasing SVI score (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.80 [95% CI, 1.00-3.21]), younger age (50-59 years; aOR, 3.66 [95% CI, 2.37-5.67]), lower income ($35,000-$74,999; aOR, 3.55 [95% CI, 1.94-6.48]), advanced SEER cancer stage (nonlocal; aOR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.47-2.51]), and federal health insurance (Medicare; aOR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.02-2.00]) were associated with higher odds of increased financial hardship. An increase in SVI of 0.01 conferred a lower probability of reporting no financial hardship and higher probability of reporting a little, some, or a lot of financial hardship (average marginal effects: ‚àí12.37 [95% CI, ‚àí24.58 to ‚àí0.15], 3.49 [95% CI, 0.04-7.02], 5.35 [95% CI, 0.12-10.57], and 3.53 [95% CI, ‚àí0.13-7.20], respectively).

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study, approximately 50% of cancer survivors experienced cancer-related financial hardship, with a disproportionate number of survivors who were younger, were Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries, were socioeconomically disadvantaged, and had advanced disease. Social vulnerability was independently associated with increasing levels of financial hardship, emphasizing the central role one‚Äôs community may play in cancer survivorship and the compounding financial detriments of residing in a socially vulnerable community.

Study limitations include a study design that precluded our ability to establish causality, selection bias and reduced generalizability due to sampling methodology, recall bias due to patient-reported variables, and unobserved confounding. Although policy efforts to curb the costs of cancer care are essential, acknowledging the role of community and structural barriers and identifying socially vulnerable populations for targeted interventions represent a potential strategy toward mitigating financial hardship and delivering equitable cancer care.

**Nina Buchan, Editor of** _**Guidelines**_ **and** _**Guidelines in Practice**_**, Highlights the Benefits of Online Access as** _**Guidelines**_ **Goes Exclusively Digital for 2025**

In 2025, _Guidelines_ will become an exclusively digital publication, giving primary care practitioners easy access to the complete catalogue of more than 250 clinical guideline summaries. The change will help _Guidelines_ to keep pace with the evolving needs of healthcare professionals while responding to challenges such as sustainability. This article highlights the benefits of accessing _Guidelines_ online and through the Medscape App, charting the successes that have made _Guidelines_ the trusted source of information it is today.

### What Will Change When _Guidelines_ Goes Exclusively Digital?

There will be no change in the quality or number of clinical summaries produced; in fact, online, primary care practitioners will have easy access to the whole catalogue of clinical summaries rather than the selection featured in the print handbook. Accessing _Guidelines_ online means that the latest summaries are available wherever and whenever needed.

In addition, online _Guidelines_ summaries feature useful signposts to related resources on the same guidance, such as _Guidelines in Practice_ articles or Primary Care Hacks. Finally, becoming exclusively digital is a more sustainable choice, saving paper, plastic, power, and transport.

### Building on the Successes of the _Guidelines_ Handbook¬†

For 27 years, the _Guidelines_ print handbook has delivered the latest clinical guideline summaries to GP surgeries around the UK. At its peak, the _Guidelines_ handbook was issued four times a year to an audience of 30,000 GPs, nurses, and clinical pharmacists working in UK primary care, delivering a selection of summaries of new, recently updated, and topical clinical guidance.

The 2022/23 GP Media Survey, which examined the media preferences of 568 GPs, determined that:
- clinical guidelines were the most valuable source of information to GPs
- 93% of GPs had sought clinical guidelines in the preceding 4 weeks.

In 2022, _Guidelines_ conducted a survey of the reading habits of 890 healthcare professionals, and found that:
- 78.3% used _Guidelines_ regularly to access clinical guidelines, second only to NICE
- 90% used _Guidelines_ to keep abreast of guidance updates
- 66% had changed or adapted their clinical practice as a result of reading _Guidelines_.

Since its inception, _Guidelines_ has met the needs of its audience by producing concise, easily navigable summaries of key clinical guidelines, highlighting the recommendations that have changed to help healthcare professionals working in primary care keep pace with guidance updates. Its editors and editorial advisory consultants have collaborated to produce accurate summaries of guidance by over 70 independent professional bodies, generating a catalogue of summaries across 29 clinical areas to support primary care with the implementation of best practice.

Some of the biggest successes in the history of _Guidelines_ include the creation at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic of the _Key COVID-19 guidance hub_‚Äîa one-stop repository of guidance, information, and resources on all aspects of COVID-19 for UK primary care practitioners trying to navigate the rapidly evolving situation. More recently, _Guidelines_ has benefited from working in partnership with NICE, enabling faster publication of summaries of new and updated guidelines.

_Guidelines_ will continue to innovate in 2025 and beyond, to support primary care in the delivery of best-practice care

Get the Latest Guidance at Your Fingertips

_Guidelines_ will continue to deliver summaries of the latest clinical guidance to primary care practitioners‚Äîvisit www.medscape.co.uk/primary-care-guidelines for free access to the complete catalogue, alongside a host of other point-of-care tools and resources.

_Guidelines_ can also be accessed for free via the Medscape App‚Äîaccess summaries, articles, and much more by downloading the Medscape App at www.medscape.com/public/medscapeapp.

TOPLINE:
--------

In a UK survey, participants said they supported the idea of weight screening and offers of weight management at dental appointments.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   A cross-sectional survey of 3463 adults from dental practices and community and hospital settings in England and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Be Part of Research initiative.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Most participants (85%) reported attending a dental checkup in the past 12 months, and 71.2% said they would like to lose weight.
*   Overall, 60% of participants said they would ""yes, definitely/probably"" be comfortable with their height and weight being measured to calculate their body mass index at a dental appointment, whereas 10.3% responded maybe and 28.6% said no.
*   In multivariable analysis, the odds of acceptance of weight screening at dental appointments increased with age (P = 0.004), male gender (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.66-2.36) and non-White race and ethnicity vs White (2.07; 1.42-3.03).
*   Majorities supported the dental team providing information on local weight management programmes (83.6%), having the dental team refer them to general practitioner offices/practice nurses (81.3%), and providing online resources or mobile applications (81%).

IN PRACTICE: 
-------------

""The Making Every Contact Count initiative in the United Kingdom requires all healthcare professionals, including dental teams, to work collaboratively in supporting the public in using opportunistic interactions to support healthy lifestyle changes. Dental teams are suggested to be well placed to provide brief, tailored lifestyle interventions to the public,"" the authors wrote.

""Dental teams‚Ä¶must be supported by their indemnity providers and professional regulators for this to become part of routine practice. Contractual changes must reflect the need to prioritise and provide remuneration for prevention both for oral and general health. These changes would help provide assurances to dental teams that they were working within their scope of practice."" ""Equally important‚Ä¶is to empower the profession through training and establish clear protocols linking with other healthcare and weight management services,"" they added.
