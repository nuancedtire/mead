The FDA has granted Priority Review Designation to SpringWorks Therapeutics and accepted its New Drug Application for mirdametinib to treat adult and pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN).

The investigational MEK inhibitor has been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of February 28, 2025. The rare genetic disorder arises from loss-of-function variants in the NF1 gene, which encodes for neurofibromin, a key suppressor of the MAPK pathway. There is an estimated global birth incidence of approximately 1 in 2,500 individuals, and approximately 100,000 patients living with NF1 in the United States.

""NF1 patients have approximately a 30-50% lifetime risk of developing plexiform neurofibromas, or PN, which are tumors that grow in an infiltrative pattern along the peripheral nerve sheath and that can cause severe disfigurement, pain and functional impairment; in rare cases, NF1-PN may be fatal,"" stated Spring Works.

Submission to the FDA included data from the phase 2b ReNeu trial (NCT03962543) evaluating mirdametinib in patients aged 2 years or older with NF1-associated PN causing significant morbidity. Results, presented in an oral presentation at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, demonstrated that mirdametinib objective response rates, improvement in pain and health-related quality of life, along with a ""manageable safety profile across both the adult and pediatric cohorts,"" according to SpringWorks.

The trial enrolled 114 patients to receive mirdametinib at a dose of 2 mg / m2 twice daily without regard to food. It was administered orally in a 3-week on, 1-week off dosing schedule as either a capsule or dispersible tablet.

The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate assessed by proportion of patients with a 20% or greater reduction in target tumor volume on consecutive scans in a 24 cycle treatment phase, measured by MRI.

""People living with NF1-PN are in need of new advances and we look forward to working with the FDA and EMA during their review processes as we prepare to bring our second medicine to patients suffering from devastating diseases,"" said Saqib Islam, Chief Executive Officer of SpringWorks, in the press release.

“Plexiform neurofibromas may sit next to or surround vital organs and can cause serious medical complications for patients. While progress has been made, there remains a pressing need for more treatment options, particularly for adults who currently have no approved therapy,” said Annette Bakker, PhD, CEO, Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF); Board Chair of CTF Europe. “CTF is dedicated to deploying its time, talent and funding towards accelerating the development of new treatments. We are thrilled that patients in the United States and Europe could soon have a new therapy available to them.”

2024-08-30 07:52:00,2024-08-31 03:41:58,"### Revolutionizing Anticoagulant Treatment: New Insights on Apixaban Versus Warfarin!
A recent study has successfully emulated the pivotal ARISTOTLE trial using real-world data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. This research indicates that apixaban shows noninferiority to warfarin in preventing stroke, but does not demonstrate superiority. Notably, the influence of warfarin’s therapeutic range on patient outcomes sheds light on treatment optimization. 

The implications are significant: understanding that effective anticoagulation management requires careful monitoring of individual patient circumstances and characteristics, especially when considering switching from warfarin to apixaban. As clinicians, how do you assess the appropriate use of anticoagulants in your practice? Share your experiences in the comments below!

Abstract
--------

### Background

Stroke prevention guidance for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) uses evidence generated from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, applicability to patient groups excluded from trials remains unknown. Real-world patient data provide an opportunity to evaluate outcomes in a trial analogous population of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) users and in patients otherwise excluded from RCTs; however, there remains uncertainty on the validity of methods and suitability of the data.

Successful reference trial emulation can support the generation of evidence around treatment effects in groups excluded or underrepresented in trials.

We used linked United Kingdom primary care data to investigate whether we could emulate the pivotal ARISTOTLE trial (apixaban versus warfarin) and extend the analysis to investigate the impact of warfarin time in therapeutic range (TTR) on results.

### Methods and findings

Patients with AF in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD Aurum) prescribed apixaban or warfarin from 1 January 2013 to 31 July 2019 were selected. ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria were applied to this population and matched to the RCT apixaban arm on baseline characteristics creating a trial-analogous apixaban cohort; this was propensity-score matched to warfarin users in the CPRD Aurum. ARISTOTLE outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression stratified by prior warfarin exposure status during 2.5 years of patient follow-up and results benchmarked against the trial results before treatment effectiveness was further evaluated based on (warfarin) TTR.

The dataset comprised 8,734 apixaban users and propensity-score matched 8,734 warfarin users. Results \[hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)\] confirmed apixaban noninferiority for stroke or systemic embolism (SE) \[CPRD 0.98 (0.82,1.19) versus trial 0.79 (0.66,0.95)\] and death from any cause \[CPRD 1.03 (0.93,1.14) versus trial 0.89 (0.80,0.998)\] but did not indicate apixaban superiority. Absolute event rates for stroke/SE were similar for apixaban in CPRD Aurum and ARISTOTLE (1.27%/year), whereas a lower event rate was observed for warfarin (CPRD Aurum 1.29%/year, ARISTOTLE 1.60%/year).

Analysis by TTR suggested similar effectiveness of apixaban compared with poorly controlled warfarin (TTR < 0.75) for stroke/SE \[0.91 (0.73, 1.14)\], all-cause death \[0.94 (0.84, 1.06)\], and superiority for major bleeding \[0.74 (0.63, 0.86)\]. However, when compared with well-controlled warfarin (TTR ≥ 0.75), apixaban was associated with an increased hazard for all-cause death \[1.20 (1.04, 1.37)\], and there was no significant benefit for major bleeding \[1.08 (0.90, 1.30)\]. The main limitation of the study’s methodology are the risk of residual confounding, channelling bias and attrition bias in the warfarin arm, and selection bias and misclassification in the analysis by TTR.

### Conclusions

Analysis of noninterventional data generated results demonstrating noninferiority of apixaban versus warfarin consistent with prespecified benchmarking criteria. Unlike in ARISTOTLE, superiority of apixaban versus warfarin was not seen, possible due to the lower proportion of Asian patients and higher proportion of patients with well-controlled warfarin compared to ARISTOTLE. This methodological template can be used to investigate treatment effects of oral anticoagulants in patient groups excluded from or underrepresented in trials and provides a framework that can be adapted to investigate treatment effects for other conditions.

Author summary
--------------

### Why was this study done?

*   Stroke prevention treatment guidelines for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are based on results from randomised controlled trials (RCTs); we do not know if these results are relevant to patients that would not have been eligible to be included in the RCTs.
*   This study used routinely collected health data from the United Kingdom to emulate an RCT that compared apixaban to warfarin, ARISTOTLE, and also looked at whether the benefit of apixaban compared with warfarin was impacted by the quality of warfarin therapy (measured by time in therapeutic range (TTR)).
*   Emulating an RCT for stroke prevention in patients with AF should help to understand how transferable RCT results are to “real-world” practices and whether this methodological approach can help to improve treatment options and outcomes for patient groups currently underrepresented in clinical trials.

### What did the researchers do and find?

*   The researchers looked at patients with AF in a UK primary care data prescribed apixaban or warfarin and applied a “reference trial emulation” approach, in which the ARISTOTLE trial eligibility, selection, and analysis approaches were applied to UK primary care data and results benchmarked against those of ARISTOTLE.
*   Patients prescribed apixaban had similar rates of outcomes to those prescribed warfarin in our cohort, and our results were successfully benchmarked against ARISTOTLE. Unlike ARISTOTLE, we did not see superiority of apixaban versus warfarin \[hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)\] for time to stroke or systemic embolism: 0.98 (0.82,1.19) in our cohort versus 0.79 (0.66,0.95) in ARISTOTLE.
*   We also found the benefit of apixaban versus warfarin differed for some outcomes depending on the quality of warfarin therapy with apixaban (i) superior only to poorly controlled warfarin therapy for major bleeding \[TTR < 0.75: 0.74 (0.63, 0.86), TTR ≥ 0.75: 1.08 (0.90, 1.30)\] (ii) associated with an increased risk of death compared only to well-controlled warfarin therapy \[TTR ≥ 0.75: 1.20 (1.04, 1.37), TTR < 0.75: 0.94 (0.84, 1.06)\].

### What do these findings mean?

*   Our results support the NICE guidelines on selecting treatment for stroke prevention in patients with AF and also provide reassurance on continuing warfarin in patients with high TTR.
*   We can use UK primary health care data to emulate a reference trial of treatments for the prevention of stroke in AF.
*   We can use the data and methods to look at how well treatments work in patients that would not have been included in RCTs such as those with multimorbidity or patient groups underrepresented in RCTs such as ethnic minority groups and older patients.
*   Study limitations include the possibility of residual confounding, a risk patients doing well on warfarin were overrepresented in our cohort, a lower proportion of Asian participants in our cohort compared with ARISTOTLE, and the likelihood of residual selection bias/misclassification in the TTR analysis.

Introduction
------------

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common type of cardiac arrhythmia with an estimated prevalence of 3.3% in UK adults aged ≥35 years \[[1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref001)\]. AF is a risk factor for stroke; patients with AF have a 5-fold increased risk of stroke compared with people without AF \[[2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref002)\], and around a quarter of all strokes are attributed to this arrhythmia \[[3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref003)\]. In addition, increased levels of mortality, morbidity, and disability with longer hospital stays are observed in stroke patients with AF compared with stroke patients without AF \[[4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref004),[5](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref005)\].

Pharmacological therapy recommended to reduce the risk of stroke in AF includes the use of oral anticoagulants (OACs). The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for AF since 2012 in the United Kingdom provided a choice of treatment alongside the older OAC class of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, which has been available for over 60 years. The VKA OACs require regular monitoring of international normalised ratio (INR) to keep patients in the optimal therapeutic range (typically 2.0 to 3.0) in which risk of both ischemic and bleeding events are minimised \[[6](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref006)\]. A patient may require dose adjustments to stay within their INR target range. A key measure of quality of warfarin treatment is, therefore, the time in therapeutic range (TTR), which estimates the proportion of time a patient has spent with INR within optimal range. A TTR of 0.75 or greater is often considered as indicating optimal INR control and suggests a patient is spending a high proportion of their time in their INR target range.

ARISTOTLE was a pivotal randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the DOAC apixaban designed to demonstrate noninferiority compared with warfarin in the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) in patients with AF. The results demonstrated superiority of apixaban over warfarin for both prevention of stroke/SE and safety (major bleeding) \[[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref007)\]. Results in the European Union patient subset from the trial suggested the observed superiority of apixaban might be dependent on how well warfarin therapy was managed in the comparator group \[[8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref008)\], an analysis that has not yet been performed outside of trial settings. In the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) review of ARISTOTLE, several professional groups noted the TTR of warfarin users in ARISTOTLE may be lower than what is typical in UK clinical practice \[[9](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref009)\].

Treatment guidelines for DOACs are based on evidence from RCTs; however, it is unclear whether these results extend to patient groups typically excluded from trials such as those with increased bleeding risk or severe comorbidities. While there have been a number of previous studies of DOAC effectiveness using noninterventional data, there remains uncertainty on whether the data sources and methods used have fully accounted for the lack of treatment randomisation and issues such as selection bias and confounding. Comparing results from real-world studies with RCT results is challenging due to differences in patient populations, treatment adherence, and study design. However, reference trial emulation involves use of an existing named RCT to (1) inform observational study design and (2) benchmark results against, providing confidence in validity of the selected observational methods and data \[[10](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref010)–[13](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref013)\]. The noninterventional analysis methods can then be applied, under a set of assumptions, to reliably estimate effects in groups of patients with AF who would have been excluded from (or underrepresented in) the reference trial \[[14](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref014)\] such as patients aged >80 that were underrepresented in ARISTOTLE compared with patients with AF in UK clinical practice and patients with increased bleeding risk that were excluded by the trial eligibility criteria.

There is increasing interest in trial emulation using observation data and in the application of recent developments in pharmacoepidemiology methods involving the inclusion of prevalent users. This study used a framework that involved coarsened exact matching to select patients matching the trial population on aggregate, and sampling of prevalent users in a way that avoids selection bias and emulates the process of screening into an RCT, to construct a cohort of patients similar to the target trial population that included both new and prevalent users. This methodological approach could be adapted to a variety of treatments and different therapeutic areas.

This study sought to (1) create an ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort using routinely collected primary and secondary care data in the UK, (2) benchmark results obtained in the ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort with ARISTOTLE results, and (3) explore whether apixaban treatment-effects in clinical practice are influenced by how well warfarin therapy is controlled.

Materials and methods
---------------------

This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline ([S1 STROBE](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s001) Checklist).

### Study design

A propensity score (PS) matched cohort study with emulation of a reference trial (ARISTOTLE).

### Setting/data sources

#### UK electronic healthcare records.

This study used noninterventional data from UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum, a database containing anonymised data from 738 primary care practices across England (approximately 13% of the population of England with 19 million patient records and 7 million active as of September 2018 \[[15](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref015)\]). CPRD Aurum contains information on clinical diagnoses, prescribing, referrals, tests, and demographic/lifestyle factors and is representative of the population of England in geographical spread, social deprivation, age, and sex \[[15](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref015)\]. This study also used 2 additional data sources linked to CPRD Aurum: Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data, which contain data on patients admitted to NHS hopsitals including diagnoses, admission, and discharge, and Office of National Statistics (ONS) mortality data.

#### The reference trial (ARISTOTLE).

ARISTOTLE was a randomised, double-blind trial completed in 2011, comparing apixaban with warfarin in the prevention of stroke and SE. The trial included 18,201 patients with AF and at least 1 additional risk factor for stroke. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority of apixaban compared with warfarin (noninferiorirty margin of 1.38 for the upper limit of the 95% CI of the hazard ratio (HR) for the primary outcome) and showed apixaban superiority for (1) the primary outcome of stroke or SE (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66, 0.95), (2) the safety endpoint of major bleeding (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.60, 0.80), and (3) death from any cause (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80, 0.99). The ARISTOTLE findings led to the NICE guidelines on stroke prophylaxis in patients with AF recommending apixaban as a treatment.

ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria and summary baseline patient characteristics were used to select a cohort of patients from CPRD Aurum analogous to the ARISTOTLE participants.

The use of CPRD and ARISTOTLE are described in a previous publication \[[14](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref014)\], and the use of CPRD for this project was approved by the MHRA Independent Scientific Advisory Committee ([S1 ISAC](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s002) Protocol). All data used in this study were anonymised.

### Patient selection

#### Step 1: Application of trial eligibility criteria to patients in CPRD.

We first selected HES-linked patients registered in CPRD Aurum between 1 January 2013 and 31 July 2019, who had at least 6 months between registration and the index date. ARISTOTLE recruited both new (warfarin-naïve) and prevalent (warfarin-experienced) users of warfarin with randomisation stratified on prior warfarin (or other VKA) exposure status (warfarin naïve or experienced). To be classified as warfarin-naïve patients were required to have no evidence of exposure to warfarin or other VKA in the 5 years prior to the index date. To enable selection of a similar cohort of patients in CPRD Aurum (including both new and prevalent users of warfarin), the following process was used in determining index date:

\- apixaban users

index date = first prescription of apixaban in the study period;

apixaban user classified as warfarin-naïve or warfarin-experienced at this date

\- warfarin users

for new users of warfarin: index date = first prescription of warfarin in the study period;

for prevalent users of warfarin: a pool of potential index dates was selected containing all prescription dates in the study period, with index date selected at the later treatment-history sampling stage (see step 3).

ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria (Table A2 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)) \[[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref007)\] were applied giving a trial-eligible cohort for apixaban users, a trial-eligible cohort of new users of warfarin, and a pool of potential index dates (with all potential index dates kept in regardless of ARISTOTLE eligibility at this stage) for warfarin continuers (prevalent warfarin users).

#### Step 2: Selection of apixaban trial-analogous patients in CPRD.

We selected a subset of the CPRD Aurum trial-eligible apixaban patients that better matched the ARISTOTLE apixaban participants based on aggregate summaries for the following key ARISTOTLE baseline characteristics:

*   Age
*   Sex
*   Congestive heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction
*   Hypertension requiring treatment
*   Diabetes mellitus
*   Prior stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/SE
*   Level of renal impairment
*   Prior VKA/warfarin exposure

To characterise the baseline patient characteristics of ARISTOTLE, we used the key publication of the trial results \[[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref007)\], discussion of trial results by regulatory bodies \[[8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref008),[9](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref009),[16](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref016)\], and publications on the trial presenting cross-tabulations on key characteristics \[[17](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref017),[18](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref018)\].

An ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort of CPRD Aurum apixaban patients was then selected using a modified form of coarsened exact matching \[[19](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref019)\] (see [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) for details).

#### Step 3: Matching of apixaban trial-analogous patients to warfarin trial-eligible patients in CPRD.

To emulate ARISTOTLE, which stratified randomisation on prior VKA exposure status, patients in the CPRD cohort were matched separately within the VKA-naïve and VKA-experienced strata. A 3-step procedure, based on methods proposed by Suissa and colleagues \[[20](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref020)\] and Webster-Clark and colleagues \[[21](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref021)\], was used to select and match patients in the VKA-experienced strata while avoiding selection bias; this procedure is summarised in [Fig 1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g001) and described in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003).

[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377.g001](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377.g001)

The trial-analogous CPRD Aurum apixaban patients were matched to warfarin CPRD Aurum patients using greedy nearest-neighbour matching on the logit of the PS; a caliper of 0.2 times the standard deviation of the logit of the PS was used for matching as recommended by Austin \[[22](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref022)\].

The covariates included in the PS models are detailed in [Table 1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t001).

The model resulting in the most balanced cohort was chosen with balance assessed by looking at standardised differences across all variables after matching using a target threshold of 0.05 for the maximum difference allowed for any individual variable. Balance of covariates considered to be most important in predicting outcome were prioritised, namely, age, sex, and stroke risk factors.

### Exposures and outcomes

#### Exposures.

Exposure to apixaban (5 mg/2.5 mg) or warfarin was determined using CPRD prescribing records with no restrictions on the dose prescribed.

#### Outcomes.

The primary effectiveness outcome was the composite of stroke (ischemic or haemorrhagic) or SE; individual components of this outcome (stroke, ischemic or uncertain type of stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, SE) and death from any cause were the key secondary effectiveness outcomes. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, and composite endpoints of effectiveness outcomes. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding (including by location—intracranial, gastrointestinal, or other location such as urinary or gynaecological). All outcomes involved hospitalisation or death and were ascertained using HES and ONS data. The ICD-10 codes used in ascertaining stroke occurrence have been recommended as having high positive predictive value \[[23](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref023)\].

### Statistical analysis

#### Methods of analysis.

A prospective protocol was published prior to the analysis detailing the planned analyses (\[[14](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref014)\]; also in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)).

Changes from the planned protocol are described in [Table 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t002).

All time-to-event endpoints were analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by prior VKA status (experienced, naïve). The effectiveness outcomes were analysed using the intention-to-treat principle, and major bleeding was analysed using an on-treatment censoring scheme. Patients were censored at 2.5 years after index date reflecting typical maximum duration of follow-up in ARISTOTLE. Cluster-robust standard errors were used with pair membership as the clustering variable \[[24](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref024),[25](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref025)\]. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed by looking at the log-log of the Kaplan–Meier survival curves and inspection of scaled Schoenfeld residuals plotted against time. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 and R version 4.2.1.

#### Supplementary analyses.

A protocol planned analysis in the subset of patients deemed adherent (with adherence measured by TTR in the warfarin users and by proportion of days covered by prescriptions in the apixaban users) was planned to assess the impact of adherence on outcomes. The planned analysis was not possible due to the apixaban prescription data not providing a useful measure of adherence. An analysis by INR TTR was performed instead to assess the impact of warfarin control on results with all outcomes analysed by TTR (TTR < 0.75 and TTR ≥ 0.75). Individual predicted TTR based on baseline variables was used for patients missing TTR. In order to perform the TTR analysis while maintaining balance in the baseline covariates, inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to rebalance the baseline characteristics, applying stabilised weights to the ARISTOTLE-analogous apixaban users. A similar approach to the main analysis was used with PS models constructed separately for the new users and warfarin-experienced users.

An additional post hoc analysis was performed looking at the proportion of apixaban patients prescribed reduced-dose apixaban along with a comparison of the patients meeting the criteria for dose-reduction against the dose actually prescribed. In this analysis, apixaban dose in the ARISTOTLE-analogous CPRD cohort was assessed and compared against the ARISTOTLE protocol-specified criteria and NICE criteria for reduced apixaban dose. ARISTOTLE specified that participants meeting any 2 of the following criteria assessed at the time of randomisation should have their apixaban dose reduced to 2.5 mg BID: age ≥80 years, body weight ≤60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL. These criteria are equivalent to the NICE guidelines for dose reduction with NICE having an additional criteria indicating reduced dose in those with creatinine clearance 15 to 29 mL/minute.

In addition, to assess the impact of the quality of dose-adjustment in the CPRD cohort on the observed effectiveness of apixaban relative to warfarin, a supplementary post hoc analysis was performed looking at the results in the subset of apixaban patients prescribed the correct dose compared with IPTW rebalanced warfarin comparators.

#### Sensitivity analyses.

Primary and secondary effectiveness outcomes were also analysed using the on-treatment censoring scheme to investigate whether treatment discontinuation compromises confidence in the effectiveness analyses.

Treatment persistence was defined by looking at longitudinal prescription data for OACs; OAC treatment windows were derived in which gaps > = 6 months between prescription dates were considered as distinct treatment windows. The end of each OAC treatment window was derived as the date of the last prescription of index OAC + the number of days supply given in the last prescription + a grace period of 30 days. In cases of overlapping OAC treatment windows, the date of the first prescription of the subsequent OAC treatment window was used to define the end of the prior OAC window. A prescription for a different OAC from the index OAC treatment was considered as a treatment switch. An ending of index OAC treatment with no subsequent prescription for any other OAC recorded was considered as treatment stop. Gaps of > = 6 months with no subsequent OAC prescriptions recorded were categorised as having stopped OAC treatment.

The set of patients who switched or discontinued treatment during follow-up were examined to ascertain whether selection bias due to attrition may have affected the on-treatment analyses (Table A9 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)).

Apixaban was first launched for AF in the UK in January 2013, with relatively few patients receiving a prescription in the first year it was available; we therefore performed a sensitivity analysis with the start of study period shifted forwards a year to investigate the impact of inclusion of early adopters who may differ from later adopters of a new drug.

#### Confounding and bias.

In the study period, apixaban was a newly available treatment leading to the possibility of channelling bias \[[26](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref026)\]. By applying trial eligibility criteria to both treatment cohorts and matching using baseline covariates, we aimed to minimise channelling bias. To handle confounding, treatment arms were matched using propensity score matching (PSM) \[[27](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref027)\].

#### Benchmarking results against ARISTOTLE.

The study hypothesis was that results in the CPRD ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort would be comparable to the ARISTOTLE results, as defined by the prespecified benchmarking criteria. A slightly weaker benefit of apixaban versus warfarin was expected based on the weaker benefit seen in the EU subgroup of ARISTOTLE, and an expectation that the quality of warfarin control in UK patients may be higher than that observed in ARISTOTLE.

The benchmarking criteria for considering the results in the trial-analogous CPRD cohort to be comparable with ARISTOTLE were prespecified and published previously \[[14](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref014)\]:

*   The effect size must be clinically comparable with the ARISTOTLE findings; the HR for time to stroke/SE with the HR must be between 0.69 and 0.99. This range is not symmetrical around the ARISTOTLE estimate of 0.79 as it is anticipated the treatment effect in routine clinical care may be weaker than that seen in the optimised setting of a clinical trial.
*   The upper limit of the 95% CI for the HR for time to stroke/SE must be less than 1.38 (noninferiority margin used in ARISTOTLE, updated since protocol—see [Table 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t002)).

The benchmarking step applied only to the primary effectiveness outcome in the trial-analogous CPRD cohort; results in other groups such as patients underrepresented or excluded from the trial would not necessarily be expected to remain consistent to the RCT results, given the relative risks may differ in these groups. Comparability of other outcomes was to be assessed descriptively with no formal criteria or hypothesis testing used.

### Missing data

Patients with missing systolic blood pressure (0.1%), body mass index (3.3%), smoking status (0.1%), or socioeconomic status (0.1%) were excluded from the trial-eligible cohort as the proportion of patients with these missing was low. Patients with missing renal function (1.3%), ethnicity (0.4%), or alcohol use (5.6%) were kept in the cohort through a missing indicator approach; this approach is valid under the assumption that these variables act as confounders and influence clinician prescribing decisions only when observed \[[28](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref028)\]. A total of 1,176 (13.3%) warfarin users in the CPRD cohort did not have INR measurements in the data during their treatment period with predicted TTR used for these patients in the analysis by TTR (see [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) for details).

### Ethics

Scientific approval was provided by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine research ethics committee (ref 17682) and the independent scientific advisory committee of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (protocol no. 19\_066R). CPRD data are already approved via a national research ethics committee for purely noninterventional research of this type. CPRD data are analysed anonmymously; therefore, individual patient consent is not sought by contributing medical practices when data are shared with CPRD; however, patients are able to opt out of their patient information being shared for research.

### Participants

Between 1 January 2013 and 31 July 2019, there were 86,888 people with AF prescribed apixaban and 159,632 prescribed warfarin in HES-linked CPRD Aurum practices ([Fig 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g002)). Application of minimum registration period and ARISTOTLE inclusion criteria reduced this to 67,539 apixaban and 139,527 warfarin patients. After applying ARISTOTLE exclusion criteria, there were 41,487 apixaban and 101,159 warfarin patients.

See Table A1 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) for detailed list of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Note: For prevalent warfarin users, trial eligibility only revealed at point of random selection into the cohort for prevalent users. Numbers in figure show maximum theoretical number of warfarin users available should they be selected only at a time they were eligible for the trial.

[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377.g002](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377.g002)

Selecting apixaban patients to match ARISTOTLE on key baseline characteristics yielded 9,120 apixaban patients (3,912 new users and 5,208 prevalent users) available for PSM to 101,159 warfarin patients. For 274 apixaban patients, no match could be found giving a PS matched cohort of 8,846 apixaban and 8,846 warfarin patients.

### Application of ARISTOTLE inclusion/exclusion criteria and matching to ARISTOTLE

Applying the ARISTOTLE inclusion/exclusion criteria and matching to ARISTOTLE baseline patient characteristics resulted in a cohort similar to the ARISTOTLE apixaban participants ([Table 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t003)); for example, median age was 78 and mean CHADS2 score 2.4 in CPRD Aurum before applying trial criteria and matching, whereas the median age of 71 and mean CHADS2 score 2.1 after these steps matched the ARISTOTLE apixaban participants. The ARISTOTLE-analogous apixaban arm matched the trial arm on prior VKA exposure, age, sex, stroke risk factors and CHADS2 score, and proportion of patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.

[![Image 4: thumbnail](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/figure/image?size=inline&id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377.t003)](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/figure/image?size=medium&id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377.t003 ""Click for larger image"")

Table 3. Baseline characteristics of patients with AF prescribed apixaban and warfarin in CPRD Aurum compared with ARISTOTLE participants: (i) before and (ii) after applying ARISTOTLE inclusion and exclusion criteria and (iii) after matching to the trial participants.

Differences remained on baseline characteristics it was not feasible to match on, namely, ethnicity (95.2% white, 2.4% Asian in CPRD Aurum apixaban versus 82.6% white, 14.4% Asian in ARISTOTLE) and concomitant medications (amiodarone 3.8%, aspirin 5.8%, digoxin 13.9% in CPRD Aurum apixaban users versus amiodarone 11.1%, aspirin 31.3%, digoxin 32.0% in ARISTOTLE apixaban arm). See [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) for details on matching feasibility.

### Propensity score matching of CPRD Aurum trial-analogous apixaban users to CPRD Aurum warfarin users

#### Results of propensity score matching.

Before PSM, differences between treatment groups were evident for most baseline variables including age (median age 71 in apixaban versus 78 in warfarin), sex (apixaban 35.6% female versus warfarin 43.6%), and stroke risk factors (see [Table 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t003)). After PSM, all baseline characteristics were well balanced (maximum standardised difference .031). From 9,120 apixaban users, only 274 (3.0%) were dropped due to unsuccessful matching.

### Main results

The HR for stroke/SE in the PS matched groups was 0.98 (95% CI 0.82,1.19) ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003) and Table A3 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)). This association was consistent with the noninferiority margin (upper limit of the 95% CI less than 1.38) \[[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref007)\] but did not show superiority as predicted by ARISTOTLE \[HR 0.79 (95% CI 0.66,0.95)\] ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003) and Table A2 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)). The outcome of all-cause mortality also showed noninferiority \[Aurum 1.03 (0.93,1.14) versus trial 0.89 (0.80,0.998)\] but did not indicate apixaban superiority. Absolute event rates for the primary outcome and components were close to the trial for apixaban—for example \[comparing Aurum versus trial\], stroke/SE event rate of 1.27%/year versus 1.27%, whereas the warfarin group had a lower event rate compared with ARISTOTLE (stroke/SE event rate of 1.29%/year versus 1.60% and hemorrhagic stroke 0.33%/year versus 0.47%/year) ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003)). Mean duration of follow-up in the cohort was 1.8 years in the apixaban arm and 2.2 years in the warfarin arm.

### Analysis of impact of warfarin time in therapeutic range (TTR)

TTR was higher in the CPRD cohort than in ARISTOTLE (mean 0.73 versus 0.62, median 0.76 versus 0.66).

Analysis by TTR suggested noninferiority of apixaban versus warfarin in those with TTR < 0.75 \[stroke/SE 0.91 (0.73,1.14), all-cause death 0.94 (0.84, 1.06)\] ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003)). Apixaban was associated with similar hazards for stroke by category of TTR and increased hazards of death compared to warfarin in those with well-controlled warfarin treatment (TTR ≥ 0.75) \[stroke/SE 1.05 (0.82, 1.34), all-cause death 1.20 (1.04, 1.37)\] ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003)).

### Analysis of apixaban dose-adjustment

The proportion of patients meeting the criteria for reduced dose apixaban ([Table 4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t004)) was similar between the CPRD ARISTOTLE-analogous apixaban, warfarin, and RCT apixaban groups (4.9%, 4.9%, and 4.7%, respectively). When including the additional NICE criteria of creatinine clearance, 5.1% of apixaban users in the ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort had an indication for reduced-dose apixaban, yet a larger proportion (14.3%) were prescribed reduced dose apixaban implying some patients in CPRD Aurum may have been prescribed the wrong dose and/or information on criteria for dose reduction may have been missing from CPRD Aurum.

A futher analysis of the quality of dose-adjustment in patients in CPRD Aurum ([Table 5](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t005)) indicated 10.5% of patients may have been prescribed an incorrect dose of apixaban at the index prescription based on the data contained in their electronic health records (EHRs). The majority of incorrect dose relating to patients being prescribed reduced-dose apixaban despite not meeting the criteria for dose reduction. A large proportion of patients prescribed an incorrect dose had only 1 dose adjustment criteria (59.6% of those with incorrect dose), suggesting some prescribers may have thought a dose reduction was warranted when only 1 criteria was present. Other possible reasons for the incorrect dose-adjustment observed here may be data on the criteria missing from the EHR (i.e., incorrect ascertainment) or consideration of other medical history that made a prescriber adjust the dose.

To assess the impact of the quality of dose-adjustment in the CPRD cohort on the effectiveness of apixaban, a supplementary post hoc analysis was performed looking at the results in the subset of apixaban patients prescribed the correct dose (_N_ = 7,921) compared with IPTW rebalanced warfarin comparators. The results in this subset were consistent with the primary results showing apixaban to be noninferior to warfarin (stroke/SE 0.96 \[0.78,1.17\], death 0.97 \[0.87,1.09\]) with the results moving slightly closer to those observed in ARISTOTLE.

### Safety results

The analysis for safety outcomes is presented in [Fig 4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g004) and Table A5 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003); patients on apixaban had a lower risk of major bleeding compared with those on warfarin, HR (95% CI) 0.88 (0.77,1.00), consistent with ARISTOTLE. Analysis by TTR suggested superiority of apixaban for major bleeding in those with TTR <0.75 \[0.74 (0.63, 0.86)\], whereas apixaban users had a similar risk of major bleeding compared with those with optimal warfarin control (TTR ≥ 0.75) \[1.08 (0.90,1.30)\].

### Sensitivity analyses

Table A7 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) shows the proportion of patients switching treatment. A higher proportion of patients on warfarin switched to an alternative OAC during follow-up compared with those on apixaban (16.3% versus 6.1%).

Comparing patients who switched treatment during follow-up with those that continued on index treatment (Table A8 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)) suggests possible selection bias due to attrition in on-treatment analyses with median TTR markedly lower in warfarin users who switched treatments compared with persistent warfarin users (median TTR 0.64 versus 0.78). On-treatment analyses would likely be biased against apixaban since patients doing badly on warfarin (i.e., with low TTR) who would be more likely to experience events in the warfarin arm would be censored at treatment switch.

On-treatment analyses censoring around treatment switch or discontinuation are presented for the effectiveness analyses in the appendix (Table A6 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)); the results show evidence of the expected attrition bias against apixaban when compared with the ITT results in [Fig 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g002), for example, HR for stroke/SE is 1.04 (0.86, 1.25) in the on-treatment compared with 0.98 (95% CI 0.82, 1.19) in the ITT analysis.

Repeating the analysis with start of study period shifted forwards a year to investigate the impact of inclusion of early adopters yielded similar results to the primary analysis (Table A9 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)).

Prior INR control was not included in the PS models for the VKA-experienced due to a high rate of missing prior INR data (missing for 34% in the apixaban arm). A post hoc sensitivity analysis including a prior INR control variable in the PSM gave results consistent with the primary results \[stroke/SE HR 95% CI 1.02 (0.86,1.21)\]. Details of this post hoc analysis are in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003).

Discussion
----------

In our emulation of ARISTOTLE using UK routinely collected healthcare data, we found results that met our predefined criteria for comparability with the trial. We saw noninferiority of apixaban versus warfarin for prevention of stroke or SE, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding but did not see superiority of apixaban versus warfarin for these outcomes as was seen in ARISTOTLE. We found higher TTR in the patients using warfarin in our cohort compared with the warfarin arm of ARISTOTLE (median 0.76 versus 0.66). While our analysis by TTR showed noninferiority of apixaban versus warfarin for our stroke or SE outcome, we observed an increased risk of death on apixaban compared with patients well-controlled on warfarin (TTR ≥ 0.75) but not when compared with those on poorly controlled warfarin (TTR < 0.75). For major bleeding, while apixaban was superior when compared to those on poorly controlled warfarin, there was no difference when compared to those on well-controlled warfarin. We saw evidence suggesting suboptimal dosing of apixaban in our cohort with approximately 10% of patients in the apixaban arm prescribed the reduced dose without meeting the criteria for the reduced dose.

We found the differences in the overall treatment-effect estimates between our cohort and ARISTOTLE may be explained by the lower proportion of Asian patients in our cohort, differences in INR control in the warfarin arm of our cohort compared with ARISTOTLE, and the higher proportion of patients prescribed a reduced dose of apixaban in our cohort compared with ARISTOTLE.

Our findings are consistent with a UK study of ischemic stroke, which compared DOACs with warfarin \[[29](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref029)\]. A Danish study found similar results to ours for stroke/SE \[[30](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref030)\], although they found apixaban users had a lower risk of death; a study of US claims data \[[31](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref031)\] also found apixaban was associated with a lower risk of death. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 studies \[[32](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref032)\] found pooled results for stroke and intracranial haemorrhage that were consistent with ours. One study (in US claims data) also aimed to replicate ARISTOTLE \[[33](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref033),[34](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref034)\] and, in contrast to our study, found superiority for apixaban for stroke/SE, which may be linked to population differences such as lower TTR in US patients on warfarin \[[35](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref035)\] and differences in ethnicity. None of these studies matched to the ARISTOTLE trial participants, included prevalent users, or looked at how warfarin control impacted results. Further details on these studies including design and key results are summarised in Table A10 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003).

A key strength of our study was the use of a framework that sampled prevalent users (the continuing users of warfarin in this study) in a way that avoided selection bias facilitating the construction of a cohort of patients similar to the target trial population, which included both new users of apixaban and warfarin (VKA-naïve) and patients with prior VKA exposure (VKA-experienced) that were randomised to stay on warfarin or switch to apixaban. The use of PSM, stratified by treatment history, enabled us to select a matched cohort well balanced on important covariates. The successful emulation of ARISTOTLE by our study shows that valid treatment effects can be obtained for important outcomes with OACs using noninterventional methods with routinely collected clinical data. Having validated this framework, in future studies, we can look at the effectiveness of OACs in AF patient groups not included or underrepresented in the RCT, such as elderly patients and those at increased bleeding risk. We also recommend future analyses with an extended follow-up period compared with this study to compare the long-term outcomes seen in the noninterventional cohort with projected long-term outcomes from the RCT.

An additional strength of our study was the ability to explore the quality of warfarin treatment in our cohort and the impact of INR control on the treatment effect estimates. Our finding that the benefits of apixaban versus warfarin for some outcomes depended on the quality of INR control in the warfarin arm answers questions raised in the NICE premeeting briefing, which looked at apixaban in the NVAF population and noted the TTR seen in ARISTOTLE “may be lower than what is typical in UK clinical practice” and “apixaban compared with well-controlled warfarin (TTR 75% or more) may not be superior in the long term” \[[8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref008)\]. ARISTOTLE presented outcomes by centre (for example, hospital) TTR quartile and did not show a signal of treatment efficacy differing by centre TTR quartile. We were able to use IPTW to estimate the treatment effect in the different warfarin TTR groups and used predicted TTR for warfarin users missing TTR to attempt to limite the risk of selection bias.

While our study aimed to emulate ARISTOTLE using suitable methods, there were several limitations. Some of the criteria assessed for ARISTOTLE eligibility may not be well recorded in CPRD leading to a risk of misclassification. Furthermore, misclassification of ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria and baseline covariates could be differential by treatment in the VKA-experienced patients if criteria such as renal function are more likely to be checked before changing treatment. However, the most important risk factors for the primary outcome of stroke (the components of CHA2DS2\-VASc stroke risk score) are mostly well recorded in CPRD Aurum and HES.

Our cohort did not attempt to match the trial on the use of concomitant medications in order for our cohort to reflect typical UK prescribing. In ARISTOTLE, 31% of participants were using aspirin and 11% using amiodarone at baseline, whereas in our cohort, only 6% were recorded as using aspirin and 4% amiodarone. Amiodarone potentiates the effects of warfarin, and concomitant use of amiodarone with DOACs is associated with increased risk of major bleeding \[[36](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref036)\], while concomitant use of aspirin increases the risk of bleeding for both warfarin \[[37](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref037)\] and DOACs \[[38](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref038)\]. The difference in concomitant medication usage between our cohort and the trial population may explain some of the observed differences in treatment effects.

A key limitation of our study was the inability to match ARISOTLE on ethnicity, meaning the CPRD Aurum cohort included a low number of patients from Asian and Hispanic groups when compared with the RCT (14.5% of participants in ARISTOTLE were Asian compared to 2.4% in our ARISTOTLE-analogous CPRD cohort). There are known racial differences in the treatment effects of OACs with Asian patients experiencing a higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage compared with white patients; in ARISTOTLE, Asian participants experienced double the risk of stroke or SE when on warfarin therapy when compared with white participants \[[39](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref039)\]. The reasons for the increased risk of bleeding associated with warfarin therapy in Asian patients is hypothesised to be associated with differences in drug metabolism and prevelance of cerebral microbleeds \[[40](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref040)\]. The difference in proportion of Asian patients between our cohort and ARISTOTLE is therefore likely to explain some of the differences in treatment effects seen and limits the generalisability of our study, with the results of our study of most relevanance to white patients. This limitation on ethnicity arose from the data source used and time period studied (patients with AF in CPRD Aurum 2013–2019), which had a low proportion of Asian patients, likely due to AF being associated with older age combined with a lower prevalence of AF in Asian patients compared with white patients \[[41](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref041)\]. While CPRD Aurum is largely representative of the UK population in relation to ethnicity \[[42](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref042)\], diversity is still limited for older individuals. Despite this, CPRD Aurum has shown to be a useful resource for investigating treatment effects in different ethnic groups for indications such as hypertension, which is more prevalent and occurs at a younger age in ethnic minority groups, with similar trial replication methods used to compare antihypertensive treatment effects in underrepresented ethnic groups \[[13](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref013)\].

The approach our study used for handling missing data on baseline covariates relied on assumptions on the relationship between missingness, treatment, and outcomes, which may not be valid; however, the low proportion of missing data means that this is unlikely to have impacted the results. In the coarsened exact matching step, the choice of variables will have an impact on the resulting cohort selected, meaning a different combination of variables could lead to different results. There is a risk that residual confounding may be present despite the use of PSM. The use of PSM also has the potential to introduce bias by dropping patients from the cohort \[[19](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref019)\]; however, PSM is well suited to the process of trial emulation including prevalent users, and a low number of apixaban users were dropped due to unsuccessful matching. The inclusion of prevalent users of warfarin in the cohort risks the introduction of selection bias \[[20](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref020),[21](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref021)\]; this was avoided by use of a method shown to produce unbiased estimates in a simulation study \[[21](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref021)\]. We found consistent results between our new and prevalent user strata across multiple outcomes providing reassurance the method used was likely to have successfully avoided selection bias.

Apixaban along with other DOACs were rapidly adopted as preferred first-line OAC in AF during the study period; it was therefore not possible to match on calendar date leading to a difference in follow-up time between the treatment arms in our cohort. A higher proportion of warfarin users switched to alternative OAC during follow-up compared with those prescribed apixaban (16% versus 6%). The impact of this differential switching during follow-up was addressed in the sensitivity analyses. The availability of new alternative treatments during the study period also means there is a risk of channelling bias in that over time the patients still on warfarin are more likely to be those doing well on warfarin. INR control prior to the index date was not included in the PS for the prevalent users due to a high rate of missing data; however, other variables associated with poor INR control were included in the models, and an exploratory post hoc analysis including a variable for poor INR control gave results consistent with the primary results.

Adherence to treatment was difficult to assess in our study due to automatic repeat prescriptions; treatment persistence was more useful in providing a measure of pattern of medicine use over time. In the analysis by TTR, the adherence of patients using apixaban was not accounted for; however, a previous UK study showed apixaban had higher adherence than VKAs \[[43](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref043)\], meaning we would expect to see better effectiveness outcomes in apixaban. Futhermore, the use of IPTW in the analysis by TTR means predictors of poor adherence are likely to have been balanced between treatments. The analysis of TTR is limited by this being a post-baseline measure available for only 1 treatment arm leading to a risk of selection bias in this analysis—patients with TTR available in the study may be more healthy than those without this measure given that patients have to survive and not be hospitalised to have INR measurements available in CPRD Aurum. The limitation of use of a post-baseline measurement available for 1 treatment arm was also evident in the RCTs of DOACs versus warfarin and is mitigated in our study through the use of IPTW and predicted TTR for patients that were missing TTR (using a model to predict TTR that used INR measurements restricted to the first year of follow-up). Given the risk of selection bias in the analysis by TTR and risk of misclassification of TTR for those missing TTR, these results should be considered exploratory and interpreted with caution. Sensitivity analyses in our cohort using an on-treatment censoring scheme showed evidence of attrition bias. The regular measurement of INR and availability of alternative anticoagulants makes warfarin therapy particularly prone to attrition bias since a patient may be more likely to switch to a DOAC if their INR is frequently out of the optimal range or if they have not been adhering to scheduled INR testing.

To conclude, we found that applying a reference trial emulation approach allowed us to emulate a landmark randomised trial of apixaban versus warfarin using UK noninterventional data, with results meeting prespecified benchmarking criteria based on the reference trial results. This trial emulation method provides valid treatment effect estimates for apixaban compared to warfarin and can be used to determine risks and benefits of AF medications in people treated in routine clinical care. This study demonstrates a successful real-world application of novel methods that have been proposed for the inclusion of prevalent users in observational studies, with the application of an adaptation to mimic the screening process making the method suitable for emulation of RCTs that include prevalent users. These methods could be adapted for emulation of RCTs in other therapeutic areas and for looking at patient groups underrepresented or excluded from RCTs.

The weaker overall treatment benefit observed in our cohort appears to be due to a higher proportion of patients with well-controlled warfarin in the UK clinical context, compared with the trial. Our exploratory analysis by TTR showed similar results for stroke and a greater benefit for apixaban for major bleeding compared with TTR <0.75; conversely, a slightly higher risk of death was observed on apixaban compared with well-controlled warfarin.

A recent multinational, double-blind trial published in the *New England Journal of Medicine* has revealed that intravenous amino acids significantly lower the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The study involved over 3,500 patients, showing a reduction in AKI occurrences from 31.7% in the placebo group to 26.9% in the amino acid group (P=0.002). This is a substantial finding for cardiac surgeons and anesthesiologists aiming to enhance patient outcomes in high-risk surgical environments.

Abstract
--------

### Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious and common complication of cardiac surgery, for which reduced kidney perfusion is a key contributing factor. Intravenous amino acids increase kidney perfusion and recruit renal functional reserve. However, the efficacy of amino acids in reducing the occurrence of AKI after cardiac surgery is uncertain.

### Methods

In a multinational, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned adult patients who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass to receive an intravenous infusion of either a balanced mixture of amino acids, at a dose of 2 g per kilogram of ideal body weight per day, or placebo (Ringer’s solution) for up to 3 days. The primary outcome was the occurrence of AKI, defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes creatinine criteria. Secondary outcomes included the severity of AKI, the use and duration of kidney-replacement therapy, and all-cause 30-day mortality.

### Results

We recruited 3511 patients at 22 centers in three countries and assigned 1759 patients to the amino acid group and 1752 to the placebo group. AKI occurred in 474 patients (26.9%) in the amino acid group and in 555 (31.7%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.77 to 0.94; P=0.002). Stage 3 AKI occurred in 29 patients (1.6%) and 52 patients (3.0%), respectively (relative risk, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.87). Kidney-replacement therapy was used in 24 patients (1.4%) in the amino acid group and in 33 patients (1.9%) in the placebo group. There were no substantial differences between the two groups in other secondary outcomes or in adverse events.

[Markus Weingarth](https://www.weingarth-group.net/), a biochemist at Utrecht University, considers lipid II, a building block of bacteria cell walls, one of the most promising antibiotic targets. Human cells don’t produce it — so targeting it avoids toxicity — and bacteria struggle to develop resistance against it.

His research group recently published a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01696-9) in _Nature Microbiology_, in which they reported that the antibiotic plectasin binds lipid II by forming dense structures on bacterial membranes (1). The findings improve researchers’ understanding of how lipid II binding disrupts the cell walls of bacteria, which can help them develop better antibiotics.

Novozyme’s scientists first [described](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1185723?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) plectasin’s mechanism of action in 2010 (2). However, in their experiments, they used artificial membranes called micelles and showed that each plectasin molecule paired with one lipid II molecule. However, micelles do not accurately mimic the membrane environment. “We took a gamble, believing that what happened in micelles was not the real deal, and this turned out to be the case,” said Weingarth. In biological membranes, the team found that plectasin formed massive supramolecular structures upon lipid II binding. “We saw that the supramolecular mechanism was not the exception, but rather the rule among the lipid II binders.”

**How is plectasin’s mechanism of action different from that of other antibiotics?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conventional antimicrobial peptides selectively bind bacteria based on electrostatics, as bacterial membranes are negatively charged while human cell membranes are positively charged. This electrostatic interaction is fairly unspecific. However, plectasin targets lipid II specifically based on both structure and charge, making it a highly selective target binder. This specificity marks its first major difference. Most drugs follow a conventional ""one drug, one target"" mechanism, where the drug and the target interact directly. In contrast, plectasin and other lipid II binders form massive supramolecular structures upon target binding. This formation is not just a feature but a critical aspect of the mechanism. Without these superstructures, there would be no stable target binding. These two prominent features of plectasin — highly specific interaction with the target and supramolecular recognition — distinguish it from conventional antimicrobial peptides.

The other thing that stands out about plectasin’s mechanism is that it is calcium modulated, which was an unexpected discovery. In hindsight, it seems obvious given the presence of a large ionic pocket that naturally binds calcium. However, this aspect had not been mentioned in any previous publications on plectasin.

**What makes lipid II a good antibiotic target?**
-------------------------------------------------

Lipid II has fatty acid tails and a pyrophosphate head group, which bacteria cannot alter. There are no known cases of bacteria replacing the pyrophosphate group for peptidoglycan synthesis, making it an absolute bottleneck for their cell wall biosynthesis. However, bacteria might be able to develop indirect resistance mechanisms, such as making the target inaccessible. They could make the peptidoglycan layer so dense that the drug never reaches the target. This is energy-intensive and unstable. Additionally, bacteria cannot make more lipid II once it’s captured, so targeting lipid II at these immutable sites makes it difficult for bacteria to develop stable resistance mechanisms.

> We saw that the supramolecular mechanism was not the exception, but rather the rule among the lipid II binders.   
> – Markus Weingarth, Utrecht University

**How effective is plectasin as an antibiotic?**
------------------------------------------------

Plectasin is not effective against gram-negative bacteria because it cannot overcome their outer membrane. However, plectasin is highly efficient against gram-positive bacteria and maintains this effectiveness in animal models of infection. Despite its potential as a relevant therapeutic, I am pessimistic about its future because the clinical development of plectasin was discontinued, and the work was never published. However, plectasin ticks many important boxes: It is stable in serum, non-cytotoxic, and highly efficient against a broad range of superbugs, including in animal models of infection, making it a compelling clinical candidate.

Although plectasin’s future as a therapeutic is uncertain, the study’s findings have significant implications for the design of lipid II-binding antibiotics. It’s crucial to optimize both the part of the drug that binds the target and the part responsible for oligomerization. This aspect has been ignored so far, as the focus has traditionally been on target binding alone. However, target binding and oligomerization are strongly interdependent. Only when both are optimized can ideal target binding occur.

Markdown Content:
Berlin-based Caresyntax, which is building an AI-driven data platform for surgery, has raised a $180m Series C extension.

The round is made up of $80m in equity and $100m in debt — and is tied to specific milestones. The fresh funding tops up the startup’s [$130m Series C,](https://sifted.eu/articles/caresyntax-raises-100m) raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.

It’s the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.

Caresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.

### **AI for hospitals**

Caresyntax says it wants to build the “Android” platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals’ surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.

The company’s platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.

While some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax’s platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.

“Effectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,” they add.

If it does what it sets out to do, it’s a big opportunity.

Costs associated with operations account for [30%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6586534/#:~:text=Older%20estimates%20suggest%20that%20inpatient,healthcare%20costs%20%5B2%203%5D.) of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends [11%](https://www.medtecheurope.org/datahub/expenditure/#:~:text=In%20Europe%2C%20an%20average%20of,less%20than%201%25%20of%20GDP.) of GDP on health.

Founded in 2013 in Germany — Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 — its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company’s revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.

### **The rise of smart surgery**

The round comes on the back of a strong 18 months for startups developing tech for the operating theatre.

Since the start of 2023, three of the four biggest medtech raises have all gone to startups building robots to help surgeons. The UK’s CMR Surgical picked up [£165m](https://sifted.eu/articles/cmr-surgical-raise-2023) in September last year, Switzerland’s DistalMotion $150m in April 2023 and Italy’s Medical Microinstruments $110m in February this year.

Investors in Caresyntax’s round include Symbiotic Capital, MTIP AG, BIONIQ Capital, PFM Health Sciences, Pictet Alternative Advisors, surgical.ai, BlackRock Innovation Capital, Aescuvest, Optum Ventures, Cure Capital, Relyens Group, Vesalius Biocapital, Lauxera Capital, Plug & Play Growth Fund and ProAssurance Corp.

Markdown Content:
UK femtech Flo Health is set to raise more than $200m in equity from US growth investor General Atlantic — a backer of companies like Uber and Airbnb.

The period-tracking app’s Series C is the joint-biggest ever raise for a femtech — along with US fertility startup Prelude Fertility — according to data platform Dealroom. It also gives Europe its first femtech unicorn and takes Flo’s total funding to more than $290m.

All the funds have been committed and a stock purchase agreement has been signed, cofounder and CEO Dmitry Gurski tells Sifted. The funding round is expected to close in coming weeks, subject to regulatory approvals.

Flo will use the funds to expand into new user segments like perimenopause and menopause and invest in R&D for AI-driven personalised insights tools.

### **Europe’s first femtech unicorn**

While in the US just a few femtechs have hit unicorn status — including fertility clinics Maven and Kindbody — in Europe the sector’s unicorn stable has been bare until now. Previously, the largest raise by a femtech startup was [Elvie’s](https://sifted.eu/articles/elvie-uk-healthtech-raise) £70m Series C, picked up across two rounds in 2021.

Flo isn’t disclosing what its exact valuation will be when the funds hit its account, but Gurski tells Sifted the company hit a pre-money valuation of $1bn. ""Reaching unicorn status is a significant milestone for Flo and the entire femtech industry,"" he says.

It comes after a challenging time in the market across the last couple years, says Gurski. “But despite everything, Flo has shown steady, significant growth, after more than eight years of continuous expansion.”

Flo’s revenue in 2023 was $112m — up from $35m in 2022, according to the company’s latest annual accounts. Losses over the same period fell from $35m to $25m. The company has just under 500 employees globally, Gurski tells Sifted.

It plans to deploy some of the fresh capital to increase R&D headcount with “investments in top-tier talent across \[our\] global offices in Europe and North America,” Gurski says.

On longer-term plans, he tells Sifted that, “while we're not announcing specific IPO plans at this time, this funding broadens our range of future paths and gives us the flexibility to choose the best path forward for Flo's continued success and impact in the women's health space.” Gurski adds: “Our immediate focus remains on executing our growth strategy and further solidifying our position as a leader in femtech.”

### **The most downloaded women’s health app**

Flo was founded in 2015 — a year before the term “femtech” was first coined by Ida Tin, founder of soon-to-be rival period tracking app Clue. It’s since grown into the most-downloaded women’s health app on both Google Play and AppStore, according to market insights platform Sensor Tower.

Flo’s platform allows users to track their period cycle and monitor symptoms, as well as providing them with tailored health insights and educational content.

The startup says it has 70m monthly active users and close to 5m paid subscribers as of June 2024. About 50% of those are based in the US, with the remaining half split evenly between the UK and EU.

### **Historically underfunded**

Femtech has long been considered an underfunded sector. In 2023 European startups raised just $191m, a fraction of the $9.7bn shelled out on the wider healthtech sector. On top of that funding in the wider digital health sector — which encompasses the vast majority of femtechs — has been [hit hard](https://sifted.eu/articles/digital-health-startups-are-running-out-of-cash) by the downturn.

But despite that, Flo isn’t the only femtech that’s raised a sizeable sum in 2024. In May, Swedish digital birth control startup Natural Cycles picked up $55m, one of the largest European digital health rounds of the year.

Others haven’t been so fortunate. At the start of 2023, Clue announced it was [making layoffs](https://sifted.eu/articles/brainly-clue-aiven-tech-layoffs-arent-over-in-2023) and audio erotica site Emjoy shuttered earlier this year.

Anogenital warts are benign, proliferative growths that can appear anywhere in the genital region.1 In almost all cases, anogenital warts are spread via sexual transmission;1 very rarely, transmission can occur through hand2 or perinatal3 contact. It is important to note that transmission can occur when no warts are visible, and that the time interval between infection and presentation can be highly variable—an average of 3 months for women and 11 months for men.4 There are more than 100 genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV), but over 90% of cases of anogenital warts are caused by ‘low-risk’ HPV (genotypes 6 and 11).4,5

Anogenital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection (STI), with an estimated lifetime risk of 10% for sexually active people.6 They are most common in 20–24-year-olds, but can occur at any age.7 The yearly occurrence of new cases is usually around 50,000 in the UK,1 although cases have dropped to around 27,000 per year since 2020.8 Patients who present with anogenital warts are also at risk of other STIs ; these may be asymptomatic, and could be tested for and treated at the time of presentation.7

Primary care plays an essential role in providing sexual health screening and treatment. Proactive clinicians can reduce barriers to sexual health, normalise STI screening, provide education on safe sex, and open discussions around psychosexual wellbeing.9

The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) published an update to its national guideline for the management of anogenital warts in adults in 2024.1 Although it is primarily aimed at level-3 sexual health clinics, it contains some important updates for primary care.1 This article offers six key learning points from this guideline for primary care practitioners to consider when seeing a patient with suspected anogenital warts.

Continue Reading Below

1\. Examine Suspected Anogenital Warts Carefully, Considering Common Differential Diagnoses 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If anogenital warts are suspected, a brief sexual history should be taken, including consideration of any new sexual partners, number of sexual partners in the last year, and barrier contraception use.1,10

Anogenital warts can generally be diagnosed clinically, via visual inspection under direct illumination.1,4 There will usually be multiple lesions less than 10 mm in size, although these can coalesce to form larger lesions.11 The lesions are often soft and flesh-coloured, but can sometimes be hyperpigmented or keratinised.1,4,6 They are predominantly asymptomatic, but occasionally pain or itching can occur.1,7

For women, a speculum examination is only indicated if warts are present at the vaginal introitus or if there are internal vaginal symptoms such as irritation, bleeding, or discharge.1 For all patients, proctoscopic examination should be performed if there are warts at the anal margin or anal symptoms.1 Patients should be seen in a sexual health centre if this examination cannot be done in primary care.

Differential diagnoses should also be considered when inspecting suspected anogenital warts.1 Key differential diagnoses of anogenital warts are listed in Box 1.1,6,11

| Box 1: Key Differential Diagnoses of Anogenital Warts1,6,11 |
| --- |
| 
*   Pearly penile papules
*   Sebaceous glands of the vulva or foreskin
*   Fordyce spots
*   Epidermoid cysts
*   Skin tags
*   Granuloma annulare
*   Lichen planus
*   Seborrhoeic keratoses
*   Molluscum contagiosum
*   Condylomata lata (lesions found in secondary syphilis)
*   Intraepithelial neoplasia
*   Malignancy
*   Fibroma. 

 |

2\. Manage Anogenital Warts Based on Number of Lesions, Patient Preference, and Recurrence 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not all cases of anogenital warts will require treatment.6,11 This is especially true of smaller, asymptomatic warts, as spontaneous clearance occurs in around 30% of patients within the first 4 months.7 Nevertheless, a variety of treatment options exist, some of which are self-administered and others administered by clinicians.1,4,11 The current evidence on the treatment of anogenital warts is not strong enough for guidance to explicitly recommend one treatment over others; rather, when choosing a treatment option, clinicians should consider patient preference, number of lesions, and response to prior treatments.1,4 See Box 2 for a list of recommended treatment options.1,4,6,11,12

| Box 2: Treatment Options for Anogenital Warts1,4,6,11,12 |
| --- |
| **Self-administered Treatments Available in Primary Care**
*   Imiquimod 5% cream
    *   patients should be advised that this treatment can weaken condoms
*   Podophyllotoxin 0.15% cream or 0.5% solution
    *   the solution is more effective but harder to apply, so should be given to those with easy-to-reach warts
    *   note: podophyllotoxin is not currently licensed for use on perianal lesions, or for a duration of >4 weeks; however, evidence from RCTs\[A\] has demonstrated its safety in these situations
*   Sinecatechins (_Camellia sinensis_ extract)
    *   mild inflammatory reactions may occur at the site of application.

**Clinician-administered Treatments**

*   Trichloroacetic acid 80–90% 
*   Cryotherapy 
*   Laser therapy (with local anaesthetic) 
*   Electrosurgery (with local anaesthetic)
*   Surgical excision (with local anaesthetic).

**Alternative Treatments**\[B\]

*   5-fluorouracil 5% cream
*   Potassium hydroxide 5% solution 
*   Nitrizinc complex
*   Photodynamic therapy.

### Local Treatment Pathways 

Choice of treatment will also depend on the skillset present in primary care and local pathways.11 For example, if the correct training and equipment are available for cryotherapy, this treatment can be performed in primary care. To this end, BASHH recommends setting up local treatment pathways in conjunction with nearby level-3 sexual health services, and has provided an example treatment algorithm for these pathways (see Figure 1).1

### Patient Education 

Patients should be informed that the aim of treatment is to reduce the visibility of warts and return to having normal anogenital skin.1 Clinicians should emphasise that treatment does not affect transmission to sexual partners and that sexual transmission to a partner can still happen when there are no visible lesions, and healthcare practitioners must also counsel patients on condom use.1 BASHH recommends signposting patients to its patient information leaflet on anogenital warts [here](https://www.bashh.org/resources/52/genital_warts).1

### Follow-Up Review 

It is also important that patients are empowered to return to the GP if symptoms do not improve. BASHH recommends that an alternative treatment should be started if anogenital warts reduce by less than 50% after 8 weeks of imiquimod or sinecatechins, or 4 weeks of podophyllotoxin.1

#### _Smoking Cessation Advice_

The follow-up review is an opportune time to discuss smoking cessation. Smoking is correlated with higher incidence and recurrence of anogenital warts, so BASHH explicitly recommends providing smoking cessation advice to patients with the condition.1,13

3\. Refer Patients for Further Investigations or Specialist Management as Appropriate 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patients with atypical features on examination should be considered for biopsy, as these findings may indicate malignant or premalignant lesions.1,11 Some examples of signs and symptoms that would prompt this referral include bleeding, ulceration, and physician concerns regarding malignancy.1

The Royal College of General Practitioners’ guidance on STIs in primary care recommends that, when there is diagnostic uncertainty, patients should be referred to specialist care.11 Other reasons for referral to a level-3 sexual health service include the following:1,11

*   the patient is pregnant or breastfeeding
*   the patient is a child
*   the patient is immunocompromised
*   there is internal involvement (vaginal, anal, urethral)
*   there is bleeding, ulceration, or another clinical concern
*   the patient has recurrent anogenital warts.

Although contact tracing is not required for anogenital warts,1,4 sexual health services are best set up for contact tracing, so it may be appropriate to refer to one of these services if the patient has a concurrent STI and there are concerns of nondisclosure to sexual partners.14 It is essential that pregnant patients, children, and those who are immunocompromised are referred to sexual health, as these are high-risk groups.1,11 

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding 

Anogenital warts can increase in number and size during pregnancy.1,4 Many cases will self-resolve in the puerperium, so sexual health teams may advise pregnant patients to delay consideration of treatment until after delivery.1

None of the self-administered topical treatments are currently approved in pregnancy, and none of the self-administered treatments are licensed for patients who are breastfeeding.1,3 Therefore, these patients should be referred to sexual health services for treatment with cryotherapy, laser therapy, electrosurgery, surgical excision, or trichloroacetic acid.1 Patients should discuss the implications for delivery with their sexual health and obstetric teams.1

### Children 

If children present with anogenital warts, the possibility of sexual abuse will need to be considered.15 If there are any concerns regarding possible sexual abuse, wider input should be sought from safeguarding teams or paediatrics.15

### Immunocompromise 

Immunocompromised patients are at higher risk for extensive wart formation and malignancy, so should be referred to specialist services.1,16 However, as evidence is lacking, treatment recommendations for these patients are the same as for the general population.1

4\. Prioritise Patients With Recurrent Anogenital Warts for Ablative Treatments 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Studies have demonstrated highly variable recurrence rates for anogenital warts.1,4,7 Nevertheless, patients should be counselled that they are at higher risk of recurrence if they:1,4,7

*   have lesions at more than one anatomical site
*   are immunocompromised
*   are a smoker.

BASHH recommends prioritising those who experience recurrent or recalcitrant anogenital warts for surgical and laser treatments.1 When aiming to prevent recurrence, specific recommendation is given to laser treatment followed by 4–8 weeks of imiquimod.1 

5\. Understand the Psychosexual and Mental Health Impacts of Anogenital Warts 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patients with anogenital warts have higher rates of anxiety, depression, and psychosexual dysfunction than the general population.1,17–19 This may be due to associated pain, discomfort, feelings of shame or guilt, negative views of their self-image, or fears around transmission. A diagnosis of anogenital warts may also contribute to sexual dysfunction, such as vaginismus, dyspareunia, erectile dysfunction, or an orgasmic disorder.18

Therefore, a sexual function history should be taken at diagnosis and, if the patient has symptoms, they should be offered support and reassured that sexual dysfunction is common among people of all genders, ages, sexualities, and cultural backgrounds.1,11 The mental health of patients with recurrent anogenital warts should also be reviewed,1,11 as there can be significant impairment of their psychosocial wellbeing.19 In the author's opinion, the broad skillset of primary care doctors places them in an effective position for exploring the psychosocial implications of an anogenital warts diagnosis and managing any related or coexisting mental health issues.

6\. Offer the HPV Vaccine to Eligible Patients, and Explain That Different Forms of HPV Have Different Levels of Risk 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HPV vaccination programme began in 2008, and has been associated with a significant decline in the prevalence of anogenital warts:1,20,21 in the 2010–2019 period, prevalence dropped by 35%.1 Indeed, there is clear evidence that the HPV vaccine is highly effective at preventing anogenital warts when given prior to a first sexual encounter.20,21 Primary care professionals therefore play an important role in promoting public health and improving the prevention of anogenital warts by encouraging the uptake of the HPV vaccine to those who are eligible.

However, there is no evidence that the HPV vaccine has an impact on recurrent anogenital warts, and it is not recommended as a treatment for the condition.1,22 It should be clarified to patients that there are different forms of the virus, and that anogenital warts are associated with low-risk HPV genotypes, whereas cancer is associated with different high-risk HPV genotypes.1 Eligible patients should be counselled both to receive HPV vaccination and to continue attending their cervical screening at the recommended intervals, irrespective of whether they have been previously diagnosed with anogenital warts.1,11

Summary 
--------

Anogenital warts are a common, benign STI associated with low-risk HPV infection that can largely be diagnosed clinically. Although many cases resolve without treatment, there is a wide range of management options (including self- and clinician-administered treatments). It is important that primary care practitioners are familiar with these options, and are also aware of when they need to refer to sexual health services. Other important considerations in primary care include normalising sexual health screening, promoting public health measures, and discussing the psychosexual implications, as appropriate.

| Key Points |
| --- |
| 
*   Many cases of anogenital warts do not need treating and will self-resolve
*   Patients should be aware that the aim of treatment is to remove the visible lesions, but that sexual transmission to a partner can still happen when there are no visible lesions
*   Speculum or proctoscopic examination should be performed if there is suspicion of internal anogenital warts
*   Clinicians should always give advice to patients with anogenital warts on condom use and smoking cessation, and screen for other STIs 
*   Referral to a sexual health service should be offered if diagnosis is uncertain, if the patient is immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding, or a child, or if they have internal involvement, recurrence of anogenital warts, or another feature of significant clinical concern
*   No treatment option is recommend over others, but podophyllotoxin and imiquimod are two self-administered treatment options
*   Podophyllotoxin 0.5% solution can be more effective than the 0.15% cream if used on easy-to-reach areas 
*   Patients should be empowered to swap to an alternative treatment if there is limited response
*   Patients with difficult-to-treat or recurrent anogenital warts should be prioritised for laser treatment and/or surgical removal 
*   Contact tracing is not required for anogenital warts 
*   Eligible patients should be encouraged to get the HPV vaccine, as it is shown to be highly effective at preventing anogenital warts and cancer
*   Patients with a cervix should continue to attend cervical screening at the standard intervals
*   Primary care practitioners should discuss psychosexual wellbeing with patients, and refer to specialist services if required.

Your goal is to create posts that begin with a strong, specific, attention-grabbing headline relevant to the medical community. The content should be concise, informative, and focused on topics such as new research findings, emerging medical technologies, or best practices in patient care. Include a subtle call to action that encourages doctors to engage with the content, whether by commenting, sharing their experiences, or exploring additional resources. The tone should be professional yet natural and approachable, and you should incorporate relevant visuals and hashtags to increase the post’s reach and credibility within the medical field.

*   The authorization is supported by positive data from a phase 3 pivotal trial.
*   Avanzanite Bioscience has exclusive rights to market Akantior in 26 countries in Europe.

The European Commission granted marketing authorization to Akantior for the treatment of _A__canthamoeba_ [keratitis](https://www.healio.com/news/ophthalmology/20240304/video-oxygen-does-not-play-a-role-in-crosslinking-for-infectious-keratitis), according to a press release from Avanzanite Bioscience.

The decision was backed by positive results from the phase 3 pivotal Orphan Drug for _Acanthamoeba_ Keratitis (ODAK) trial, which included 135 patients. Of these patients, 84.8% were cured of _A__canthamoeba_ keratitis (AK) after treatment with Akantior (polyhexanide, Avanzanite Bioscience). In addition, 66.7% of patients achieved full vision restoration without the need for optical [cornea transplants](https://www.healio.com/news/ophthalmology/20240718/blog-choose-the-transplantsaving-path).

URL Source: https://sifted.eu/articles/medtech-startup-vc-trends/

Markdown Content:
Medtech has had a mixed few years. In 2023, startups in the sector raised $2.2bn with 2024 looking similar — roughly half of the $4bn picked up in 2021, according to [Sifted data.](https://sifted.eu/pro/briefings/medtech-2024)

But there have still been some sizable rounds in recent times. Since the start of 2023, surgical robotics startups have been the biggest winners. The UK’s CMR Surgical picked up [£165m](https://sifted.eu/articles/cmr-surgical-raise-2023) in September last year, Switzerland’s DistalMotion $150m in April 2023 and Italy’s Medical Microinstruments $110m in February this year.

There’s also been some buzz around next-gen diagnostic devices, as founders — including [Spotify’s Daniel Ek](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-eks-body-scanning-neko-health-is-expanding-to-the-uk-news) with his body scanning startup Neko Health — look to tap into the trend of more people using wellbeing and fitness devices like Apple Watches and Oura rings.

But which non-portfolio medtech startups are investors keeping a close eye on? To find out, Sifted spoke to VCs at 415 Capital, Sofinnova Partners, MIG Capital and SHS Capital.

### **Linus Rieder, principal at 415 Capital**

![Image 1](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/23145641/Linus-final-Kopie-scaled-e1724421412663.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)

#### **Medical Microinstruments (MMI) – Italy**

MMI is building surgical robots to help with micro-surgery. Its robotics platform can be used in reconstructive surgery, plastic surgery and head-neck surgery. The startup is looking to solve key issues in microsurgery like the effects of surgeon tremor and reduces the need for microsurgery training.

#### **Gradient Denervation Technologies — France**

Gradient Denervation Technologies is developing a device for treating heart failure patients with associated pulmonary hypertension. As many as [half of heart failure patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199161/) around the world have elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, which is shown to lead to an increased risk of mortality and hospitalisation. There are no approved drug or device therapies for this group of pulmonary hypertension patients. By using minimally invasive ultrasound to treat hyperactive nerves in the pulmonary arteries, however, the startup’s technology has the potential to treat and help tens of thousands of patients each year.

#### **CorWave — France**

CorWave's left ventricular assist device (LVAD) mimics the natural heart's function to treat patients with advanced heart failure. This technology enables the device to replicate the heart pulses, reducing the mechanical damage to blood cells common with current LVADs.

### **Anne Osdoit, partner at Sofinnova Partners**

#### **Ganymed Robotics — France** 

Ganymed is working on a robotics platform to assist surgeons with implant placement during knee replacement surgery. The Paris-based company's approach uses computer vision and artificial intelligence to perceive, and extract knowledge from, the surgical environment in a non-invasive manner, removing imaging and registration steps that add time and complexity to knee surgery.

#### **Gleamer — France**

Gleamer is developing AI tools to enhance image interpretation for radiologists. The startup’s main product helps clinicians identify bone trauma at the point of care. Gleamer has achieved multiple regulatory approvals and successfully commercially deployed in both the US and EU.

#### **Salvia BioElectronics — The Netherlands** 

Salvia BioElectronics is developing drug-free neuromodulation therapies — which refers to a group of medical procedures that look to change brain activity by stimulating nerves — for migraines. Salvia's paper-thin implant is designed to be placed under the forehead to reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks by delivering gentle electrical pulses to the nerves associated with the condition. The company is currently in the clinical stage, having received the Breakthrough Device Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which facilitates expedited market access for devices that treat life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating conditions.

### **Fei Tian, principal at MIG Capital**

![Image 3](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/23150100/image001-4-scaled-e1724421677917.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)

#### **Artidis — Switzerland**

Artidis is developing imaging tools for cancer diagnostics. It combines a nanotechnology device which analyses tissue with a digital data platform to measure the physical characteristics of both tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment. After determining if a tumour is benign or malignant, Artidis’ technology identifies if it will spread to other sites and can help inform chemotherapy and immunotherapy permeability and treatment response.

#### **CoreMedic — Switzerland** 

CoreMedic has developed an implant which treats the heart condition mitral valve regurgitation (MR). The CoreMedic implant can replace ruptured mitral — a part of the heart — in a minimally invasive procedure that is physiological and reproducible, promising long-term clinical benefits.

### **Cornelius Maas, partner at SHS Capital**

![Image 4](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/27174537/Dr.-Cornelius-Maas_SHS_38_retouched-scaled-e1724421707488.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)

#### **Vitestro — The Netherlands**

Vitestro is developing an autonomous blood drawing device. This innovative device combines robotics and AI to perform blood drawing more efficiently and safely. Over the past year, Vitestro has made significant strides in clinical trials and secured an additional €20m in funding in April. Vitestro’s tool could mean less burden for patients, less work for the medical staff and consequently reduce costs for the healthcare system.

#### **Saphenus — Austria**

Saphenus is developing sensory feedback systems for prosthetics. Their key product, the Suralis system, provides users of lower-limb prosthetics with the sensation of foot contact, significantly improving balance and gait. Recently, Saphenus received FDA approval with their Suralis systema and received reimbursement status with key German medical insurers.

#### **Bluedrop Medical — Ireland**

Bluedrop Medical is developing a medical device to monitor foot health and prevent diabetic foot ulcers. It looks like a weighing scale and aims to enable early detection of foot ulcers, which can lead to amputation. Bluedrop Medical is a good example of how remote monitoring can replace doctor visits while preventing serious disease progression, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

Riding the Wegovy wave: The startups shifting focus to GLP-1s to tap the $150bn weight loss drug market
=======================================================================================================

Founders and investors see massive potential in the new drug class — but funding is yet to flood startups in the sector
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Kai Nicol-Schwarz](https://sifted.eu/author/kai-nicol-schwarz/)

7 min read

![Image 55](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/07164512/Screenshot-2023-09-07-at-16.45.04.png?auto=format&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Cedges%2Centropy&ar=3%3A1&w=3840&q=75)

The meteoric rise of a new class of weight loss drugs over the past two years, known as GLP-1s, has seen a new name take the title of Europe’s most valuable company, helped a country dodge a recession and hit grocery sales in the US.

The valuations of the companies that make this so-called “miracle” class of drugs — which includes Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and US rival Eli Lilly (maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) — have [soared](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/04/the-battle-over-the-trillion-dollar-weight-loss-bonanza) as investors bet big on a medication projected by some to hit [$150bn in sales](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/weight-loss-drug-forecasts-jump-150-billion-supply-grows-2024-05-28/) by the early 2030s.

The potential of the market has not been lost on founders.

It’s a “huge” opportunity, says Kai Eberhardt, the founder and CEO of Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform which operates in the UK, France and Germany, alongside its home market. It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.

“For us \[GLP-1 drugs\] are already a strong growth driver,” he says. “The newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.”

While treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva’s overall business — Eberhardt says it’s growing total patient and revenue numbers by “double digit” percentage points year-on-year — the meds could become the startup’s “largest” growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.

### **Riding the wave**

Oviva’s not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity — many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.

In the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart’s CEO, [food sales have fallen](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-04/walmart-says-ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-causing-slight-pullback-by-shoppers?sref=MTy2GeXk) as the [one in eight adults](http://cnbc.com/2024/05/14/healthy-returns-1-in-8-adults-have-taken-glp-1s-like-ozempic-survey.html) in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe’s [most valuable company,](https://www.ft.com/content/19357584-62e0-452f-a06f-7cda1d8cd0e3) propping up [Denmark’s GDP](https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/economics/article/wegovy-proves-to-be-wonder-drug-for-danish-economy-rgd6lqjh5) in the process.

All of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have [convinced them to get out their chequebook](https://sifted.eu/articles/weight-loss-drug-mania-reaches-europe-denmarks-embla-raises-10m): Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a [€10m Series A](https://sifted.eu/articles/weight-loss-drug-mania-reaches-europe-denmarks-embla-raises-10m) in August 2023 a year on from a €3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised €3.1m last summer.

Many startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn’t start life offering them — largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.

UK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a [“men’s health”](https://sifted.eu/articles/numan-mens-health-stigma) brand, but has recently changed that. The company’s website uses images of men _and_ women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.

Yazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.

Meurling tells Sifted it had hit €14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It’s now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.

Other startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men’s sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.

“\[GLP-1 meds\] are a game changer,” says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be “strange” if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn’t looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.

While GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the “hype” surrounding the drug class has “opened doors” for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler — adding that the startup managed to raise its €400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It’s now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it’ll look to target US employers — who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.

### **Kinks in the supply chain**

There are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector — not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.

Some of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate’s $100m in 2021 and Form Health’s $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than €10m in a single round.

Investors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics — [Manual was still selling past the deadline.](https://sifted.eu/articles/healthtech-manual-selling-ozempic-beyond-uk-government-deadline)

If a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.

“As there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.”

### **Who’ll stump up the cash?**

There’s also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.

While Numan’s head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the “success of private sector companies offering GLP-1 \[drugs\] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS”, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won’t be enough to hit real scale.

“US investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts \[selling to whole organisations like health insurers\],” says Syhler. “This means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care — where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.”

In Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.

In the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.

Oviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS — but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it’s in “mature dialogues with several health systems”.

“It is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,” says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that [don’t always want to work with startups.](https://sifted.eu/articles/ai-healthcare-nhs-startup) Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.

Whether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen — but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. “I've never been an investor in a company that’s got so much attention — in a space that’s got so much attention,” says Arnardottir.

Flo Health has recently hit a $1bn valuation, making it Europe's first femtech unicorn. However, the fact that it was founded by an all-male team has sparked extensive debate in the tech and medical communities. Critics argue it highlights systemic gender biases in funding, while others say it proves the money-making potential in women's health, thus possibly opening doors for more investments in the sector.

Flo themselves note over half their employees are women, hinting at a more balanced leadership pipeline.

On Wednesday UK-based period tracking app Flo Health announced it had raised $200m — pushing its valuation beyond $1bn and making it Europe’s first femtech unicorn.

It turned out to be a very [buzzy story](https://email.sifted.eu/e3t/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mfCN04/VWd7S56fts6_W5MRMLq4ZH5wFW6YVQGc5jbfNKN5j5FQx3qgyTW7lCdLW6lZ3nfW33mt2d9fhswPW6cbbn42Gk2LbW8scjQ_6cnrxDW1clnhC2ShJQHVccVZ53gzXq5W4wQdZG67pwTSW2-JWpF92k-_3W7wvb489fJTrcW8Yc8WL2J2BxbVsVjMQ2l0S96W8kJSgJ8PlPBnW3C2JWZ7p72hNW6XXzRB8xLSLCW1Qsggq5_4Rb1W2TDtZV1qFp0NW8cjBvC794-SqW6CX8JV3JLP8SW3PhCFV1MtGl5N2XnVkqP0RWYVJ5lGy5VWWL_W95gKqH7mC7fGN8ZGCJCNps2DW3hhNk75-4tsCW6zlG0Z5p-vJhf88-NBl04): as people were quick to point out online, Flo also became Europe’s first women’s health unicorn _with an all-male founding team_ — a detail which sparked a backlash online.

“A company founded by men, led by men and funded by men became the first WOMEN'S health app to achieve unicorn status. If this doesn't show you everything that's wrong with the ecosystem, I don't know what will,” Anna-Sophie Hartvigsen, cofounder of investment learning app and community for women Female Invest, wrote [in a viral LinkedIn post](https://email.sifted.eu/e3t/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mfCN04/VWd7S56fts6_W5MRMLq4ZH5wFW6YVQGc5jbfNKN5j5FPl5bRGYW50kH_H6lZ3l8W4LGN588Q_4ZsW8wQ5KR6wTrX5W7yCq0w85CZG9W3vhYPj1slFYHN7B_Ncv_0lQFW5X-v0Q51XxGqW6MPX5p5pwYL9W1D4cXM5h1_MGW7W96ly7MtK-lW381wDG8L1J_PW2_GGrC99Nz87N7QYN_6c-6xhVbl3C8715Xk_MpwjzGcNvlcW3dD_dz5jH-v9W49__9X8Dl27zN6pG5cpR5Y8-W1P9wsl5X0QKfW7pKmFX4zN8c0Vvdxk071SZSSW3r-vWY72Kwv1W4rpnn35WQhWCW6mSf3c1Z9ZHfVtbKWF8SQ18NW74YWXR83cqHnW4jGq_N5RH-nDW2tGsJ33h0LCbW4zWMDM5z_R9CW2_sJfz188vZJW4qtZ453fg7NWW5LGdY_77tcmZW3F37Zc24XYyMf7-GWgH04), citing stats on the [lack of funding for female founders](https://email.sifted.eu/e3t/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mfCN04/VWd7S56fts6_W5MRMLq4ZH5wFW6YVQGc5jbfNKN5j5FQx3qgyTW7lCdLW6lZ3npVZ6rdY6xdTkKW5dqdCC3CpbHkW6hmw1f8YJJx8W2h-hSY5hYtf0W3HtTS183-N4gN7hMSn23njKxW18dFQG93dPz7N7_1xPQZKQbwW3tfkLc5rhD5vW3kmy8562PSf5VVJMdj80mh0VW2xYdCC11lSqMW4Bjfsz1z2prLW17bbCc8ffd1CW548x4q6l5pqWN1H52hZxSG9WW2_7TbZ8zJD61W1spH161xBM0CW3YV1dC5_NGBBW3_BcXt8sdfLPW8vx_yh1pZ3FtW2rLJgd7p8_CsW7d4VW93Y2nkzW5PBwYY4SptZgf3zzZbM04). “I’m not saying it’s bad that a femtech company is doing well,” she later added in the comments. “I’m saying it’s bad that only men are able to succeed in this space.”

Some founders in the comments underneath Hartvigsen's post said that they’ve struggled with fundraising as a woman; there was also a debate in a private WhatsApp group seen by Sifted about whether female founders should add a token male founder to their team in an effort to increase their chances of getting cheques. Someone in that group added that we won’t fix the trend of men funding men until there are more female investors.

But others didn’t see it that way.

“This achievement should actually be celebrated. As a women's health investor that has invested in 7+ women's health companies, we are yet to see any of them scale,” Deepali Nangia, a partner at Speedinvest, wrote in response to Hartvigsen’s LinkedIn post. “Flo's achievement is a very strong signal to the market that \[direct to consumer\] women's health is monetizable in Europe and that there is money to be made here; this is what investors need to see so more money flows into women's health companies. Not to say that the challenges faced by women in pitching are any less, but we must celebrate all wins that lead to more capital deployed into this sector,” she argued.

Nangia added that she wasn’t doubting there’s a problem, “but every win should not be turned around to a problem… Many people have been working on solving for this problem, which includes many women of course but also men.”

Another commenter added: “If anything, let this be a door for more investors to look closely at the female health industry and invest their money there? Could this be an example of men allies? If it had to be a company founded and led by men, well thank you very much for opening the door, now let the rest go through.”

Priya Oberoi, partner at women’s health-focused VC Goddess Gaia Ventures, added: “Flo reaching series C \[unicorn\] status with 60 mln active users is a win for #womenshealth - helping to close that 131 year gender health gap and getting products and services out there to improve the lives of women.”

""We firmly believe that women's health has been critically overlooked, undervalued and underfunded for far too long,"" Flo said in a statement to Sifted. ""Our sincere hope is that Flo’s funding will inspire more investors to recognise the immense potential in this space."" The company added: ""We're proud to say that more than half (56%) of Flo's employees are women, including our leadership team.""

It’s an important debate, and, readers, I’m curious to hear your thoughts: why aren’t there more female-founded femtech unicorns? Is it a problem that the first European femtech unicorn is founded by men, if the product helps women? Does it open doors for female founders in the space, or actually keep them shut?

A recent cohort study from the UK delves into the link between maternal angiomas and increased rates of infantile hemangioma (IH) and port-wine stains (PWS) in children. The research analyzed over 639,000 mother-child pairs, revealing that children of mothers with angiomas were 60% more likely to develop IH, while those of mothers with PWS were nearly 20 times more likely to have PWS themselves. However, cross-association (IH with maternal PWS and PWS with maternal angioma) was not observed, indicating specific hereditary pathways. 

This data underscores the importance of genetic counseling for expecting mothers with angioma or PWS histories.

Abstract
--------

The two most prevalent childhood vascular abnormalities are infantile hemangioma (IH) and port-wine stain (PWS). They become apparent shortly after birth but have distinct pathophysiology and clinical manifestations. The goal of this study was to determine if mother’s history of angioma or PWS is associated with these vascular abnormalities. We evaluated an UK anonymized electronic medical records database with medical records that were linked between children and their mothers. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between maternal factors and the time of onset of either IH or PWS in children. Between 2004 and 2021, 639,085 children were linked to their mom’s medical data with a total of 4,270,773 person-years of follow up. Children born to mothers with an angioma as compared to a mother without an angioma were more than 60% more likely to have an IH (HR: 1.64 \[1.07, 2.52\]). Children born to mothers with a PWS as compared to children born to mothers without a PWS were nearly 20 times more likely to have a PWS (18.95 \[4.71,76.26\]). Mothers with angiomas were not more likely to have children with PWS and mothers with PWS were not more likely to have children with IH. The effect estimates were minimally changed after adjustment. We demonstrated that children born to mothers with angiomas or PWS were at increased risk of IH or PWS, respectively.

Recent research published in the European Respiratory Journal explores the management of latent tuberculosis infections (LTBI) in migrants, emphasizing primary care's cost-effectiveness without compromising safety. The study compared treatment in primary versus secondary care settings, finding similar completion rates but at a lower cost in primary care. However, acceptance was lower in primary care (65.2% vs 94.2%).

Is your practice considering adopting cost-effective approaches for managing LTBI? Share your thoughts and experiences in the comments below!

Your goal is to create posts that begin with a strong, specific, attention-grabbing headline relevant to the medical community. The content should be concise, informative, and focused on topics such as new research findings, emerging medical technologies, or best practices in patient care. Include a subtle call to action that encourages doctors to engage with the content, whether by commenting, sharing their experiences, or exploring additional resources. The tone should be professional yet natural and approachable, and you should incorporate relevant visuals and hashtags to increase the post’s reach and credibility within the medical field.

Abstract
--------

**Background** Control of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a priority in the World Health Organization strategy to eliminate tuberculosis (TB). Many high-income low TB incidence countries have prioritised LTBI screening and treatment in recent migrants. We tested whether a novel model of care, based entirely within primary care, was effective and safe as compared to secondary care.

**Methods** This was a pragmatic cluster-randomised, parallel group, superiority trial conducted in 34 general practices in London, UK, comparing LTBI treatment in recent migrants in primary care to secondary care. The primary outcome was treatment completion, defined as taking at least 90% of antibiotic doses. Secondary outcomes included treatment acceptance, adherence, adverse effects, patient satisfaction, TB-incidence and a cost-effectiveness analysis. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ([NCT03069807](https://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/external-ref?link_type=CLINTRIALGOV&access_num=NCT03069807&atom=%2Ferj%2Fearly%2F2024%2F08%2F08%2F13993003.01733-2023.atom)). Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

**Results** Between September 2016 and May 2019, 362 recent migrants with LTBI were offered treatment and 276 accepted. Treatment completion was similar in primary and secondary care (82·6% _versus_ 86·0%, aOR:0·64, 95%CI:0·31–1·29). There was no difference in drug induced liver injury (DILI) between primary and secondary care (0·7% _versus_ 2·3%, aOR:0·29, 95%CI:0·03–2·84). Treatment acceptance was lower in primary care (65·2% (146/224) _versus_ 94.2% (130/138), aOR:0·10, 95%CI:0·03–0·31). The estimated cost per patient completing treatment was lower in primary care, with an incremental saving of £315. 27(£313.47-£317.07).

**Conclusions** The treatment of LTBI in recent migrants within primary care does not result in higher rates of treatment completion but is safe and costs less when compared to secondary care.

Alternate Insomnia Therapy Has Good Showing
===========================================

**TOPLINE:** 
-------------

Brief nurse-delivered sleep restriction therapy is efficacious, safe, and likely cost-effective for treating insomnia disorder in primary care.

**METHODOLOGY:** 
-----------------

*   Investigators conducted an open-label, randomised controlled trial among adult patients with insomnia disorder from NHS general practices in England (the [HABIT trial](https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN42499563)).
*   A total of 642 patients were randomised to two groups:
    *   Nurse-delivered behavioural therapy intervention: Two in-person and two telephone sessions, plus support to follow a prescribed sleep schedule aimed at restricting and standardising time in bed, plus a sleep hygiene leaflet.
    *   Control: Sleep hygiene leaflet only.
*   The main outcome was the self-reported insomnia severity on the Insomnia Severity Index (range, 0-28) at 6 months.

**TAKEAWAY:** 
--------------

*   At 6 months, the mean Insomnia Severity Index score was 10.9 in the sleep restriction therapy group vs 13.9 in the control group (estimated adjusted mean difference, –3.05; _P_ < .001).
*   Scores were also lower with the intervention at 3 months (10.9 vs 14.8; _P_ < .001) and at 12 months (10.4 vs 13.5; _P_ < .001).
*   Sleep restriction therapy was superior to control with respect to secondary outcomes too: self-reported sleep, mental health–related quality of life, depressive symptoms, work productivity impairment, and sleep-related quality of life.
*   Sixteen patients, evenly split between groups, experienced serious adverse events; none were deemed related to trial interventions.
*   Sleep restriction therapy had an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained of £2075.71.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""The vast majority of people with insomnia in the \[United Kingdom\] cannot access the first-line treatment (cognitive behavioural therapy),"" the authors wrote. ""Our trial shows that nurses can be trained to deliver a focused and manualised behavioural insomnia treatment, leading to patient benefit, and without safety concerns. Moreover, the intervention is very likely to be cost-effective. Nurse-delivered \[sleep restriction therapy\] could therefore become part of primary care management of insomnia,"" they concluded.

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study was led by Simon D. Kyle, PhD, MA, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK, and was [published online](https://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/hta/RJYT4275#/abstract) in _Health Technology Assessment_.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

Limitations included a predominantly White and better-educated trial population, discontinuations due to the perceived challenging nature of the intervention, and the possibility that some participants had other, undiagnosed sleep disorders.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The study was funded by the National Institute of Health and Care Research. Two authors disclosed affiliations with Big Health Ltd, which manufactures a digital sleep improvement programme.

2024-08-29 09:00:00,2024-08-31 05:13:37,"### Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections: Antibiotic Use and Resistance Challenges in Women

A recent study published in the _British Journal of General Practice_ highlights the prevalence and resistance patterns in women suffering from recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in Wales. The cross-sectional study reveals that 6% of women suffer from rUTIs and roughly 1.7% are prescribed prophylactic antibiotics. However, a significant portion of these women exhibit bacterial resistance, especially to commonly used antibiotics like trimethoprim and amoxicillin. The increased resistance underscores the need for frequent urine cultures to better inform antibiotic prescriptions and help combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

For doctors, this study reinforces the importance of aligning real-world practices with guidelines by encouraging urine cultures before initiating prophylactic antibiotics. Let's explore practical strategies and discuss how these insights could optimize patient care in your practice.

Abstract
--------

**Background** Despite the considerable morbidity caused by recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs), and the wider personal and public health implications from frequent antibiotic use, few studies adequately describe the prevalence and characteristics of women with rUTIs or those who use prophylactic antibiotics.

**Aim** To describe the prevalence, characteristics, and urine profiles of women with rUTIs with and without prophylactic antibiotic use in Welsh primary care.

**Design and setting** This was a retrospective cross-sectional study in Welsh general practice using the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank.

**Method** The characteristics of women aged ≥18 years with rUTIs or using prophylactic antibiotics from 2010 to 2020, and associated urine culture results from 2015 to 2020, are described.

**Results** In total, 6.0% (_n_ = 92 213/_N_ = 1 547 919) had rUTIs, and 1.7% (_n_ = 26 862/_N_ = 1 547 919) were prescribed prophylactic antibiotics with the rates increasing after 57 years of age. Only 49.0% (_n_ =13 149/_N_ = 26 862) of users of prophylactic antibiotics met the definition of rUTIs before initiation. The study found that 80.8% (_n_ = 44 947/_N_ = 55 652) of women with rUTIs had a urine culture result in the preceding 12 months with high rates of resistance to trimethoprim and amoxicillin. Of women taking prophylactic antibiotics, 64.2% (_n_ = 9926/_N_ = 15 455) had a urine culture result before initiation and 18.5% (_n_ = 320/_N_ = 1730) of women prescribed trimethoprim had resistance to it on the antecedent sample.

**Conclusion** A substantial proportion of women had rUTIs or incident prophylactic antibiotic use. However, 64.2% (_n_ = 9926/_N_ = 15 455) of women had urine cultured before starting prophylaxis. There was a high proportion of cultured bacteria resistant to two antibiotics used for rUTI prevention and evidence of resistance to the prescribed antibiotic. More frequent urine cultures for rUTI diagnosis and before prophylactic antibiotic initiation could better inform antibiotic choices.

Introduction
------------

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are common, and a proportion experience recurrent UTIs (rUTIs), defined as ≥2 UTIs in 6 months, or ≥3 in 12 months.1–3 rUTIs are a significant cause of morbidity and health service use.1,4,5 Estimates of the prevalence of rUTIs range from 3% to 44% of women, depending on the definition used and age or nationality studied.6–8 Women with rUTIs have frequent antibiotic exposure because of treatment for acute UTIs and potential long-term prophylaxis. Antibiotic exposure is a major driver of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and antibiotic exposure for UTIs increases resistance within 2 months and persists for 12 months.[9](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-9),[10](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-10) Resistant UTIs have a greater impact on patients and are more costly to treat than susceptible infections.[11](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-11),[12](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-12)

Despite the considerable morbidity caused by rUTIs, and the wider personal and public health implications from frequent antibiotic use, few studies adequately describe the prevalence and characteristics of women with rUTIs. Furthermore, it is unclear how well clinical practice aligns with current guidelines recommending urine culture for rUTI diagnosis.[1](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-1) Understanding real-world practice related to diagnosing and treating rUTIs, a common condition seen and managed in primary care, is an important step towards improving patient care.

This study aimed to comprehensively describe the prevalence, characteristics, urine testing, and susceptibility profiles of women with rUTIs in Wales to understand current clinical practice and alignment with guidelines.

Little is known about the prevalence, characteristics, urine testing, or the use of prophylactic antibiotics among women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs). This study found that 6.0% (_n_ = 92 213/_N_ = 1 547 919) of women had evidence of rUTIs in Wales from 2010 to 2020, and, from 2015–2020, 80.8% (_n_ = 44 947/_N_ = 55 652) had a urine culture result in the preceding 12 months. In total, 1.7% (_n_ = 26 862/_N_ = 1 547 919) of women used prophylactic antibiotics during the study period and, between 2015–2020, 64.2% (_n_ = 9926/_N_ = 15 455) had a urine culture result before starting prophylaxis, and of these 8.3% (_n_ = 410/_N_ = 4920) were resistant to the prescribed antibiotic. More frequent urine cultures in the workup of rUTI diagnosis and prophylactic antibiotic initiation could better inform antibiotic choice.

The Improving Prophylactic Antibiotic use for Recurrent urinary Tract infection (IMPART) patient and public team were involved in the design of this study.

### Population

Two cohorts were created. Cohort 1 included women who met the clinical definition of rUTIs (clinical cohort). Cohort 2 included women prescribed prophylactic antibiotics consistent with rUTI prevention (prophylaxis cohort; for definitions, see below). Eligibility criteria for the two cohorts are described in [Box 1](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#T2).

### Case ascertainment

#### Definition of recurrent UTIs

In the current study, rUTIs were defined as ≥2 acute UTIs within 6 months, or ≥3 within 12 months.1 How acute UTIs were defined is shown in [Box 2](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#T3). Consultations and hospital admissions for acute UTIs were identified using Read and ICD-10 code lists (Supplementary Boxes S2–S4). More than one acute UTI within a 28-day period was considered a repeat consultation for the same episode. The date of the first consultation was recorded as the acute UTI date (Supplementary Figure S1). For hospital-diagnosed UTIs, the start date of the UTI was the first date of an episode containing a UTI ICD-10 code and the end date was its final date. The first time a woman met the definition of rUTI was used as the date of rUTI diagnosis.

| 4\. Hospital-diagnosed, microbiologically confirmed, and treated UTI | • No | • No | • Yes | • ConfirmedUTI | • Within 7 days. Earliest code = date of UTI |

Box 2.

Definitions of acute UTIsa

#### Definition of prophylactic antibiotics

Prophylactic antibiotic use was defined as ≥3 consecutive prescriptions for the same UTI-specific antibiotic (trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, or cefalexin) with 21–56 days between prescriptions (Supplementary Box S5 and Supplementary Figure S2). This approach was required as WLGP data include prescribing data only (not dispensing) without data on the quantity of tablets prescribed. Women who used prophylactic antibiotics in the preceding 12 months were excluded to identify new users and ascertain urine culture results before initiation.

#### Comorbidity identification

Relevant comorbidities that either increase the risk of UTIs or potentially influence antibiotic prescribing were identified using Read codes and/or ICD-10 codes in the WLGP and PEDW data sources, respectively. To define these, the authors looked back from the date of cohort entry. The length of lookback was specific to the condition and further details are included in Supplementary Box S6.

#### Urine microbiology

Reported urine culture results were identified using code lists for urine tests in the WRRS (Supplementary Box S7). Analyses of urine specimens were restricted to 2015–2020 as there was a marked increase in NHS Wales laboratories submitting urine data from 2015.[23](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-23) Urine culture results reported on the same day with the same result were regarded as duplicates. Urine microbiology results were categorised using a methodology based on the Public Health Wales Microbiology Division’s standard operating procedure using organism(s) cultured and white blood cell count (Supplementary Box S8).[24](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-24) Antibiotic susceptibility was categorised using the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing guidelines 2019, where intermediate is described as susceptible at increased exposure.[25](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-25)

In the study, all reported urine culture results in the 12 months before diagnosis (clinical cohort) and 18 months before prophylactic antibiotic initiation (prophylactic cohort) and all urine culture results within 7 days of an acute UTI were analysed to define the number of women with microbiologically confirmed rUTIs. The rationale for using 18 months before study entry for the prophylactic cohort was to account for potential delays between rUTI diagnosis and investigation or referral before initiating antibiotics.

### Statistical analysis

Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were summarised using counts and percentages for categorical variables and means (with standard deviation) or medians (with interquartile range \[IQR\]) for continuous variables. Rates were calculated according to 10-year age bands using all women in SAIL aged ≥18 years and their person-time over the study period (2010–2020) as the denominator.

For women in both cohorts, the number of urine cultures before cohort entry, organisms cultured, and antibiotic susceptibility with subgroup analyses for _Escherichia coli_ and coliforms are reported. The study also explored whether the proportions of urine cultures tested for susceptibility and the proportion that were resistant changed over the study period in view of changing incident prophylactic antibiotic use in the prophylaxis cohort.

For women in the prophylaxis cohort, antibiotic type and dose are also reported and how many met the definition of rUTIs was calculated. For those who did, time between meeting the rUTI definition and starting prophylactic antibiotics was calculated. Sensitivity analyses were conducted first restricting prophylactic antibiotic use to women on a consistent dose of antibiotics over consecutive prescriptions and secondly the definition used in this study for acute UTIs was adjusted to describe the proportion of women with rUTIs before starting prophylaxis to assess their impact on the estimates. Finally, how many women had a urine culture reported before initiating prophylactic antibiotics was estimated and the most recent result before initiation was used to ascertain their prophylactic antibiotic susceptibility.

Analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.3.26 The SAIL Databank Information Governance Review Panel approved the study. For analyses where counts are small, counts are rounded to the nearest 10 for the purposes of disclosure control and privacy protection. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist to guide reporting was used.[27](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-27)

Results
-------

In total, 92 213 women (6.0% of women aged ≥18 years between 2010 and 2020) who met the clinical definition of rUTIs were identified and were entered into the clinical cohort ([Figure 1](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#F1)), _N_ = 1 547 919. Median age was 60.0 years (IQR 38.0–76.0).

The rate of women with rUTIs followed a ‘J’ shaped pattern rising with increasing age ([Figure 2](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#F2)).

The study identified 26 862 women (1.7%) with prescriptions for prophylactic antibiotics who formed the prophylaxis cohort ([Figure 1](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#F1)), _N_ = 1 547 919. Median age was 70.6 years (IQR 55.1–81.6). In all, 17 803 were included in both cohorts.

Prophylactic antibiotic initiation increased initially until 2012 before declining from 2013 (Supplementary Figure S3). Trimethoprim and cefalexin use declined with time, and nitrofurantoin use increased. The most used prophylactic antibiotic was trimethoprim (Supplementary Figure S4). A small proportion (<1.0%) of women appeared to be using multiple antibiotics concurrently. Most women were taking a consistent dose of the prophylactic antibiotic across the consecutive prescriptions (77.8%, _n_ = 20 892/_N_ = 26 862). The most prescribed dosages for trimethoprim were 100 mg and 200 mg, for nitrofurantoin were 50 mg or 100 mg, and for cefalexin were 250 mg and 500 mg.

The two cohorts were similar in terms of ethnic group and deprivation ([Table 1](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#T4)). Most women with rUTIs were fit or had mild frailty according to the electronic frailty index, whereas for prophylactic antibiotic users all levels of frailty were higher ([Table 1](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#T4)).[28](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-28),[29](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-29)

Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of women with recurrent UTIs and prophylactic antibiotic users

### Clinical cohort

When the clinical cohort was restricted to those with rUTIs between 2015 and 2020, the cohort reduced to 55 652 women and 125 971 urine culture results. Of these 55 652, 44 947 (80.8%) women had a urine culture reported in the preceding 12 months, and, of these, 41.1% (_n_ = 18 475/_N_ = 44 947) had ≥3 samples reported. Of all urine cultures reported, 28.1% (_N_ = 125 971) showed microbiological evidence of a UTI (Supplementary Figure S5) with _E. coli_ the most cultured uropathogen (76.8% _n_ = 41 987/_N_ = 54 667) (Supplementary Figure S6). Based on urine culture results within 7 days of an acute UTI, 5.1% (_n_ = 2866) had microbiologically confirmed rUTIs (that is, all UTIs contributing to the rUTI diagnosis were microbiologically confirmed).

Antibiotic susceptibility testing was low (under 40%) for most antibiotics except trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, and amoxicillin. Trimethoprim and amoxicillin had high rates of resistance ([Table 2](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#T5)).

### Prophylaxis cohort

In the prophylaxis cohort, 49.0% (_n_ = 13 149/_N_ = 26 862) of women met the definition of rUTIs in the preceding 18 months. Of these, 39.1% (_n_ = 5139/_N_ = 13 149) started prophylactic antibiotics within 3 months of meeting the rUTI definition (Supplementary Figure S7).

When restricted to incident prophylactic antibiotic users between 2015 and 2020, the cohort reduced to 15 455 women and 53 988 urine culture results. Of these, 64.2% (_n_ = 9926/_N_ = 15 455) had ≥1 urine culture reported in the preceding 18 months and, of these, 77.0% (_n_ = 7641/_N_ = 9926) had ≥3 samples reported. Of reported urine cultures, 32.2% (_n_ = 17 367/_N_ = 53 988) were microbiologically confirmed UTIs, _E.coli_ was the predominant organism (75.7%, _n_ = 19 669/_N_ = 25 984) cultured and 42.8% (_n_ = 6611/_N_ = 15 455) had at least one microbiologically confirmed UTI before starting prophylactic antibiotics (Supplementary Figures S8 and S9). Of women taking prophylactic antibiotics between 2015 and 2020, 49.8% (_n_ = 7695/_N_ = 15 455) had clinical rUTIs before initiation and, of these, 6.1% (_n_ = 472/_N_ = 7695) had microbiologically confirmed rUTIs. Like the clinical cohort, antibiotic susceptibility for trimethoprim and amoxicillin showed high rates of resistance ([Table 2](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#T5)). However, the proportions of urine cultures growing any organism with evidence of resistance to trimethoprim or amoxicillin decreased over the study period (Supplementary Figure S10).

Based on the most recent urine culture that cultured an organism before initiating antibiotic prophylaxis, there were 4983 culture results. In women taking either trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, or cefalexin (_n_ = 4920), 8.3% (_n_ = 410/_N_ = 4920) had evidence of resistance to that antibiotic (Supplementary Table S1). This was highest in those taking trimethoprim (18.5%, _n_ = 320/_N_ = 1730), with a downward trend over the study period (Supplementary Figure S11). Resistance was lower for those taking nitrofurantoin (which was consistent over the study period) and cefalexin (trend not shown because of small numbers) (Supplementary Figure S11 and Supplementary Table S1). Resistance to these three prophylactic antibiotics, irrespective of which antibiotic was prescribed (including those taking multiple antibiotics), was 41.5% (_n_ = 2070/_N_ = 4983) for trimethoprim, 6.4% (_n_ = 320/_N_ = 4983) for nitrofurantoin, and 3.0% (_n_ = 150/_N_ = 4983) for cefalexin.

Sensitivity analyses only defining prophylactic antibiotic use if the dose prescribed was consistent across consecutive prescriptions did not meaningfully affect the estimates (Supplementary Table S2). Changing the minimum time between acute UTIs and changing the definition of an acute UTI to include Read codes only did not meaningfully have an impact on the estimate of women with rUTIs before starting prophylaxis (Supplementary Table S3). Changing the acute UTI definition used to include only UTI-related antibiotics did increase the proportion of women with rUTIs before starting prophylaxis to 74.3% (_n_ = 19 970/_N_ = 26 862).

Discussion
----------

### Summary

This is the first population-based study, to the authors’ knowledge, to describe the prevalence of rUTIs, prophylactic antibiotic use, and associated microbiology in women in the UK. The current study found that, of women registered with a SAIL data-providing general practice in Wales between 2010 and 2020, 6.0% had rUTIs, and 1.7% were prescribed prophylactic antibiotics with the proportions rising sharply around 58–67 years of age. Nearly half of users of prophylactic antibiotics met the rUTI definition in the 18 months before initiation, and initiation of prophylactic antibiotics decreased over the study period.

In total 80.8% of women with rUTIs had a urine culture reported in the 12 months before the diagnosis with high levels of resistance to trimethoprim and amoxicillin. Microbiological evidence of a UTI was present in 28.1% (_n_ = 35 404/_N_ = 125 971) of all reported urine cultures. Urine culture before initiating prophylactic antibiotics was reported in 64.2%. Of women prescribed trimethoprim, 18.5% had evidence of resistance to it before initiation. As part of rUTI diagnosis and before initiating prophylactic antibiotics, more frequent urine cultures could better inform antibiotic choice for prophylaxis and treatment.

### Strengths and limitations

This study used a large population-based sample to identify women with rUTIs and prescribed prophylactic antibiotics with linked urine microbiology including all urine culture within NHS Wales. The authors comprehensively reported urine microbiology results and resistance patterns. This study population was representative of women in the wider Welsh population and women with and without adequate lookback data had similar characteristics[14](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-14) (Supplementary Figures S12–S17). A conservative estimate of rUTI prevalence is likely both from using a 28-day window to avoid capturing UTI-relapse and not having data from out-of-hours general practice or hospital attendances not requiring admission. UTI-related codes were used to identify acute UTIs but if clinicians had used non-specific codes these UTIs would not be captured, again underestimating rUTI prevalence.

As a result of these potential limitations, when describing the proportion of women with rUTIs before prophylactic antibiotic initiation, the authors adjusted both the minimum time between UTIs and the definition of an acute UTI to include only UTI-specific Read codes (and potentially capture UTIs diagnosed in out-of-hours general practice or hospital attendances) or to include only antibiotics in sensitivity analyses. Changing the time between UTIs and defining an acute UTI based on UTI-specific Read codes had a minimal impact (Supplementary Table S3). Changing the definition of an acute UTI to include only antibiotics, increased the proportion with rUTIs but likely overestimated the true value (Supplementary Table S3).

The data used in the current study are primarily used for clinical practice, not research, with risks of coding errors, missing data, and misclassification. Misclassification of prophylactic antibiotics is possible where the women the authors defined as users of prophylactic antibiotics could have had three acute antibiotic courses. A variety of methods were used to reduce this risk, such as using a fixed timeframe between prescriptions and conducting a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the estimates. Finally, the diagnosis of UTIs is especially challenging in older, frailer women where symptoms can be less specific, and they may have asymptomatic bacteriuria and thus be misdiagnosed as having a UTI. This could potentially falsely elevate the prevalence of rUTIs; however, the authors used UTI-specific Read codes in addition to antibiotic prescriptions to try to mitigate for this.

### Comparison with existing literature

To the authors’ knowledge there is only one other study using population-based data describing women with rUTIs.[30](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-30) This US-based study identified women with incident rUTIs and found 60.9% of women had at least one urine culture over 12 months before diagnosis, lower than the proportion found in the current study. The current study cohort likely includes both incident and prevalent rUTIs as the authors did not stipulate a UTI-free period before rUTI cohort entry. Therefore urine culture, as per guidelines, might be more likely to occur in the current cohort in those with prevalent rUTIs. The US-based study also found a ‘J’ shaped curve for the incidence rate of rUTIs according to age. This likely relates to UTI risk factors such as sexual intercourse in early adulthood[5](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-5),[31](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-31) and hormonal changes of the menopause accounting for the increased rate at about 55 years of age (the typical age of menopause is between 45 and 55 years).[31](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-31)–[35](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-35) In terms of rUTI prevalence, the current results suggest the prevalence is higher than that of a survey conducted in 2015 that found a prevalence of 3%.[8](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-8) This is not surprising as certain populations such as frail women or those with cognitive impairment may not complete a survey, whereas they are more likely included in the current study’s cohort.

Prophylactic antibiotic use in the current study declined from 2013 to 2020. Overall antibiotic prescribing followed a similar pattern in both Wales and England, aligning with the UK Government’s strategy to reduce antibiotic use and combat increasing AMR.[36](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-36)–[38](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-38) Resistance in UTIs is an increasing problem and evidence of UTI resistance patterns in women with rUTIs is limited. The current study shows that trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin resistance in women with rUTIs are comparable with those reported in a 2018 and 2023 Public Health Wales report.[39](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-39),[40](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-40) This suggests resistance in women with rUTIs is not significantly higher than resistance patterns overall.

### Implications for practice

It could be clinically beneficial to encourage microbiological confirmation of rUTIs in primary care and before prophylactic antibiotic initiation in line with clinical guidelines.[5](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-5),[31](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-31) Women with rUTIs in the current study had high levels of resistance to trimethoprim and amoxicillin, which are two of the four prophylactic antibiotics recommended in the UK.[31](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-31) A low proportion of urine cultures reported susceptibility to cefalexin, and although resistance levels were relatively low they should be interpreted with caution because of likely selective testing. Despite low resistance levels, nitrofurantoin has limitations in chronic kidney disease and can result in lung and liver fibrosis with the risk increasing with age and duration of use.[41](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-41)–[43](https://bjgp.org/content/early/2024/08/19/BJGP.2024.0015.long#ref-43) The current study has also shown that 18.5% of women prescribed trimethoprim had evidence of resistance before initiation. These findings emphasise urine culture’s potential importance in informing prophylactic antibiotic choice. However, increasing urine culture has limitations owing to negative culture results, culturing a mixed growth of organisms, or the initiator, in primary or secondary care, not having access to all recent urine microbiology results.

In conclusion, this is the first population-based study on rUTIs and prophylactic antibiotic use in women including urine microbiology. The prevalence of rUTIs in women and the incident use of prophylactic antibiotics in Wales, although declining with time, was substantial especially in older women. Women with rUTIs had high levels of resistance to two of the four recommended prophylactic antibiotics, 64.2% had urine culture before starting prophylactic antibiotics, and a significant proportion had evidence of resistance to that antibiotic.

A new systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis released by BMJ dives deep into the comparative effectiveness of psychedelics and traditional antidepressants, such as escitalopram, for treating depressive symptoms. High-dose psilocybin stands out, showing a more significant impact than escitalopram 10 mg and 20 mg, suggesting potential for psychedelic treatment.🙌

However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of psilocybin, when blinding issues are addressed, is comparable to current antidepressants, with a standardised mean difference reported at a small effect size (0.31). These findings urge the medical community to approach psychedelic treatments with improved blinding methods for accurate efficacy evaluation.

Abstract
--------

**Objective** To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and acceptability of oral monotherapy using psychedelics and escitalopram in patients with depressive symptoms, considering the potential for overestimated effectiveness due to unsuccessful blinding.

**Design** Systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis.

**Data sources** Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrial.gov, and World Health Organization’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to 12 October 2023.

**Eligibility criteria for selecting studies** Randomised controlled trials on psychedelics or escitalopram in adults with depressive symptoms. Eligible randomised controlled trials of psychedelics (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (known as MDMA), lysergic acid diethylamide (known as LSD), psilocybin, or ayahuasca) required oral monotherapy with no concomitant use of antidepressants.

**Data extraction and synthesis** The primary outcome was change in depression, measured by the 17-item Hamilton depression rating scale. The secondary outcomes were all cause discontinuation and severe adverse events. Severe adverse events were those resulting in any of a list of negative health outcomes including, death, admission to hospital, significant or persistent incapacity, congenital birth defect or abnormality, and suicide attempt. Data were pooled using a random effects model within a Bayesian framework. To avoid estimation bias, placebo responses were distinguished between psychedelic and antidepressant trials.

**Results** Placebo response in psychedelic trials was lower than that in antidepression trials of escitalopram (mean difference −3.90 (95% credible interval −7.10 to −0.96)). Although most psychedelics were better than placebo in psychedelic trials, only high dose psilocybin was better than placebo in antidepression trials of escitalopram (mean difference 6.45 (3.19 to 9.41)). However, the effect size (standardised mean difference) of high dose psilocybin decreased from large (0.88) to small (0.31) when the reference arm changed from placebo response in the psychedelic trials to antidepressant trials. The relative effect of high dose psilocybin was larger than escitalopram at 10 mg (4.66 (95% credible interval 1.36 to 7.74)) and 20 mg (4.69 (1.64 to 7.54)). None of the interventions was associated with higher all cause discontinuation or severe adverse events than the placebo.

**Conclusions** Of the available psychedelic treatments for depressive symptoms, patients treated with high dose psilocybin showed better responses than those treated with placebo in the antidepressant trials, but the effect size was small.

**Systematic review registration** PROSPERO, CRD42023469014.

Introduction
------------

Common psychedelics belong to two classes: classic psychedelics, such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (known as LSD), and ayahuasca; and entactogens, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).[1](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-1) Several randomised controlled trials have shown efficacy of psychedelics for people with clinical depression.[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-2)[3](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-3) The proposed mechanism of its fast and persistent antidepressant effects is to promote structural and functional neuroplasticity through the activation of intracellular 5-HT2A receptors in the cortical neurons.[4](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-4) Additionally, the increased neuroplasticity was associated with psychedelic’s high affinity directly binding to brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor TrkB, indicating a dissociation between the hallucinogenic and plasticity promoting effects of psychedelics.[5](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-5) A meta-analysis published in 2023 reported that the standardised mean difference of psychedelics for depression reduction ranged from 1.37 to 3.12,[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-2) which are considered large effect sizes.[6](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-6) Notably, the standardised mean difference of antidepressant trials is approximately 0.3 (a small effect size).[7](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-7)[8](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-8)

Although modern randomised controlled trials involving psychedelics usually use a double blinded design, the subjective effects of these substances can compromise blinding.[9](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-9) Unsuccessful blinding may lead to differing placebo effects between the active and control groups, potentially introducing bias into the estimation of relative treatment effects.[10](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-10) Concerns have arisen regarding the overestimated effect sizes of psychedelics due to the issues of blinding and response expectancy.[9](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-9) Psychedelic treatment is usually administered with psychological support or psychotherapy, and thereby the isolated pharmacological effects of psychedelics remain to be determined.[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-2) Surprisingly, on 1 July 2023, Australia approved psilocybin for the treatment of depression[11](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-11); the first country to classify psychedelics as a medicine at a national level.

To date, only one double blind, head-to-head randomised controlled trial has directly compared a psychedelic drug (psilocybin) with an antidepressant drug (escitalopram) for patients with major depressive disorder.[12](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-12) This randomised controlled trial reported that psilocybin showed a better efficacy than escitalopram on the 17 item Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD-17).

We aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness and acceptability of oral monotherapy with psychedelics and escitalopram in patients experiencing depressive symptoms. Given that unsuccessful blinding can potentially lead to a reduced placebo response in psychedelic trials, we distinguished between the placebo responses in psychedelic and antidepressant trials. We also investigated the differences in patient responses between people who received extremely low dose psychedelics as a placebo and those who received a placebo in the form of a fake pill, such as niacin, in psilocybin trials.[13](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-13)[14](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-14) Our study allowed for a relative effect assessment of psychedelics compared with placebo responses observed in antidepressant trials.

Methods
-------

The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023469014). We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension statement for reporting systematic reviews incorporating network meta-analysis (NMA) (appendix 1).[15](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-15)

### Data sources and searches

A comprehensive search of the Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrial.gov, and World Health Organization’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases were performed without language restrictions from database inception to 12 October 2023. We also searched the grey literature and reviewed reference lists of the included studies and related systematic reviews.[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-2)[3](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-3)

### Study selection

Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials with parallel group or crossover designs. We included: (i) adults (≥18 years) with clinically diagnosed depression (eg, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or other psychiatric disorders with comorbid clinical depression) or life threatening diagnoses and terminal illness with depressive symptoms; and (ii) adults with assessment of treatment response (preapplication/postapplication) using standard, validated, and internationally recognised instruments, such as HAMD-17. The outcome of interest was the change in depressive symptoms at the end of treatment compared with the controls, and we only extracted data from the first phase of crossover randomised controlled trials to avoid carry-over effects. Eligible psychedelic randomised controlled trials (including psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide, MDMA, and ayahuasca without dosage limit) required oral monotherapy without the concomitant use of antidepressants. For escitalopram, we included only fixed dose randomised controlled trials that compared at least two arms with different doses of oral form escitalopram (maximum dose of 20 mg/day) with placebo because psychedelic therapies usually use a fixed dose study design. We also included randomised controlled trials that evaluated psychedelic monotherapy compared with escitalopram monotherapy. We excluded follow-up studies and studies with healthy volunteers. We also excluded conference abstracts, editorials, reviews, meta-analyses, case reports, and case series, as well as publications reporting duplicate data. We did not consider ketamine because this drug is usually administered parenterally and is not a classic psychedelic.[16](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-16) Screening and selection of the studies were performed independently by two authors. Discrepancies in study inclusion were resolved by deliberation among the reviewer pairs or with input from a third author. Appendix 2 shows the complete search strategies, and appendix 3 presents the reasons for exclusion.

### Definition of outcomes, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment

The primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms from baseline (continuous outcome), as measured by a validated rating scale, such as HAMD-17. When multiple measurement tools were used, they were selected in the following order: the HAMD-17, Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale, and Beck depression inventory (second edition). To improve interpretability, all extracted depression scores were converted to corresponding HAMD-17 scores using a validated method.[17](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-17) We used a conservative correlation coefficient of 0.5 or other statistics (eg, t statistics) to calculate the standard deviation of change from baseline when unreported.[18](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-18) The secondary outcomes were all cause discontinuation and severe adverse events (categorical outcomes). Severe adverse events were classified as those resulting in any of a list of negative health outcomes including, death, admission to hospital, significant or persistent incapacity, congenital birth defect or abnormality, and suicide attempt. Outcome data were extracted from original intention-to-treat or last observation carrying forward analysis, as well as from estimates of mixed-effect models for repeated measures.

Two authors independently extracted and reviewed the data, each being reviewed by another author. WebPlot Digitizer ([https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/)) was used to extract numerical data from the figures. Two authors independently used the Cochrane randomised trial risk of bias tool (version 2.0) to assess the risk of bias in the included trials, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus.[19](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-19)

### Data synthesis

To estimate the relative effect between two interventions, we computed mean difference on the basis of change values (with 95% credible interval) for continuous outcomes (change in depressive symptoms) and odds ratios for categorical outcomes (all cause discontinuation and severe adverse event). To assess the clinical significance of the relative effect, we evaluated whether the mean difference exceeded the minimal important difference, which is estimated to be 3 points for HAMD-17.[20](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-20) We defined high, low, and extremely low doses of the included psychedelics as follows: (i) psilocybin: high dose (≥20 mg), extremely low dose (1-3 mg), low dose (other range); and (ii) MDMA: high dose (≥100 mg), extremely low dose (≤40 mg), low dose (other range). Escitalopram was divided into escitalopram 10 mg and escitalopram ≥20 mg. In previous clinical trials, a dose of 1 mg of psilocybin or a dose range of 1-3 mg/70 kg were used as an active control because these doses were believed not to produce significant psychedelic effects.[21](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-21)[22](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-22) A dose of 5 mg/70 kg can produce noticeable psychedelic effects.[22](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-22) In many two arm psilocybin trials, the psilocybin dose in the active group typically falls within the range of 20-30 mg.[12](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-12)[21](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-21)[23](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-23)[24](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-24) In a three arm trial, 25 mg was defined as high dose, and 10 mg was considered a moderate dose.[21](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-21) Another clinical trial also defined 0.215 mg/kg of psilocybin as a moderate dose for the active group.[25](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-25) Therefore, we used 20 mg and 3 mg as the boundaries for grouping psilocybin doses; when the dosage was calculated per kilogram in the study, we converted it to per 70 kg. For MDMA, in two trials with three arms, 125 mg was defined as high dose, and 30-40 mg was defined as active control.[26](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-26)[27](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-27) Thus, we used 100 mg and 40 mg as the boundaries for grouping MDMA doses.

We conducted random effects network meta-analysis and meta-analysis within a Bayesian framework.[28](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-28)[29](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-29) Previous meta-analyses considered all control groups as a common comparator; however, concerns have been raised regarding the overestimated effect sizes of psychedelics because of unsuccessful blinding and poor placebo response.[9](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-9) Therefore, we treated the three treatments as distinct interventions: the placebo response observed in psychedelic trials, the placebo response observed in antidepressant escitalopram trials, and extremely low dose psychedelics (ie, psilocybin and MDMA). We calculated the relative effects of all interventions compared with these three groups, indicating the following three conditions: (1) the treatment response of placebo response in the psychedelic trials is assumed to be lower than that of placebo response in antidepressant trials because of unsuccessful blinding.[9](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-9) As such, the relative effects compared with placebo response in the psychedelic trials represented potential overestimated effect sizes. (2) the placebo response in antidepressant trials is assumed to be the placebo response in antidepressant trials with adequate blinding, therefore, the relative effects compared with placebo response in antidepressant trials represents effect sizes in trials with adequate blinding. (3) Psychedelic drugs are usually administered with psychotherapy[13](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-13) or psychological support,[14](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-14) the relative effects of psychedelics compared with extremely low dose psychedelics might eliminate the concomitant effects from psychotherapeutic support, approximating so-called pure pharmacological effects.

In network meta-analysis, the validity of indirect comparison relies on transitivity assumption.[30](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-30) We assessed the transitivity assumption by comparing the distribution of potential effect modifies across treatment comparisons. In addition, we assessed whether the efficacy of escitalopram is similar in placebo controlled randomised controlled trials (escitalopram _v_ placebo response in antidepressant trials) and in the head-to-head randomised controlled trial (psilocybin _v_ escitalopram) using network meta-analysis.[12](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-12) Furthermore, we assessed the efficacy of the different placebo responses (placebo response in the psychedelic trials _v_ placebo response in antidepressant trials) as additional proof of transitivity. If the placebo response in antidepressant trials was better than that in the psychedelic trials, the transitivity assumption did not hold when grouping placebo response in antidepressant trials and placebo response in the psychedelic trials together. Finally, for the primary outcome (change in depressive symptoms), network meta-regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of potential effect modifiers, including proportion of men and women in the study, mean age, baseline depression severity, disorder type, and follow-up assessment period. We assumed a common effect on all treatment comparisons for each of the effect modifiers. In other words, all interactions between the treatment comparisons and the effect modifier were constrained to be identical.

We also conducted the following sensitivity analyses: analysing studies of patients with major depressive disorder; excluding studies with a high risk of bias; adjusting for baseline depression severity; and using correlation coefficient of zero (most conservative) to calculate the standard deviation of change from baseline when unreported.

Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of a comparison adjusted funnel plots. The first funnel plot used placebo response in the psychedelic trials as the comparator. The second funnel plot used placebo response in antidepressant trials as the comparator. The third funnel plot used both placebo response in the psychedelic trials and placebo response in antidepressant trials as comparators simultaneously. Additionally, we conducted the Egger test, Begg test, and Thompson test to examine the asymmetry of the third funnel plot. A previous meta-analysis reported that the standardised mean difference of psychedelics for depression reduction ranged from 1.37 to 3.12.[2](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-2) Therefore, we also transformed the effect size of mean difference to standardised mean difference (Hedges’ g) for the primary outcome. The global inconsistency of the network meta-analysis was examined by fitting an unrelated main effects model. Local inconsistency of the network meta-analysis was examined using node splitting methods.[31](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-31) Four Markov chains were implemented. 50 000 iterations occurred per chain and the first 20 000 iterations for each chain were discarded as a warm-up. Convergence was assessed by visual inspection of the trace plots of the key parameters for each analysis. The prior settings and convergence results are shown in appendix 4. All statistical analyses were done using R version 4.3.1. The network meta-analysis and pairwise meta-analysis within a Bayesian framework were fitted using the Bayesian statistical software called Stan within the R packages multinma[28](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-28) and brms,[29](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-29) respectively. The frequentist random effects network meta-analysis, funnel plots, and tests for funnel plot asymmetry were conducted using the R package netmeta. Reasons for protocol changes are in appendix 5.

### Assessment certainty of evidence for the primary outcome

The certainty of evidence produced by the network meta-analysis was evaluated using GRADE (Grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation).[32](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-32)[33](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-33) We used a minimally contextualised framework with the value of 3 (minimal important difference) as our decision threshold. The certainty of evidence refers to our certainty that the intervention had, relative to minimal intervention, any clinically minimal important difference. The optimal information size was calculated using a validated method.[32](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-32)[33](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-33)[34](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-34)

### Patient and public involvement

Both patients and the public are interested in research on novel depression treatments and their efficacy compared with existing antidepressants. However, due to a scarcity of available funding for recruitment and researcher training, patients and members of the public were not directly involved in the planning or writing of this manuscript. We did speak to patients about the study, and we asked a member of the public to read our manuscript after submission.

Results

### Characteristics of included study

After searching the database and excluding duplicated records, we identified 3104 unique potential studies. We then screened the titles and abstracts of these studies for eligibility and excluded 3062 of them, in which 42 studies remained. Twenty six studies were excluded after an assessment of the full text for various reasons (appendix 3). We identified three additional studies through a manual search resulting in total 19 eligible studies (efigure 1). Details of the characteristics of the included studies are shown in etable 1. Protocols of psychological support or psychotherapy with psychedelic treatment are shown in etable 2. Overall, 811 people (mean age of 42.49 years, 54.2% (440/811) were women) were included in psychedelic trials (15 trials), and 1968 participants (mean age of 39.35 years, 62.5% (1230/1968) were women) were included in escitalopram trials (five trials).

### Risk of bias of the included studies

No psychedelic study (0/15) had a high overall risk of bias (efigure 2A and efigure 3A). The percentages of studies with high, some concerns, or low risk of bias in the 15 psychedelic trials were as follows: 0% (k=15), 33% (k=5), and 67% (k=10) for randomisation; 0% (k=0), 33% (k=5), and 67% (k=10) for deviations from intended interventions; 0% (k=0), 13% (k=2), and 87% (k=13) for missing outcome data; 0% (k=0), 33% (k=5), and 67% (k=10) for measurements of outcomes; 0% (k=0), 67% (k=1), and 93% (k=14) for selection of reported results. No non-psychedelic studies (0/5) were rated as high risk of bias (efigure 2B and efigure 3B). The percentages of studies with high, some concerns, and low risk of bias in the five non-psychedelic trials were as follows: 0% (k=0), 80% (k=4), and 20% (k=1) for randomisation; 0% (k=0), 100% (k=5), and 0% (k=0) for deviations from intended interventions; 0% (k=0), 80% (k=4), and 20% (k=1) for missing outcome data; 0% (k=0), 80% (k=4), and 20% (k=1) for measurements of outcomes; 0% (k=0), 20% (k=1), and 80% (k=4) for selection of reported results.

### Network meta-analysis

In the network structure, all interventions were connected, with two main structures ([fig 1](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#F1)). All psychedelics were compared with placebo response in the psychedelic trials, and escitalopram was compared with placebo response in antidepressant trials. A head-to-head comparison of high dose psilocybin and 20 mg escitalopram connected the two main structures.[12](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-12)

In the main network meta-analysis, all interventions, except for extremely low dose and low dose MDMA, were associated with a larger mean difference exceeding the minimal important difference of 3 points on the HAMD-17 than with placebo response in the psychedelic trials ([fig 2](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#F2)). Notably, placebo response in antidepressant trials (3.79 (95% credibile interval 0.77 to 6.80)) and extremely low dose psilocybin (3.96 (0.61 to 7.17)) were better than placebo response in the psychedelic trials, with mean differences exceeding 3 and 95% credibile intervals that did not cross zero. Additionally, in comparison with placebo response in antidepressant trials ([fig 2](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#F2)), the relative effects of high dose psilocybin (6.52 (3.19 to 9.57)), escitalopram 10 mg (1.86 (0.21 to 3.50)), and escitalopram 20 mg (1.82 (0.16 to 3.43)) did not cross zero. Only high dose psilocybin resulted in a mean difference that was greater than 3. The standardised mean difference of high dose psilocybin decreased from large (0.88) to small (0.31) when the reference arm was changed from placebo response in the psychedelic trials to placebo response in antidepressant trials.

When compared with extremely low dose psilocybin ([fig 2](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#F2)), only the relative effects of high dose psilocybin (6.35 (95% credibile interval 3.41 to 9.21)) and placebo response in the psychedelic trials (−3.96 (−7.17 to −0.61)) showed a larger mean difference exceeding 3, without crossing zero. All relative effects between interventions are showed in efigure 4. Importantly, the mean differences of high dose psilocybin compared with escitalopram 10 mg (4.66 (1.36 to 7.74); standardised mean difference 0.22), escitalopram 20 mg (4.69 (1.64 to 7.54); 0.24), high dose MDMA (4.98 (1.23 to 8.67); 0.32), and low dose psilocybin (4.36 (1.20 to 7.51); 0.32) all exceeded 3 and did not cross zero (efigure 4).

### Transitivity assumption

The assessment of transitivity assumption is showed in efigure 5 and efigure 6. We compared the efficacy of escitalopram in the placebo controlled antidepressant trials[8](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-8) with that in the head-to-head trial (psilocybin _v_ escitalopram)[12](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-12) using network meta-analysis and pairwise meta-analysis. The results of the network meta-analysis showed that the relative effects between these two study designs (0.64 (95% credibile interval −4.41 to 5.40), efigure 6A; 1.94 (−2.66 to 6.14), efigure 6B) included zero, and the mean differences did not exceed 3. Placebo response in antidepressant trials was better than placebo response in the psychedelic trials with a small effect size (3.79 (0.77 to 6.80), standardised mean difference 0.2), and the mean difference exceed 3 ([fig 2](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#F2)).

### Sensitivity analyses

When including only patients with major depressive disorder, the relative effects of escitalopram 20 mg, escitalopram 10 mg, ayahuasca, and high dose psilocybin were better than placebo response in antidepressant trials, while placebo response in the psychedelic trials was worse than placebo response in antidepressant trials ([fig 3](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#F3)). However, only the mean differences for high dose psilocybin (6.82 (95% credibile interval 3.84 to 9.67)), ayahuasca (5.38 (0.02 to 10.61)), and placebo response in the psychedelic trials (−4.00 (−6.87 to −1.13)) exceeded 3. When compared with extremely low dose psilocybin (excluding the effects from concomitant psychotherapeutic support), only the 95% credibile intervals of the relative effects of high dose psilocybin (4.36 (0.54 to 8.27); standardised mean difference 0.30) and placebo response in the psychedelic trials (−6.46 (−10.41 to −2.32), standardised mean difference −0.46) exceeded 3 and did not cross zero ([fig 3](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#F3)). All of the relative effects between interventions are showed in efigure 7. Notably, the relative effects of high dose psilocybin compared with escitalopram 10 mg (4.96 (1.97 to 7.82)), escitalopram 20 mg (4.97 (2.19 to 7.64)), and low dose psilocybin (3.82 (0.61 to 7.04)) all exceeded 3 and did not cross zero (efigure 7).

The other three sensitivity analyses showed similar findings with the main analyses: exclusion of studies with high risk of bias (efigure 8); adjustment of baseline depression severity (efigure 9); and use of most conservative correlation coefficient of zero (efigure 10).

### All cause discontinuation and severe adverse event

When referencing placebo in psychedelic trials, no interventions were associated with higher risks of all cause discontinuation rate nor severe adverse event rate (efigure 11).

### Network meta-regression and publication bias

In network meta-regression analyses, the 95% credibile intervals of the relative effects of the baseline depressive severity, mean age, and percentage of women, crossed zero (etable 3). The results of the statistical tests (Egger, Begg, and Thompson-Sharp tests) for funnel plot asymmetry and visual inspection of funnel plots did not show publication bias (efigure 12). The results of GRADE assessment are provided in the efigure 13. Most of the certainty of evidence for treatment comparisons was moderate or low.

### Consistency assumptions

The back calculation methods for all the models (appendix 6) did not show any inconsistencies. The node splitting methods also did not show any inconsistencies (appendix 7).

Discussion
----------

### Principal findings

This network meta-analysis investigated the comparative effectiveness between psychedelics and escitalopram for depressive symptoms. Firstly, we found that the placebo response observed in antidepressant trials was associated with greater effectiveness than that observed in psychedelic trials. Secondly, when compared with placebo responses in antidepressant trials, only escitalopram and high dose psilocybin were associated with greater effectiveness, and only high dose psilocybin exceeded minimal important difference of 3. Notably, the effect size of high dose psilocybin decreased from large to small. Thirdly, among the included psychedelics, only high dose psilocybin was more likely to be better than escitalopram 10 mg or 20 mg, exceeding the minimally important difference of 3. Fourthly, in patients with major depressive disorder, escitalopram, ayahuasca, and high dose psilocybin were associated with greater effectiveness than placebo responses in antidepressant trials; however, only high dose psilocybin was better than extremely low dose psilocybin, exceeding minimal important difference of 3. Taken together, our study findings suggest that among psychedelic treatments, high dose psilocybin is more likely to reach the minimal important difference for depressive symptoms in studies with adequate blinding design, while the effect size of psilocybin was similar to that of current antidepressant drugs, showing a mean standardised mean difference of 0.3.[7](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-7)

### Comparison with other studies

In a randomised controlled trial, treatment response was defined as the response observed in the active arm; placebo response was defined as the response observed in the control (placebo) arm.[10](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-10) Treatment response consists of non-specific effects, placebo effect, and true treatment effect; placebo response consisted of non-specific effects and placebo effect. Therefore, when the placebo effect is not the same for the active and control arms within an randomised controlled trial, the estimation of the true treatment effect is biased. For example, in a psychedelic trial, unsuccessful blinding may occur due to the profound subjective effects of psychedelics. This unblinding may lead to high placebo effect in the active arm and low placebo effect in the control arms, and the true treatment effect is overestimated.[10](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-10) Without addressing unequal placebo effects within studies, the estimation of meta-analysis and network meta-analysis are biased.[10](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-10) However, in most psychedelic trials, blinding was either reported as unsuccessful or not assessed at all. For example, two trials of lysergic acid diethylamide reported unsuccessful blinding,[35](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-35)[36](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-36) whereas the trial of ayahuasca only reported that five of 10 participants misclassified the placebo as ayahuasca.[37](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-37) In trials of MDMA, participants' accuracy in guessing which treatment arm they were in ranged from approximately 60-90%.[26](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-26)[27](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-27)[38](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-38)[39](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-39)[40](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-40) In the case of most psilocybin trials, blinding was not assessed, with the exception of the study by Ross and colleagues in 2016.[13](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-13) In that study, participants were asked to guess whether the psilocybin or an active control was received, and the correct guessing rate was 97%. In our study, we established several network meta-analysis models addressing this issue, and we found that placebo response in the psychedelic trials was associated with less effectiveness than that in antidepressant trials. Therefore, the effect sizes of psychedelics compared with placebo response observed in psychedelic trials may be overestimated. All of the psychedelics’ 95% credibile intervals of the relative effects crossed zero when compared with the placebo response in antidepressant trials, except for high dose psilocybin.

The comparisons between psychedelics and escitalopram showed that high dose psilocybin was more likely to be better than escitalopram. Psilocybin was usually administered with psychotherapy or psychological support.[13](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-13)[14](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-14) Therefore, the greater effectiveness of psilocybin may be from not only pharmacological effects but also psychotherapeutic support. However, we also found that high doses of psilocybin was associated greater effectiveness than extremely low doses of psilocybin. This effect also indicates that the effectiveness of psilocybin cannot be attributed only to concomitant psychotherapy or psychological support.

In patients with major depressive disorder, ayahuasca, low dose psilocybin, high dose psilocybin, escitalopram 10 mg, and escitalopram 20 mg were associated with greater effectiveness than the placebo response in antidepressant trials . However, when compared with extremely low dose psilocybin, only high dose psilocybin was associated with better effectiveness; the standardised mean difference decreased from 0.38 (compared with placebo response in antidepressant trials) to 0.30 (compared with extremely low dose psilocybin). As such, the effectiveness of psilocybin should be considered with concomitant psychotherapeutic support in people with major depressive disorder. The effect size of high dose psilocybin was similar with antidepressant trials of patients with major depressive disorder showing a mean standardised mean difference of 0.3.[7](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-7)[8](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-8)

### Strengths and limitations of this study

This study has several strengths. We conducted separate analyses for placebo response in antidepressant trials, placebo response in psychedelic trials, and an extremely low active dose of psychedelics, thereby mitigating the effect of placebo response variations across different studies. This approach allowed us to assess the efficacy of psychedelics more impartially and make relatively unbiased comparisons than if these groups were not separated. This study supported the transitivity assumption of the efficacy of escitalopram in placebo controlled antidepressant trials with that in psilocybin versus escitalopram head-to-head trial, thereby bridging the escitalopram trials and psychedelic trials. We also performed various sensitivity analyses to ensure the validation of our statistical results.

Nevertheless, our study has several limitations. Firstly, we extracted only the acute effects of the interventions. A comparison of the long term effects of psychedelics and escitalopram remains unclear. Secondly, participants in the randomised controlled trials on MDMA were predominantly diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, whereas participants in the randomised controlled trials on escitalopram were patients with major depressive disorder. However, depressive symptoms in post-traumatic stress disorder could be relatively treatment resistant, requiring high doses of psychotropic drugs.[41](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-41) Moreover, our study focused not only on major depressive disorder but also on the generalisability of psychedelic treatment for depressive symptoms. Thirdly, although all available studies were included, the sample size of the psychedelic randomised controlled trials was small (k=15). Fourthly, when using extremely low dose psychedelics as a reference group, the relative effect may also eliminate some pharmacological effects because our study found that extremely low dose psychedelics could not be considered a placebo. Fifthly, in network meta-analysis, direct evidence for one treatment comparison may serve as indirect evidence for other treatment comparisons,[42](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-42) and biases in the direct evidence might affect estimates of other treatment comparisons. Because the absolute effect of escitalopram in the head-to-head trial (high dose psilocybin _v_ escitalopram 20 mg)[12](https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078607#ref-12) was lower than those of placebo controlled trials, the relative effects of high dose psilocybin might be slightly overestimated when compared with other treatments in the current study. We addressed this issue by use of a Bayesian network meta-analysis, distinguishing between placebo response in psychedelic trials and placebo response in antidepressant trials. Specifically, we only considered that the 95% credibile interval of the relative effect between two comparisons did not cross zero. Indeed, the relative effect of escitalopram 20 mg between these two study designs included zero. Finally, our network meta-analysis may not have sufficient statistical power to detect potential publication bias due to the scarcity of trials and participants.

### Implications and conclusions

Serotonergic psychedelics, especially high dose psilocybin, appeared to have the potential to treat depressive symptoms. However, study designs may have overestimated the efficacy of psychedelics. Our analysis suggested that the standardised mean difference of high dose psilocybin was similar to that of current antidepressant drugs, showing a small effect size. Improved blinding methods and standardised psychotherapies can help researchers to better estimate the efficacy of psychedelics for depressive symptoms and other psychiatric conditions.

#### What is already known on this topic

*   Psychedelic treatment resulted in significant efficacy in treating depressive symptoms and alleviating distress related to life threatening diagnoses and terminal illness
    
*   Meta-analyses have reported standardised mean difference of psychedelics for depression reduction ranging from 1.37 to 3.12, while antidepressant trials were approximately 0.3
    
*   No network meta-analysis has examined comparative efficacy between psychedelics and antidepressants for depressive symptoms, and effect sizes of psychedelics might be overestimated because of unsuccessful blinding and response expectancies
    

#### What this study adds

*   To avoid estimation bias, placebo responses in psychedelic and antidepressant trials were separated; placebo response in psychedelic trials was lower than that in antidepressant trials
    
*   Among all psychedelics studied, only high dose psilocybin was associated with greater effectiveness than placebo response in antidepressant trials (standardised mean difference 0.31)
    
*   Among all psychedelics, only high dose psilocybin was associated with greater effectiveness than escitalopram

Join us in exploring groundbreaking insights from the PNOC016 trial presented by Dr. Cassie Kline. This trial investigated a novel therapeutic approach using fimepinostat to enhance drug penetration in high-risk pediatric brain tumors, particularly focusing on diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, medulloblastoma, and other high-grade gliomas.  

Dr. Kline emphasizes the importance of evaluating not just survival but also how effectively therapies penetrate tumors and the pharmacodynamic markers that indicate response. This pivotal research could reshape the design of future clinical trials in pediatric oncology.

PHILADELPHIA — In this video, **Cassie Kline, MD, MAS****,** discusses the results of the PNOC016 trial she presented at International Symposium on Pediatric Neuro-Oncology.

The study observed the intratumoral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic results of fimepinostat (Curis) in treating high-risk brain tumors in children and young adults with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, recurrent medulloblastoma or recurrent high-grade gliomas.

“\[These\] novel clinical trials \[explore\] not just the impact of drug on survival but \[look\] at intratumoral drug penetration and pharmacodynamic markers of response and \[present\] on ways in which we should be thinking about trial design and how we are answering or addressing questions of ‘how’ or ‘why’ a drug is working,” Kline, a pediatric neuro-oncology attending and director of neuro-oncology clinical research at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said.

New research presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress indicates that finerenone significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular death and worsening heart failure in patients with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. In the FINEARTS-HF trial, finerenone showed a 16% reduction in these risks compared to placebo, marking an exciting advancement in treatment options following SGLT2 inhibitors.  

This study highlights the importance of integrating finerenone as a complementary therapy alongside existing treatments, such as SGLT2 inhibitors. With a robust efficacy profile and favorable safety outcomes, including manageable rates of hyperkalemia, finerenone could provide substantial benefits in this challenging patient population.

*   Finerenone reduced risk for CV death and worsening heart failure vs. placebo in this patient population.
*   Pooled analyses demonstrated the benefits of finerenone and other MRAs in high-risk patients.

In patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, finerenone reduced risk for CV death and worsening HF by 16% compared with placebo, researchers reported at the European Society of Cardiology Congress.

The results of [the double-blind, randomized FINEARTS-HF trial](https://www.healio.com/news/cardiology/20240805/topline-results-finerenone-reduces-events-in-certain-patients-with-heart-failure), simultaneously published in _The New England Journal of Medicine_, mean that finerenone (Kerendia, Bayer), a nonsteroidal selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, represents the second class of drugs to have a positive CV outcomes trial in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF, following SGLT2 inhibitors, **Scott D. Solomon, MD,** the Edward D. Frohlich Distinguished Chair and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and senior physician and director of the Clinical Trials Outcomes Center at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, told Healio.

“We currently have one clear winner in [patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction](https://www.healio.com/news/cardiology/20240828/glp1s-may-improve-outcomes-when-added-to-sglt2-therapy-for-hfpef-diabetes-and-obesity), which are SGLT2 inhibitors ... and in the U.S. we have the availability of sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto, Novartis), and the FDA has given it an expanded indication for mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, but they have qualified that by saying it is most effective in patients with ejection fraction below normal,” Solomon told Healio. “With these data, we are now potentially able to add at least a second pillar ... to SGLT2 inhibitors in treating patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.”

In related Hot Line session presentations at the ESC Congress, a meta-analysis of trials of MRAs in patients with HF, simultaneously published in _The Lancet_, showed that the drug class lowers risk for CV death or HF hospitalization by 34% in patients with HF with reduced EF and by 13% in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF. In addition, the FINE-HEART pooled analysis of the FINEARTS-HF, FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials, simultaneously published in _Nature Medicine_, showed finerenone lowered risk for various heart- and kidney-related outcomes in patients with a variety of cardio-kidney-metabolic disorders including HF, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

FINEARTS-HF
-----------

Solomon and colleagues randomly assigned 6,001 patients with symptomatic HF and EF of 40% or more (mean age, 72 years; 45% women; mean EF, 53%) to receive once-daily finerenone (maximum dose, 20 mg for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 40 mg for patients with eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) or placebo on top of usual therapy. Median follow-up was 32 months.

“We knew that finerenone was beneficial in patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetes, because there had been two large outcome trials, FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, in that population,” Solomon told Healio. “The efficacy of MRAs at all in patients with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction has not been established. The TOPCAT trial tested the steroidal MRA spironolactone in patients with HFpEF. TOPCAT did not meet its primary endpoint, but post hoc analyses suggested there were patients enrolled in that trial, primarily in Russia and the Republic of Georgia, who didn’t actually have heart failure and probably were not taking \[the study\] medication. A lot of people have said that had we done that trial in the right patients, then there may have been a benefit \[for MRAs in HFpEF\]. But the data have not been definitive. In the U.S. guidelines, spironolactone has a Class IIb indication. In the European guidelines, it does not have a guideline-recommended indication for this patient population. Therefore, we intended to determine whether finerenone — which is more selective for the MR receptor than steroidal MRAs, has a shorter half-life and has more balanced distribution between the heart and the kidneys — could benefit patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.”

During the study period, the primary outcome of total worsening HF events (defined as first or recurrent unplanned hospitalization or urgent visit for HF) and CV death occurred 1,083 times in the finerenone group and 1,283 times in the placebo group (rate ratio = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.95; _P_ = .007; absolute risk reduction, 3.3 per 100 patient-years), Solomon told Healio.

The results were driven by worsening HF events (finerenone, 842; placebo, 1,024; rate ratio = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.94; _P_ = .006) as opposed to CV death (finerenone, 8.1%; placebo, 8.7%; HR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78-1.11), the researchers found. All-cause mortality was not different between the groups (HR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83-1.06), Solomon said.

The finerenone group had greater improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score (+ 8 vs. + 6.4; between-arm difference, + 1.6; 95% CI, 0.8-2.3; _P_ < .001), Solomon told Healio.

Serious adverse events occurred in approximately 40% of both groups, he said.

“We saw more hyperkalemia, as expected with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist,” Solomon told Healio. “But the incidence of severe hyperkalemia — for example, hyperkalemia leading to hospitalization — was very small, 0.5% in the finerenone group and 0.2% in the placebo group, and there were no cases of hyperkalemia leading to death. We saw considerably less hypokalemia in the finerenone group than in the placebo group.”

Approximately one-fifth of patients in both groups discontinued the study medication before the end of the trial, he told Healio.

The primary endpoint results were consistent across all specified subgroups, and did not vary by sex, EF or whether a patient was taking an SGLT2 inhibitor — “the only current guideline-recommended therapy in this population” — at baseline, he told Healio.

“There is still considerable residual risk in this population despite the use of drugs like SGLT2 inhibitors,” Solomon told Healio. “Here, we have the ability to further reduce morbidity and mortality in these patients. This was a win for finerenone.”

MRA meta-analysis
-----------------

**Pardeep S. Jhund, MBChB, PhD,** professor of cardiology and epidemiology at the University of Glasgow and honorary consultant cardiologist at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, U.K., and colleagues conducted an individual patient-level meta-analysis of four trials of MRAs in patients with HF:

*   FINEARTS-HF;
*   TOPCAT;
*   RALES, which analyzed spironolactone in patients with HFrEF; and
*   EMPHASIS-HF, which analyzed eplerenone in patients with HFrEF.

In the entire cohort of 13,846 patients, MRAs were associated with reduced risk for CV death or HF hospitalization (HR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.72-0.83), but the effect size was greater in HFrEF (HR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.59-0.73) than in HFmrEF/HFpEF (HR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79-0.95; _P_ for interaction = .012), Jhund said at a press conference.

MRAs reduced HF hospitalization in all trials, and they reduced CV death and all-cause death in the HFrEF trials but not the HFmrEF/HFpEF trials, according to the researchers.

MRAs doubled the risk for hyperkalemia and halved the risk for hypokalemia, but the incidence of serious hyperkalemia was low, he said.

“This meta-analysis ... confirms the benefits of MRAs in heart failure,” Jhund said at the press conference. “We should use MRAs in patients with heart failure without a contraindication.”

FINE-HEART pooled analysis
--------------------------

**Muthiah Vaduganathan, MD, MPH,** cardiologist and co-director of the Center for Cardiometabolic Implementation Science at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and on faculty at Harvard Medical School, and colleagues conducted the FINE-HEART pooled analysis of three trials of finerenone:

*   FINEARTS-HF in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF;
*   FIDELIO-DKD; and
*   FIGARO-DKD.

“Despite advances in medical therapy, the burden of \[cardio-kidney-metabolic syndrome\] has remained very high at the population level,” Vaduganathan said at the press conference. “Each of these trials had individual endpoints, but none were individually powered for mortality, so that was of particular importance to this analysis.”

The primary endpoint of CV death did not significantly favor finerenone vs. placebo (HR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78-1.01; _P_ = .076), he said.

“We found that a large number of deaths could not specifically be adjudicated as cardiovascular vs. non-cardiovascular etiology, so in a prespecified sensitivity analysis considering undetermined deaths as cardiovascular deaths, that improved the certainty of evidence,” he said. In that analysis, finerenone reduced risk for CV death by 12% (HR = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.98; _P_ = .025), Vaduganathan said.

In addition, compared with placebo, finerenone reduced risk for all-cause mortality (HR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99; _P_ = .027), HF hospitalization (HR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.92; _P_ < .001) and the composite kidney endpoint of sustained eGFR decline of 50% or more, kidney failure or death due to kidney failure (HR = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.72-0.9; _P_ < .001), he said.

The pooled analysis did not reveal any new or unexpected safety signals, and the results were consistent across all subgroups, including whether a patient was taking an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1 receptor agonist at baseline, he said.

“The totality of evidence supports the disease-modifying potential of finerenone in broad, high-risk populations with overlapping cardiovascular, kidney and metabolic conditions,” Vaduganathan said.

[Carlos G. Santos-Gallego, MD](https://www.healio.com/authors/csantosgallego)

HF with EF of 40% or more is a key population and, for many years, we did not have an effective treatment. Recently, we got positive results from the SGLT2 inhibitors in this population, and some positive results from semaglutide 2.4 mg (Wegovy, Novo Nordisk) in patients with HFpEF and obesity. We also have the very controversial TOPCAT trial, with a famous geographical imbalance. The trial was positive if patients from Russia and the Republic of Georgia were excluded, so many doctors in the Americas have prescribed spironolactone for patients with HFpEF.

However, a problem with spironolactone is that the rates of hyperkalemia are very high, and there is concern that the increased potassium levels may be negative for the patient. Now, we have a nonsteroidal MRA that causes less risk for hyperkalemia than spironolactone. In FINEARTS-HF, we learned that finerenone improves hard endpoints in patients with moderately reduced EF (40%-50%) and HFpEF (over 50%). But the effect size was moderate, 16%, compared with SGLT2 inhibitors, which reduce CV death and HF worsening by 30% to 35%. A reduction in CV death with finerenone was not expected, because there was no reduction in CV death with SGLT2 inhibitors; the results for all have been driven by HF events.

While finerenone is a nonsteroidal MRA and induces less hyperkalemia than steroidal MRAs, the rates of hyperkalemia were higher, almost double, in the finerenone group than in the control group. The rates of hospitalization for hyperkalemia were very low, which is reassuring. Of note, we are starting to become more comfortable with hyperkalemia. In the past, as soon as potassium reached 5 mmol/L, many doctors would stop the MRA for fear of a ventricular arrhythmia. There was a lingering fear about it. But right now, we are starting to realize two things. No. 1, on some occasions, allowing a potassium level up to 5.5 mmol/L does not increase mortality and still gives the patient the benefit of taking the medication. No. 2, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the rate of hyperkalemia. Almost every patient with HFpEF should be on an SGLT2 inhibitor, so this will reduce the risk for hyperkalemia posed by spironolactone or finerenone.

So far, finerenone is approved for nephology indications, but in my practice, the rate of prescription is very low. When finerenone gets approved by the FDA for HFmrEF and HFpEF, it will definitely be used for that population.

The question will be the price. Finerenone is an expensive medication. Maybe some doctors will continue to prescribe spironolactone, which is much cheaper. The rate of uptake will depend on the approval of insurance companies. Polypharmacy will also be a consideration. Patients with HFpEF are already on many medications, and finerenone would be another. And will insurance companies approve two or all of an SGLT2 inhibitor, a GLP-1 receptor agonist and finerenone for the same patient? None of them are cheap. If cost is an issue, the cardiologist will have to decide which one to focus on. It’s hard to say, but I think some cardiologists will go for semaglutide, because it has additional benefits on the kidneys, as the FLOW trial demonstrated, and on reducing obesity. If there is no problem with insurance approval, then cardiologists will prescribe finerenone to our patients.

In a disappointing turn of events, Timber Pharmaceuticals has announced that their Phase 3 trial of TMB-001, a topical isotretinoin formulation aimed at treating moderate to severe congenital ichthyosis, did not meet its primary and secondary endpoints. After initially promising Phase 2b results, the study observed an unexpectedly high vehicle response rate, leading to a significant setback in clinical development.  

As dermatologists, it's crucial we stay informed about the latest treatment advancements and trials. This outcome reinforces the need for continued research and innovation in treating rare skin conditions.

*   TMB-001 is an investigational topical reformulation of isotretinoin for the treatment of congenital ichthyosis.
*   The phase 3 program evaluating TMB-001 did not meet primary and secondary endpoints.

Timber Pharmaceutical’s study investigating the use of a new topical ointment formulation of isotretinoin for moderate to severe congenital ichthyosis did not achieve its endpoints, LEO Pharma announced in a press release.

[As Healio previously reported](https://www.healio.com/news/dermatology/20240124/leo-pharma-acquires-timber-pharmaceuticals-bankruptcy-assets-including-tmb001), Timber Pharmaceuticals filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2023. Since then, LEO Pharma acquired the company including its orphan, fast track and breakthrough designated asset, TMB-001.

     ![Image 5: Generic Industry News infographic](https://www.healio.com/~/media/slack-news/generic-infographics/2023/generic-industry-news.jpg?w=800)

Timber Pharmaceutical’s study investigating the use of a new topical ointment formulation of isotretinoin for moderate to severe congenital ichthyosis did not achieve its endpoints.

TMB-001 is an investigational topical reformulation of isotretinoin that has been evaluated in a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, 12-week study called [ASCEND](https://www.healio.com/news/dermatology/20220627/timber-initiates-phase-3-trial-of-topical-isotretinoin-for-congenital-ichthyosis) for the treatment of patients aged 6 years or older with either the autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis or X-linked recessive ichthyosis subtypes.

While the drug [initially produced encouraging results](https://www.healio.com/news/dermatology/20230414/topical-isotretinoin-ointment-shows-reassuring-efficacy-safety-in-congenital-ichthyosis) in congenital ichthyosis, the company has announced that the current trial did not show a statistically significant difference between the proportion of patients that responded to treatment with TMB-001 vs. placebo after 12 weeks.

“We are disappointed and saddened by the results of the phase 3 trial,” **John** **Koconis****,** CEO of Timber Pharmaceuticals, said in the release. “After encouraging phase 2b results, we observed an unexpectedly high vehicle response in this trial. We had hoped that TMB-001 could have been a new potential treatment to help children and adults suffering from moderate to severe congenital ichthyosis and to allow them to live a quality life they had previously not known.”

According to the release, these results will not have a material impact on the 2024 financial results for LEO Pharma. Full study results will be released at a later date.

Your goal is to create posts that begin with a strong, specific, attention-grabbing headline relevant to the medical community. The content should be concise, informative, and focused on topics such as new research findings, emerging medical technologies, or best practices in patient care. Include a subtle call to action that encourages doctors to engage with the content, whether by commenting, sharing their experiences, or exploring additional resources. The tone should be professional yet natural and approachable, and you should incorporate relevant visuals and hashtags to increase the post’s reach and credibility within the medical field.

This is the second episode of our 3-part series on HIV care and management. This is a continuing collaboration working with our partners _Contemporary Pediatrics_ and _Contemporary OB/GYN_.

This series discusses several aspects of HIV care including clinical management, therapies, vaccines, and multidrug resistance.  
  
Our panel of clinicians includes:

*   MJ Kasten, MD, associate professor of Medicine, consultant, Division of Public Health, Infectious Diseases, and Occupational Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic
*   Natasha Hoyte, MPH, CPNP-PC, New York-Presbyterian School Based Health Centers
*   Aimalohi Ahonkhai, MD, MPH, associate physician, medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital, associate director of the Bio-behavioral and Community Science Core and director of the Community Engaged Research Program for the Harvard University Center for AIDS Research
*   Jessica Castilho, MD, associate professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, associate professor Dept. of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center

In this episode, the panel provides clinical feedback on HIV and aging, multidrug resistant HIV, and vaccines.

Castilho says for those patients who are older and who have managed HIV as a chronic condition for years can often be at a higher risk of aging comorbidities.

“We've already heard that HIV treatment has become a lot easier, but the health concerns of older adults living with HIV are increasingly complex, not necessarily because of management of their HIV, but because of the excess and often earlier onset of these comorbidities that many people with HIV experience,” Castilho said. “They are at higher risk for conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers and other conditions which really affect their daily quality of life and physical function. So, many times the health concerns that we're encountering and patients are managing on a daily basis are not HIV, but are these chronic comorbidities, and their subsequent conditions like polypharmacy or needing to navigate taking multiple medications.”

With regards to an HIV vaccine, the clinicians acknowledge the complexity of developing a vaccine for the virus, but acknowledge another virus that was helped in the process.

“Using COVID as an analogy is helpful because we all experienced viral evolution and understanding how certain parts of a virus can change over time that we needed different vaccines to manage the COVID pandemic and HIV…so it makes it inordinately challenging to find a vaccine,” Ahonkhai said.

“The virus itself is very smart and very tricky, and makes this challenging. A lot of mRNA research that led to the COVID vaccine being developed had come out of the HIV field. So, we have HIV to thank even though we don't have a vaccine for HIV just yet…but I think we're all hopeful that we can get there.”

Background
----------

COPD is a major global cause of mortality. Predictive models like Body mass index, Obstruction, Dyspnea, Exercise capacity (BODE), Age, Dyspnea, Obstruction (ADO), and Dyspnea, Obstruction, Smoking status, Exacerbation frequency (DOSE) help identify high-risk COPD patients, but these primarily focus on all-cause mortality.

Traditional models, such as regression and random survival forests, are limited to associative predictions lacking causal insight. In contrast, probabilistic graphs, or causal graphs, can identify potential cause-effect relationships from observational data by factoring out confounders.

Further research is needed to refine and validate COPD-specific mortality predictors across diverse populations and to explore underlying biological mechanisms for targeted interventions.

About the study 
----------------

The present study followed Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, with all participants providing informed consent.

The discovery cohorts were drawn from the COPD Genetic Epidemiology (COPDGene) Study, which included 10,198 current and former smokers aged 45 to 80 years with over ten pack-years of smoking history.

Data collected included demographic, spirometry, clinical, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan features, along with all-cause and COPD-specific mortality, defined by criteria excluding deaths from comorbidities like cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cancer. The final analysis focused on 8,610 participants with complete baseline and follow-up data.

For external validation, the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points (ECLIPSE) study, which recruited 2,501 participants from the United States (US) and Europe, was used, selecting 2,312 individuals with complete three-year mortality data.

Directed probabilistic graph models were constructed using the CausalCoxMGM method to identify direct predictors of mortality while accounting for confounders.

These models were compared to ADO, Updated BODE indices, and standard machine learning approaches, with performance evaluated via cross-validation using Harrell's concordance index.

The Vital capacity-forced vital capacity (FVC) %predicted, Age, history of Pneumonia, [Oxygen saturation](https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Oxygen-Saturation.aspx), forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1)/FVC Ratio, 6-min walk Exercise capacity, Dyspnoea (VAPORED) risk score was developed using seven features linked to COPD-specific mortality, and its accuracy was validated in the ECLIPSE cohort for predicting survival over one, two, and three years.

Study results 
--------------

In the Phase 2 study, which included a subset of Phase 1 participants, notable changes were observed in clinical covariates. These changes included an expected five-year increase in age and a significant reduction in patients in the more severe Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) categories.

Additionally, there was a significant increase in the incidence of comorbidities, such as CVD and diabetes. The BODE index showed a significant decrease, while the ADO index increased in Phase 2 participants compared to Phase 1. Despite these changes, the survival functions between the two phases were not statistically different, indicating consistent all-cause mortality across both phases.

The ECLIPSE study, used for external validation, differed significantly from COPDGene, with a higher proportion of male participants and less racial diversity. The ECLIPSE cohort also included more severe COPD cases, as reflected in higher ADO, BODE, and updated BODE indices and a higher rate of all-cause mortality. This difference was significant, especially in the number of deaths observed within the first three years.

The study's analysis identified features directly linked to COPD-specific mortality. While there was significant overlap in the variables affecting all-cause and COPD-specific mortality, some differences emerged.

For example, FVC %predicted was strongly associated with COPD-specific mortality, while FEV1 %predicted was more relevant to all-cause mortality. Comorbidities like CVD and diabetes were linked only to all-cause mortality.

Graph-based predictive models, developed from these insights, outperformed traditional indices like ADO and updated BODE in predicting both all-cause and COPD-specific mortality. The models demonstrated the ability to stratify patients into distinct risk groups more effectively than the BODE index.

For external validation, the VAPORED risk score, developed using seven clinical variables, was tested on the ECLIPSE cohort. The VAPORED model significantly outperformed ADO and BODE, and updated BODE indices across several predictive metrics, particularly in the concordance probability estimate.

The model's predictions were well-calibrated for one-, two-, and three-year survival probabilities in the ECLIPSE study.

Additionally, a web-based tool was developed to allow users to calculate and compare mortality risk using the VAPORED score, BODE, and ADO indices. This tool is accessible as a Shiny app, enabling clinicians and researchers to evaluate and visualize mortality risks based on key clinical variables.

Conclusions 
------------

To summarize, this study used probabilistic graph modeling to identify features directly linked to COPD-specific and all-cause mortality, distinguishing them from simple correlates. The researchers developed the VAPORED risk score using clinical data, which outperformed traditional indices like ADO and BODE in predicting mortality.

Additionally, the study identified unique factors such as Internet access and specific biological markers associated with increased all-cause mortality risk. This approach demonstrated superior predictive power, suggesting new avenues for targeted interventions and the potential for developing more comprehensive mortality risk scores for COPD patients.

PI-2620 PET imaging is a technique whereby a patient is injected with a small amount of PI-2620 tracer which subsequently travels through the bloodstream and binds to any tau proteins in the brain.

From there, patients undergo a PET scan that detects signals emitted by PI-2620. The resultant PET images show if there are tau deposits in the brain and in which regions they are located, thereby aiding in the diagnosis and monitoring of the progression of AD and other neurodegenerative conditions in which tau deposits been implicated.

PI-2620 is currently under investigation in a Phase III trial (NCT05641688) by LMI to assess the efficacy and safety of PET imaging with PI-2620 for the detection of tau deposits in subjects with AD.

“This designation not only validates our approach but also facilitates closer collaboration with the FDA to expedite the development of PI-2620,” said LMI CMO Andrew Stephens.

“We are committed to advancing this important imaging agent with the potential to make a meaningful difference for patients who need accurate and accessible tau PET imaging.”

PI-2620 was developed in collaboration with [AC Immune](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/?cdmsid=1364813&scalar=true&utm_source=CompanyNews&utm_medium=22-215182&utm_campaign=company-profile-hyperlink-nonlgp). Primarily focused on developing treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, the Swiss biotech works with other firms and develops drug candidates through its Morphomer and SupraAntigen technology platforms.

Morphomer is capable of creating small molecules that bind to misfolded proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ), while SupraAntigen generates monoclonal antibodies to specifically target misfolding proteins.

The FDA has previously granted fast track designation to two of AC Immune’s immunotherapies, ACI-35-030 (NCT04445831) and [ACI-24060](https://pharma2.globaldata.com/DrugsView/ProductView?ProductId=160&ProductType=0,1). The compounds target tau and Aβ, respectively.

In January 2023, AC Immune [reported positive data](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/ac-immune-alzheimers-disease-vaccine-trial/?cf-view) from the ABATE trial (NCT05462106) of anti-amyloid-beta (Abeta) vaccine ACI-24060, finding that the compound elicited an anti-Abeta antibody response in ABATE’s first low dose cohort of AD patients at week six.

“The designation for PI-2620 is a further recognition of AC Immune’s drug discovery and development platform and of how we, together with our partners, continue to drive innovation,” commented AC Immune CEO Andrea Pfeifer.

GlobalData’s pharmaceutical database shows that AC Immune has a [pipeline of 20 drugs](https://pharma2.globaldata.com/Company/DrugsByCompany?gdCompanyId=114701&companyName=AC%20Immune%20SA&urlNode=ac-immune-sa&drugCategory=Pipeline&drugCategoryId=0&companyType=&licensingType=&sortColumn=SNO&pageSize=25&currentPage=1&pipelineStageIds=33&pipelineStageNames=--Select--&includeSubsidary=checked&drugNameIds=&drugNames=), chiefly for neurodegenerative conditions, in active stages of development.

GlobalData is the parent company of _Clinical Trials Arena._

The 2024 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC) took place in Philadelphia, US from 28 July to 1 August. During the conference, [Eisai announced](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/aaic-2024-eisai-presents-positive-long-term-data-with-leqembi/) that patients undergoing continuous treatment with its anti-amyloid therapy Leqembi for three years had shown a slowing of Alzheimer’s disease progression. Leqembi [received full market approval](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/analyst-comment/eisai-biogen-leqembi-fda/) from the FDA in July 2023.

2024-09-02 05:53:22,2024-09-02 10:13:11,"**🔍 New Insights on Transthyretin Variants: A Wake-Up Call for Cardiologists!**

Recent research published in JAMA Cardiology reveals that carriers of pathogenic **transthyretin (TTR)** variants might be more prevalent than previously thought, with significant implications for cardiac health. 

In a study analyzing nearly 470,000 UK Biobank participants, 0.1% carried likely pathogenic TTR variants, raising concerns about underdiagnosis of transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). The study highlights correlations between these variants and increased risks of heart failure, conduction disease, and overall mortality, stressing the need for clinical vigilance.

👉 **Clinical Takeaway:** Be attentive to your patients' genetic backgrounds and consider screening for TTR variants in individuals at risk.

Key Points**Question**  What are the prevalence, cardiac phenotypes, and outcomes of transthyretin gene (_TTR_) variants in the UK Biobank population?

**Findings**  In this cohort study of 469 789 UK Biobank participants, 0.1% were found to be carriers of likely pathogenic or pathogenic _TTR_ variants, which is higher than previously reported. Despite clinical codes suggesting low disease penetrance, cardiac expression of these genotypes was evident from associations with left ventricular mass, conduction disease, incident heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

**Meaning**  These findings emphasize the need for clinical vigilance in identifying individuals at risk of developing transthyretin amyloidosis and associated poor outcomes.

Abstract

**Importance**  The population prevalence of cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) caused by pathogenic variation in the _TTR_ gene (vATTR) is unknown.

**Objective**  To estimate the population prevalence of disease-causing _TTR_ variants and evaluate associated phenotypes and outcomes.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  This population-based cohort study analyzed UK Biobank (UKB) participants with whole-exome sequencing, electrocardiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance data. Participants were enrolled from 2006 to 2010, with a median follow-up of 12 (IQR, 11-13) years (cutoff date for the analysis, March 12, 2024). Sixty-two candidate _TTR_ variants were extracted based on rarity (minor allele frequency ≤0.0001) and/or previously described associations with amyloidosis if more frequent.

**Exposure**  Carrier status for _TTR_ variants.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  Associations of _TTR_ carrier status with vATTR prevalence and cardiovascular imaging and electrocardiogram traits were explored using descriptive statistics. Associations between _TTR_ carrier status and atrial fibrillation, conduction disease, heart failure, and all-cause mortality were evaluated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Genotypic and diagnostic concordance was examined using _International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision_ codes from the hospital record.

**Results**  The overall cohort included 469 789 UKB participants (mean \[SD\] age, 56.5 \[8.1\] years; 54.2% female and 45.8% male). A likely pathogenic/pathogenic (LP/P) _TTR_ variant was detected in 473 (0.1%) participants, with Val142Ile being the most prevalent (367 \[77.6%\]); 91 individuals (0.02%) were carriers of a variant of unknown significance . The overall prevalence of LP/P variants was 0.02% (105 of 444 243) in participants with European ancestry and 4.3% (321 of 7533) in participants with African ancestry. The LP/P variants were associated with higher left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (β = 4.66; 95% CI, 1.87-7.44), and Val142Ile was associated with a longer PR interval (β = 18.34; 95% CI, 5.41-31.27). The LP/P carrier status was associated with a higher risk of heart failure (hazard ratio \[HR\], 2.68; 95% CI, 1.75-4.12) and conduction disease (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.25-2.83). Higher all-cause mortality risk was observed for non-Val142Ile LP/P variants (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.06-3.67). Thirteen participants (2.8%) with LP/P variants had diagnostic codes compatible with cardiac or neurologic amyloidosis. Variants of unknown significance were not associated with outcomes.

**Conclusions and Relevance**  This study found that approximately 1 in 1000 UKB participants were LP/P _TTR_ variant carriers, exceeding previously reported prevalence. The findings emphasize the need for clinical vigilance in identifying individuals at risk of developing vATTR and associated poor outcomes.

**View from the Ground, by Dr Honor Merriman**

GPs’ roles have changed enormously over the past few years. Having worked in the same practice for over 40 years, I perhaps see things from a different perspective, but I don’t think I am alone in this. I am a mentor to a few GPs in the national New to Practice Programme, and those I meet feel the same. The responsibility for making clinical decisions rests with GPs despite increasing involvement from other healthcare professionals. These practitioners have differing skill sets and lead on clinical areas that are rapidly changing;1,2 at present, these changes are not always shared with GPs. Better communication and understanding of any changes will enable more effective collaboration in primary care, facilitating provision of a quality service for patients—even if the way primary care does this has changed.1

### GPs as the Backstop 

One example of GPs charting unfamiliar territory when supporting the patients of another healthcare professional is evident in the management of diabetes. Many patients with diabetes are now managed by specialist diabetes nurses;3 however, when one of these patients has a problem and the nurse is unavailable, a GP is often asked to solve the problem. For significantly unwell patients, hospital admission is the best option, but for most queries, knowledge of current best practice in diabetes is needed. Fortunately, the regular general updates most GPs do with medical education providers such as NB Medical Education or Red Whale provide most of the answers.4,5

Similarly, a pregnant patient may need medical advice the same day, but has been unable to contact the midwife team, so it falls to the GP. Some problems are not pregnancy related, such as respiratory infections. Others can present problems, such as aching calves with no abnormality found on examination. Testing the patient’s D-dimer level would not be helpful because it is raised in pregnancy anyway.6 Venous thromboembolism is more common in pregnant than nonpregnant women.7 GPs may feel unskilled, as midwife teams now look after most antenatal patients.8 Advice is on hand from the local obstetric unit—but again, the clinician with the least experience is the first to be contacted.

### The Fundamentals of Effective Collaboration

In well-developed practice teams, there is good communication, and complex problems are solved by adopting a multifaceted approach.1 So, how can primary care teams collaborate more effectively to achieve the best result?

Teams that work effectively together demonstrate a mixture of professional skills, mutual professional respect, and clear team communication. The King’s Fund has published a summary of how to achieve these elements of effective collaboration.1 The three main components are:1

Continue Reading Below

*   **a small number of meaningful objectives**—objectives that team members are equally responsible for, to create a sense of shared purpose, trust, and collective achievement
*   **clear roles and responsibilities among team members**—outlining what activities need to be done and by whom, to ensure that everything is completed and to clarify each member’s roles and strengths; this should be reviewed regularly
*   **reflection on how the team is working together**—this can be in any form (for example, away days or team ‘huddles’), to cover both the technical aspects of work as well as how people are feeling; it is important that everyone feels safe to freely express themselves regardless of their role.

### Improving Communication and Teamwork

Google’s 2-year research project into cultivating great teams found that the highest-performing teams had one thing in common—psychological safety, or the belief that members can speak up or make mistakes without retribution.9 This is an important goal that primary care team leaders should aim for, as people become more creative, resilient, and motivated when they feel safe.9

One way to improve communication is through huddles, which are short, frequent check-ins to discuss the day’s patients and tasks.1 Huddles can allow for the discussion of patient-specific issues and clarification of responsibilities.1

Furthermore, digital communication tools, such as email and video conferencing, are also critical, as each team member will need access to shared patient records and booking systems to view and share information easily when needed—for example, on home visits.1

Finally, the physical environmental also plays a role in supporting new teams to function. Shared working spaces are the default location when team members are not seeing a patient, and these spaces have many benefits, such as improving integration and team cohesion, enabling real-time communication in huddles, and facilitating information sharing between team members.1 The King’s Fund highlights that team members are more likely to be sensitive to one another’s problems and appreciate each other’s roles when they have this sort of contact with each other.1

### Ensuring Clinical Accountability and Supportive Management

Clinical supervision, appraisals, and learning and development opportunities are essential to ensure that all team members are held to professional standards and encouraged to reflect on their own practice.1

Clinical supervision and appraisals are essential requirements for all healthcare professionals. There are many effective models of clinical supervision, including one-to-one, group, or peer supervision. Clinical supervision should be developed by teams to meet their needs. Appraisals are a requirement in the NHS, and should be focused on a shared understanding of team goals, two-way communication, and setting goals for the future. In addition, all team members need to have the skills, knowledge, and experience to deliver effective care. Identifying the needs of team members and ensuring access to training and opportunities to develop is critical for all healthcare professionals to maintain their registration and stay up to date with current practice.1

The face of primary care is changing, and making sure that all team members stay on top of changes to their roles and responsibilities is important for fostering a harmonious and effective environment that encourages collaboration and enables provision of a superb service to patients. To those of you who are already doing all of this—well done!

Recent findings reveal that prenatal fish oil supplementation may significantly reduce the risk of childhood atopic dermatitis (AD) in children of mothers with specific genetic markers. This study analyzed data from a randomized clinical trial and highlighted that mothers with the COX1 _TT_ genotype experienced a lower risk of AD when supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids compared to those who did not receive the supplementation. **Key takeaway**: Consider genetic testing for expecting mothers as part of a tailored approach to AD prevention.

Full Text

Key Points**Question**  Is ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA; ie, fish oil) supplementation during pregnancy associated with reduced risk of childhood atopic dermatitis (AD) in mothers carrying specific cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) genotypes?

**Findings**  In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial including 635 mother-child pairs with 10-year follow-up, a reduced risk of childhood AD until age 10 years was found only for mothers carrying the COX1 _TT_ genotype who received n-3 LCPUFA supplements. There was increased AD risk among children of mothers with the _CC_ genotype and no association overall or for mothers carrying the _CT_ genotype.

**Meaning**  The findings support use of a personalized prevention strategy for reducing the burden of childhood AD by genotyping expecting mothers in early pregnancy and providing n-3 LCPUFA supplementation only to women carrying the COX1 _TT_ genotype.

Abstract

**Importance**  Eicosanoids have a pathophysiological role in atopic dermatitis (AD), but it is unknown whether this is affected by prenatal ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA; ie, fish oil) supplementation and genetic variations in the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) pathway.

**Objective**  To explore the association of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy with risk of childhood AD overall and by maternal COX1 genotype.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  This prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial included mother-child pairs from the Danish Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 birth cohort, with prospective follow-up until children were aged 10 years. In the trial, maternal and child COX1 genotypes were determined, and urinary eicosanoids were quantified when the child was 1 year of age. The present study was conducted from January 2019 to December 2021, and data were analyzed from January to September 2023.

**Intervention**  A total of 736 pregnant women at 24 weeks’ gestation were randomized 1:1 to 2.4 g of n-3 LCPUFA (fish oil) or placebo (olive oil) per day until 1 week post partum.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  Risk of childhood AD until age 10 years overall and by maternal COX1 genotype.

**Results**  At age 10 years, 635 children (91%; 363 \[57%\] female) completed the clinical follow-up, and these mother-child pairs were included in this study; 321 (51%) were in the intervention group and 314 (49%) in the control group. Pregnancy n-3 LCPUFA supplementation was associated with lower urinary thromboxane A2 metabolites at age 1 year (β, –0.46; 95% CI, –0.80 to –0.13; _P_ = .006), which was also associated with COX1 rs1330344 genotype (β per _C_ allele, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.20-0.73; _P_ = .001). Although neither n-3 LCPUFA supplementation (hazard ratio \[HR\], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.76-1.33; _P_ = .97) nor maternal COX1 genotype (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.74-1.19; _P_ = .60) was associated with risk of childhood AD until age 10 years, there was evidence of an interaction between these variables (_P_ < .001 for interaction). Among mothers with the _TT_ genotype, risk of AD was reduced in the n-3 LCPUFA group compared with the placebo group (390 mother-child pairs \[61%\]; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.98; _P_ = .04); there was no association for mothers with the _CT_ genotype (209 \[33%\]; HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.79-2.10; _P_ = .31), and risk was increased among offspring of mothers with the _CC_ genotype (37 \[6%\]; HR, 5.77; 95% CI, 1.63-20.47; _P_ = .007). There was a significant interaction between n-3 LCPUFA supplementation and child COX1 genotype and development of AD (_P_ = .002 for interaction).

**Conclusions and Relevance**  In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, the association of prenatal n-3 LCPUFA supplementation with risk of childhood AD varied by maternal COX1 genotype. The findings could be used to inform a personalized prevention strategy of providing supplementation only to pregnant individuals with the _TT_ genotype.
