UK startup Sava raises $8m to develop next-gen continuous glucose monitor
=========================================================================

Balderton backed the startup as it looks to take its device through clinical trials and scale manufacturing capabilities
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As patients and consumers spend more time — and money — on tech to help them monitor their health, a growing [group of startups](https://sifted.eu/articles/aware-amsterdam-lakestar-healthtech-news) are looking to cash in on the trend.

Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) — small devices that usually attach to a user's arm and measure blood sugar levels — have been made famous by London-based company Zoe, one of Europe’s [best funded D2C health techs](https://sifted.eu/articles/zoe-healthtech-cost-cutting-news). Today, fellow UK-based startup Sava is announcing an $8m seed round to develop the next generation of the devices.

The company is building a new type of CGM, which it says will be less invasive and cheaper than current devices and able to monitor a wider range of chronic conditions and biomarkers in the future.

It’s looking to take advantage of the “exploding” CGM market and the “massive greenfield opportunity” in the space, says cofounder and co-CEO Renato Circi.

The raise, led by Balderton Capital and Exor Ventures, takes Sava’s total funding to $13m. The startup will use the money to take its CGM through clinical trials and scale its manufacturing capability.

### **‘Future proofed’ CGM**

Currently, CGMs on the market use a single needle (about 6mm long) to pierce the skin and reach what’s known as interstitial fluid (ISF) — which is found in the spaces between cells and from which blood glucose levels can be measured.

Sava’s CGM also measures glucose levels in the ISF but with several smaller 1mm microneedles — which it calls “microsensors”. That approach comes with several benefits, says Circi.

One is user experience: people are put off by the prospect of putting a needle in their skin and Sava’s smaller microneedles are less intimidating, he argues.

There’s also cost. Manufacturing costs of current CGMs on the market mean that vendors sell the product for £50 for two weeks of monitoring — and only a “fraction of people” have access to them, says Circi. But, when the startup’s manufacturing capabilities are scaled, he hopes Sava will be able to make CGMs “up to 10 times” cheaper than they are currently.

Circi also says that, eventually, because Sava’s device has several sensing microneedles, it will be able to ""future proof"" its CGM so it can measure molecules other than glucose — something that current devices, which only use one needle, aren’t capable of doing.

Sava hasn’t decided which molecules it will expand into next, but Circi tells Sifted it could look at measuring things like ketones, urea, proteins, allergens or alcohol. These biomarkers could be used to analyse sports performance, for example, he adds.

### **A growing market**

CGMs were originally designed for diabetes patients to help them manage their condition, but have recently seen growing usage from consumers looking to keep more aware of their broader health. [Zoe](https://sifted.eu/articles/tim-spector-zoe-health), for example, uses CGMs to help build users’ personalised scores for thousands of foods on its app.

“We believe that D2C markets will be huge,” says Circi. “CGMs won’t just be diabetes, but which use cases will be successful we don’t know.”

It’s this rising awareness of CGMs that helped Sava raise its recent round, says Circi. “When we had conversations with investors three years ago, they were asking us: ‘what is a CGM?’. Over the last couple of years, it’s been ‘I’ve tried a CGM and I’ve seen how it works and there’s something we can do better with them’.”

There are also signs that healthcare providers could also be a fruitful market, says Circi, pointing to the UK’s NHS [making CGMs available](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/type-1-diabetes/managing-blood-glucose-levels/continuous-glucose-monitoring-cgm-and-flash/#:~:text=CGM%20or%20flash%20glucose%20monitoring,CGM%20or%20flash%20glucose%20monitoring.) to all type 1 diabetes patients in recent times.

### **What’s next**

While Sava’s tech isn’t novel — there have been [studies in recent years](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8949222/#:~:text=Each%20microneedle%20is%201%20mm,of%203%20%C3%97%204%20microneedles.) exploring using microneedles for CGM — “no-one has been able to crack it” and release a commercial product so far, says Circi.

That’s because it’s a “very difficult product to build”, says Circi, adding that it’s taken five years for the startup to get to this point and currently 35 of Sava’s 40-strong team are engineers — many of whom have PhDs.

Next up, Sava plans to launch clinical trials with 50 diabetes patients, following it recently gaining approval from the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The majority of the funds will be spent on developing the hardware for its second-generation CGM, which will be smaller than its first, as well as automating manufacturing capabilities to scale up production.

Sava also plans to go back out to fundraise again in the next 12 months, says Circi — as part of its plan to take its first product to market in the next two years.

“It costs tens of millions to take a product like this to market.”

Phase 2 data support the National Medical Products Administration’s approval of fulzerasib for those with KRAS G12C–mutated NSCLC in China.

Supporting data for the approval came from a phase 2 study (NCT05005234) assessing the safety and efficacy of fulzerasib for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring _KRAS_ G12C mutations following disease progression on standard therapy.

China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved fulzerasib (Dupert) as a treatment for adults with advanced _KRAS_ G12C–mutated non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy, according to a press release from the developer, Innovent Biologics, Inc.1

Fulzerasib—an investigational, orally active KRAS G12C inhibitor—was designed to covalently and irreversibly alter the cysteine residue of the KRAS G12C protein, which helps with targeting the GTP/GDP exchange involved in pathway activation. Based on results from prior preclinical cysteine selectivity studies, investigators hypothesized that treatment with fulzerasib may impede downstream signal pathways, consequently yielding tumor cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

Supporting data for the approval came from a phase 2 study (NCT05005234) assessing the safety and efficacy of fulzerasib for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring _KRAS_ G12C mutations following disease progression on standard therapy.

As of the data cutoff date of December 13, 2023, treatment with fulzerasib appeared to be tolerable while eliciting antitumor activity among 116 patients with NSCLC. Based on an independent radiology review committee (IRRC) assessment, the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 49.1% (95% CI, 39.7%-58.6%). Additionally, study treatment conferred a disease control rate (DCR) of 90.5% (95% CI, 83.7%-95.2%), while the median duration of response (DOR) was not reached. Data showed that the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.7 months (95% CI, 5.6-11.0) and that the median overall survival (OS) was not reached.

“KRAS has long been considered an 'undruggable' target despite being a common oncogenic driver mutation. The advent of KRAS G12C inhibitors has opened new avenues for precision medicine in cancers harboring this mutation,” Yi-Long Wu, MD, a professor from Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute of Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, said in the press release.1 “We are proud to be part of the clinical research and development of \[fulzerasib\], the first KRAS G12C inhibitor approved in China. We hope that \[fulzerasib\] will soon benefit more patients with advanced lung cancer harboring _KRAS_ G12C mutations, driving the progress of precision treatment for lung cancer.”

In the phase 2 portion of this open-label, multi-center study, investigators assessed the efficacy of fulzerasib in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring _KRAS_ G12C mutations.2 Those with _KRAS_ G12C–mutated colorectal cancer (CRC) and other tumors were also assessed during the phase 1b portion of the study. Patients received fulzerasib as an oral tablet formulation.

The trial’s primary end points included adverse effect (AEs) and dose-limiting toxicities in phase 1a, ORR per RECIST v1.1 criteria in phase 1b, and ORR per IRRC evaluation in phase 2. Secondary end points across all phases of the study included pharmacokinetics, DCR, DOR, time to response, PFS, and OS.

Patients 18 years and older with at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1 guidelines and an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible for enrollment on the trial. Having a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks was another requirement for study entry.

Those with significant cardiovascular system disease, unstable brain metastases, or the presence of serious acute or chronic infections were ineligible for enrollment. Additionally, having significant gastrointestinal diseases such as intractable hiccups, nausea, vomiting, or cirrhosis was also grounds for exclusion from the trial.

“Patients with advanced NSCLC harboring _KRAS_ G12C mutations have limited treatment options, with traditional chemotherapy offering minimal benefits. We are excited that \[fulzerasib\] has become the first KRAS G12C inhibitor approved in China, marking the beginning of a new era in targeted therapy for _KRAS_ mutations,” Hui Zhou, PhD, senior vice president at Innovent, concluded.1

The EF-backed startup building a novel device for the anal sex market
=====================================================================

London-based Polari Group has raised a pre-seed round ahead of a planned product release in September 2025
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When founder Anna Vybornova was on the fundraising roadshow, some investors she pitched to abruptly ended the meeting after minutes of talking about her London-based startup, Polari Group.

That’s because the company is developing a novel device which it says can replace douching before anal sex. And despite the discomfort of some potential backers — today it’s announcing a $539k raise. The money comes from VC Chasing Rainbows, Ada Ventures' angel programme, angel network Ventures Together and family office Little Green Bamboo Capital.

According to Dealroom data, it’s the first European startup to raise funds to develop a product specifically around anal sex. The company is developing a ball-shaped device designed to be inserted into the rectum before anal sex, to prevent what it calls “faecal accidents”.

Raising money for such a product is no mean feat in a world where it’s _very_ difficult to raise money for any sextech startup.

Vice clauses (restrictions set by LPs on where their money can be invested that often cover things like tobacco, guns — and sex) as well as conservative investor stigma [block](https://sifted.eu/articles/sextech-fundraising) many potential backers from considering these ideas. Just seven sextech companies have raised in 2024 so far and across the two previous years only 20 convinced investors to part with their cash.

Polari does split the opinion of investors, says cofounder and CEO Anna Vybornova. “People love what we do or people are disgusted and find it off-putting.""

But these disgusted investors might be missing out on a big opportunity.

A 2013 study of more than 1k gay men in Belgium found that [two thirds](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25356292/) had had anal sex in the previous four weeks and one 2016 survey found that a [third of heterosexual people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4949144/) in the US had in the previous year. Using figures from those studies, Polari estimates that 2.8bn anal sex acts happen yearly across the UK, US and Europe.

Founded in 2023 during one of London-founded company builder [Entrepreneur First](https://sifted.eu/articles/entrepreneur-first-us-demo-day)’s cohorts, Polari will use the fresh funds to finalise the design of its device and grow its team.

### **An alternative to douching**

Preparing for anal sex can be time consuming for those that choose to douche — the process of flushing the rectum with water to clean it. NHS [guidelines](https://www.sexualhealth.cnwl.nhs.uk/media/1050/anal.pdf) also recommend against douching, because it can damage the body’s natural internal lining and protective mucus.

Because of this, doctors don’t know how to talk about the process with patients, says Polari cofounder and CTO Henry Blest.

It means there’s very little advice available and some people end up engaging in “dangerous” douching practices, he tells Sifted. “Medicine won’t engage with anal douching — but the \[LGBTQ+\] community won’t stop doing it because they don’t want to have a faecal accident during sex.”

But Polari’s ball-shaped device is designed to be inserted into the rectum before anal sex to prevent exactly that. While the startup can’t share how exactly the device works or design specifics, as it's worried about others copying the idea before it's able to release a product, Vybornova says it's single use.

The device is made from a “novel material” and is in the final stages of design, she tells Sifted. “We have a product that works in models.”

Those, Vybornova adds, are models of the rectum and penis, which have allowed the startup to study how faeces moves during anal sex.

While she says Polari’s device doesn’t need to go through clinical trials before its planned launch in the UK in September 2025 as it’s a consumer product, it does need to meet the ISO standard (an international set of standards covering technology and manufacturing) for sex toys — which dictates that a product must be designed in certain ways to avoid harm to the end user.

It also needs to go through further testing, on things like safety and quality, which will be carried out by an independent contract manufacturing organisation (CMO).

### **The future**

The fresh funding will be spent on finalising the product design in the lab, beginning to take it through regulatory testing and growing the team.

There’s currently one other Polari employee alongside Blest and Vybornova — a chief of staff — and the startup wants to grow the team to between 7-10 people by the time it launches the device. Roles it’s hiring for will include a head of quality and several lab staff.

Polari cofounders Anna Vybornova and Henry Blest

Polari will also look to get back on the fundraising roadshow sometime between this September and January 2024. It’ll look to raise a “couple of million” which will allow it to release and scale its device as a direct-to-consumer product.

That will involve partnering with a manufacturer to mass produce the device, alongside expanding sales and marketing functions and conducting further regulatory testing.

Further down the line, the startup will look into selling the device white label to other sexual health product providers — alongside developing a “a larger line of proprietary products for anal health and pleasure”, says Blest.

But first there’s the matter of convincing often prudish investors to stump up more cash ahead of the first product launch.

The idea is to raise from VCs rather than angels, but because of the difficulty convincing that group to part with funds, Vybornova says Polari will also target high net worth individuals and family offices.

“We need to be creative. We don’t operate with the same playbook as a B2B SaaS.”

2024-08-28 07:02:19,"🌟 Are we doing enough to keep our patients on statins? A recent systematic review has painted a concerning picture about the risks associated with discontinuing statin therapy. It found that the first year following statin discontinuation presents a significantly increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. 

In an analysis that included over 4 million participants, the review showed that statin discontinuation rates ranged dramatically, from 0.8% to an alarming 70.5%, with certain demographics such as males, non-Whites, and those without insurance being more likely to stop their medication. The authors stress the importance of addressing modifiable factors like smoking and healthcare access to help improve adherence. 

One of the headline statistics is that the risk of all-cause mortality increased by 36% in those who discontinued statins within the first year. This underlines the urgency of our role in monitoring and supporting patients on statin therapy, especially those at risk of discontinuation.

As healthcare professionals, how can we better engage with our patients to encourage adherence to their prescribed therapy? Let’s discuss strategies that have worked in your practice!

Cardiovascular Event Risk Increases in Year After Statin Discontinuation
========================================================================

A systematic review identified a notable link between the first year of statin discontinuation and the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

A recent systematic review of available literature reported an elevated rate of statin discontinuation and a subsequently increased risk of [adverse cardiovascular outcomes](https://www.hcplive.com/clinical/cardiology) within the first year of stopping the medication.1

The analysis, involving more than 4 million participants, revealed the rate of statin discontinuation within the first year of initiation ranged from 0.8% to 70.5%, with patient factors including male sex, non-White descent, and lack of prescription insurance linked to higher discontinuation rates.

“These factors, especially modifiable factors such as smoking and lack of insurance coverage, must be addressed, and patients at risk of discontinuation should be regularly assessed for adherence,” wrote the investigative team, led by Yaw B. Owusu, PharmD, MSc, department of clinical pharmacy and practice, college of pharmacy, QU Health, Qatar University.

In 2013, clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) on the management of blood cholesterol to lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk were updated to focus on lifestyle changes and expand the eligibility of statin therapy.2

Statin use significantly increased in subsequent years, reflecting its use as a first-line pharmacotherapy for primary and secondary ASCVD prevention.3 However, a notable amount of statin users often discontinue the medication, with significant variation by setting, population, and country of study.

Causes of discontinuation can range from socioeconomic issues to low health literature or side effects related to statin use. In this systematic review, Owusu and colleagues searched published literature to determine the discontinuation rate of statins within the first year of initiation and the involved risk factors, and estimate the risk of cardiovascular events in this period.1

From inception to December 2022, the team searched PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar to identify relevant studies of patients with or at risk of CV events who discontinued statin therapy. Overall, the analysis included 52 studies, predominantly cohort studies (n = 38), with a total of 4,277,061 participants.

Most studies (n = 44) included individuals who had newly started statin therapy. Across the studies, the highest mean age was 82.5 years, while the lowest mean age was 52.5 years. A total of 39 studies included participants who received statins for primary and secondary prevention.

Upon analysis, the prevalence of statin discontinuation within the first year of initiation ranged from 0.8% to 70.5%. Among 4 studies evaluating the difference in discontinuation between primary and secondary prevention, a higher discontinuation rate was observed in the primary prevention group.

Multiple sociodemographic factors were linked to a higher likelihood of statin discontinuation, including male sex, non-White ethnicity, smoking status, and having no insurance. A lower likelihood of statin discontinuation was identified in patients with ASCVD who received secondary prevention statin therapy and those with polypharmacy.

Owusu and colleagues noted age exhibited a varied and mixed association with statin discontinuation across age groups. Among 5 studies reporting the cardiovascular risk of statin discontinuation, the team identified a significantly elevated risk of 1-year all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio \[aHR\], 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08–1.70; _P_ = .008).

In their summary, Owusu and colleagues pointed to the need for further study to determine the specific causes of statin discontinuation and the adverse consequences of poor adherence on an individual’s health.

“Some consequences of statin discontinuation, such as the recurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events, are serious and require prompt intervention to improve adherence and improve sequelae,” they wrote.
