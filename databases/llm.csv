August 30, 2024

3 min read

Key takeaways:

* When a patient made a critical error in inhalation technique and/or had insufficient peak inspiratory flow, they had inhaler misuse.
* In the assessed study population, 82.3% used a minimum of one misused inhaler.

Inhaler misuse was high in hospitalized patients with COPD, with 69.4% of all inhalers at admission found to be misused, according to results published in _Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases: Journal of the COPD Foundation_.

‚ÄúAs a hospital physician, these findings prompt me to systematically evaluate the inhalers used by COPD patients, regardless of their reason for hospitalization,‚Äù Ga—ël Grandmaison, MD, assistant physician in internal medicine at University and Hospital of Fribourg in Switzerland, told Healio.

Data were derived from Grandmaison G, et al. _Chronic Obstr Pulm Dis._ 2024;doi:10.15326/jcopdf.2024.0505.

‚ÄúIn response to these findings, we have implemented a systematic and standardized assessment of inhaler use among our patients, aiming to correct inhalation techniques or replace the inhaler if necessary,‚Äù Grandmaison continued. ‚Äú[This intervention](https://smw.ch/index.php/smw/article/view/3394/5882) has significantly reduced the number of improperly used inhalers at hospital discharge.‚Äù

In a cross-sectional study, Grandmaison and colleagues evaluated 96 patients (mean age, 71.6 years; 63% men) in the internal medicine division of Fribourg Hospital with a diagnosis of COPD to find out how many patients in this population misuse inhalers via physiotherapist assessments and the In-Check Dial G16 (Alliance Tech Medical) over 9 months.

Researchers cited inhaler misuse when a patient made a critical error in inhalation technique and/or had insufficient peak inspiratory flow (PIF).

The total cohort had 160 inhalers, and nearly 70% (111 inhalers) had been misused. In the entire study population, 82.3% of patients used a minimum of one misused inhaler.

‚ÄúNumerous studies have highlighted the significant issue of improper inhaler use in outpatient settings,‚Äù Grandmaison said. ‚ÄúOur study confirms that this problem is also widespread.‚Äù

A critical error in inhalation technique was behind more instances of inhaler misuse than insufficient PIF (105 inhalers; 65.6% vs. 22 inhalers; 13.8%), and this was also reflected in the proportions of patients who used a minimum of one inhaler with a critical error (81.3%) and had insufficient PIF (21.9%).

In an effort to determine if targeted teaching can change the prevalence of inhaler misuse, researchers had physiotherapists carry out up to three teaching sessions and reassessed the number of inhalers with critical errors after each one.

With each additional session, fewer inhalers had been used with critical errors (one session, 33 inhalers; two sessions, 15 inhalers; three sessions, nine inhalers).

Five patients had cognitive disorders that inhibited them from reaching an adequate inhalation technique, according to researchers. A lack of coordination between inhaler activation and inspiration (n = 4) was another factor preventing adequate inhalation technique, followed by fine motor disorders and the inability to hold one‚Äôs breath sufficiently (each n = 2).

Researchers further assessed how many inhalers were unsuitable, meaning they ‚Äúcannot be used optimally, either because of an insufficient PIF or because of an inability to use an inhaler optimally despite specific teaching,‚Äù and found 27 (16.9%). Use of at least one unsuitable inhaler was noted in 25% of the study population.

‚ÄúSuboptimal inhaler use is associated with poor disease control, more frequent hospitalizations and increased costs,‚Äù Grandmaison told Healio. ‚ÄúThe prevalence of improperly-used inhalers is alarming, and strategies to address this issue are urgently needed.‚Äù

Among those hospitalized with a COPD exacerbation, 62.2% of the inhalers in this subgroup had been misused, whereas in the group of those hospitalized without an exacerbation, 85.7% of inhalers had been misused.

Additionally, those hospitalized for a respiratory compliant misused 65.9% of the inhalers in this subgroup, which was lower than the 82.4% of misused inhalers in the group not hospitalized for a respiratory compliant.

‚ÄúThese results underscore the critical importance of assessing inhalation technique and providing appropriate therapeutic education,‚Äù Grandmaison told Healio. ‚ÄúThey also highlight the need to evaluate a patient‚Äôs inspiratory capacity and ensure that the chosen inhaler matches their specific needs.‚Äù

With both this study and the study mentioned above on the intervention that lowered the number of improperly used inhalers at discharge completed, Grandmaison plans to continue researching the intervention.

‚ÄúThe next step is to evaluate the impact of such an intervention on symptom control and disease progression,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAdditionally, our goal is to adapt the strategy developed in our department for use in outpatient care.‚Äù

#Cardiology #Geriatrics #ClinicalTrials #PatientSafety #HealthOutcomes #MedicalResearch","Groundbreaking lipid profiling uncovers how plant-based fats dramatically enhance heart and metabolic health, paving the way for precise dietary interventions.

A recent research briefing published in the journal _Nature Medicine_ reported associations between dietary fat quality and cardiometabolic risk.

The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks the evidence for the health benefits of substituting specific nutrients for others (e.g., mono- and poly-unsaturated fats for saturated fat) as low to moderate. According to the WHO, the current dietary guidelines advocating for reduced consumption of saturated fats are based on evidence of moderate certainty but remain a topic of ongoing debate.

Besides, the main drawbacks of existing intervention trials assessing different dietary fat types are shorter durations and reliance on indirect measures, e.g., cholesterol, instead of clinical endpoints (incident type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular events). Furthermore, observational studies evaluating the health outcomes of lower saturated fat intake are prone to confounding and often do not report the effects of specific nutrient substitutions.

The study and findings

In the present briefing, researchers utilized extensive blood fat composition profiling in different types of studies and observed associations between dietary fat quality and cardiometabolic risks. They combined data from dietary intervention studies that precisely controlled the types and sources of dietary fats with long-term observational studies that monitored disease occurrence over extended periods.

The researchers conducted extensive blood lipid profiling and developed/validated a multi-lipid score (MLS). The score reflected the effects of an intervention on the concentrations of 45 lipid metabolites, serving as a surrogate for metabolic adaptation to dietary fat changes. This approach allowed them to evaluate the implications of altering dietary fat quality on cardiometabolic health more precisely. The team leveraged the MLS to assess the implications of changes in the quality of dietary fats on cardiometabolic health in population studies.

Further, subgroup-specific effects were analyzed in a long-term intervention trial. The differences in MLS, which aligned with the impact of substituting saturated dairy fat with plant-based unsaturated fat, were associated with a significantly lower incidence of type 2 diabetes (in a dietary intervention trial) and cardiovascular disease (in prospective cohort studies).

Persons with initially worse MLS exhibited a stronger decrease in diabetes risk when on a Mediterranean diet rich in plant-based unsaturated fats than those with favorable MLS. This finding highlights the importance of the initial metabolic state in determining the effectiveness of dietary interventions. Substituting saturated fats from dairy products, e.g., butter, with plant-based unsaturated fats could result in substantially reduced cardiometabolic risks.

Conclusions

The study contributes important evidence supporting the current guidelines on the optimal source and quality of dietary fat but also underscores ongoing debates and limitations in the existing evidence base. The researchers addressed previous limitations of evidence underlying these guidelines by integrating randomized controlled trials and observational studies. The findings highlight the cardiometabolic benefits of replacing saturated fat from dairy products with unsaturated fat from plant products.

The authors said, ‚ÄúThe enthusiasm our work has generated encourages us to apply omics profiles for integrating data from cohorts and trials to other nutrition research questions.‚Äù However, they cautioned that their multi-study strategy is not without limitations.

While this multi-study approach addressed previous research biases, the team did not perform independent studies to establish thresholds for decision-making, examine cost-effectiveness, and validate absolute effect sizes on all metabolites. However, they cautioned that their multi-study strategy is not without limitations.

Additionally, the observed associations need validation in diverse racial and ethnic groups, as the study populations were primarily of European descent. Overall, the findings open avenues for more precise targeted interventions of dietary fat quality through lipid profiling. However, the application of lipidomics scores for dietary risk prevention requires further validation in future randomized controlled trials, particularly in more diverse populations.

===============================================================================

September 4, 2024

By Joshua Fitch, Senior Editor

Alan Percy, MD, discussed what the FDA approval of trofinetide (Daybue) has meant to patients with Rett syndrome aged 2 years and older.

Alan Percy, MD, Professor of Pediatrics, Neurology, Neurobiology, Genetics, and Psychology at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and the lead author for the LILAC-1 and LILAC-2 studies, recently discussed significant advancements in the treatment of Rett syndrome, highlighting the FDA approval of trofinetide (Daybue; Acadia Pharmaceuticals), approved on March 13, 2023. Percy also discussed the recent long-term safety data for trofinetide, based on a pair of open-label extension studies LILAC-1 and LILAC-2.

""Actually, it's quite interesting that while there is great enthusiasm among parents of children, the survival in Rett syndrome is quite long. So average survival is over age 50. So, many adult women with Rett syndrome are also taking this medication,"" Percy explained, noting the trofinetide approval marked a significant milestone in the direct management of Rett syndrome symptoms.

Percy emphasized the groundbreaking nature of this treatment, noting that ""this was the first product that was ever has been developed and approved by the FDA for direct treatment of the signs or symptoms of Rett syndrome. Other medications we use are for symptomatic care, but nothing has been available previously to direct at the basic underpinnings of Rett syndrome.""

The pivotal trial for this treatment, known as the LAVENDER trial, was a ""double-blind, placebo-controlled study lasting 12 weeks,"" Percy explained. The trial utilized the Rett Syndrome Behavioral Questionnaire (RSBQ) and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) as primary endpoints to measure the treatment's effectiveness. ""What is quite remarkable is at the end of the first pivotal trial, 12 weeks both the RSBQ and the CGI-I showed improvement.""

LILAC-1 was a 40-week, open-label extension of the LAVENDER trail and evaluated safety and efficacy of trofinetide in patients with Rett syndrome aged 5 to 21 years. LILAC-2 was a 32-month open-label extension evaluating trofinetide in females aged 5 to 22 years who had completed LILAC-1, according to Acadia Pharmaceuticals.

The most common side effects in the trials were diarrhea and vomiting.

Percy acknowledged that while the treatment shows significant promise, it is not without challenges. ""I think it is important to mention that diarrhea can be a substantial problem, and there may be individuals who have to stop the treatment simply because the diarrhea is not manageable."" However, he pointed out that strategies have been developed over time to manage this side effect more effectively. ""We start at 50% of the recommended weight-based dose, and we gradually increase to the point of maximum tolerability.""

‚ÄúWe are exceptionally proud to share these results, which we believe validate VAX-31‚Äôs potential as a best-in-class pneumococcal vaccine capable of raising the bar for immunogenicity standards,‚Äù said Jim Wassil, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Vaxcyte. ‚ÄúThe public health community continues to highlight the need for broader-protection vaccines to prevent IPD, which is associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and meningitis. To address this need, VAX-31 was designed to increase coverage to more than 95% of IPD circulating in adults 50 and older in the United States, with the potential to provide significantly greater coverage relative to today‚Äôs standard-of-care adult PCVs.‚Äù1

### Main Takeaways

1.  Vaxcyte‚Äôs VAX-31 vaccine showed strong immune responses and was well tolerated in a Phase 1/2 study of 1,015 adults aged 50 and older.
2.  VAX-31 met or exceeded immunogenicity standards for all 31 serotypes and demonstrated superior responses compared to Prevnar 20 for several serotypes.
3.  Vaxcyte plans to advance VAX-31 to a Phase 3 trial by mid-2025 and initiate a Phase 2 infant study to offer broader protection against pneumococcal disease.

The randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding study compared three dosage levels of VAX-31 to PCV20, assessing its safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity over six months. Results showed that VAX-31 at the high and middle doses met non-inferiority criteria for all 20 common serotypes with PCV20, and demonstrated statistically superior immune responses for several serotypes. The vaccine also met superiority criteria for 11 additional serotypes unique to VAX-31.

[Back in February](https://www.contagionlive.com/view/vaxcyte-completes-enrollment-for-its-phase-1-2-trial-for-innovative-pneumococcal-vaccine-vax-31), Vaxcyte completed enrollment for the Phase 1/2 trial of VAX-31, a 31-valent PCV designed to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding study, which involves 1,015 participants, is evaluating three dosage levels of VAX-31 compared to PCV20.

Streptococcus pneumoniae causes PD, leads to severe infections such as meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia. It results in around 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the US The World Health Organization and the CDC classify Streptococcus pneumoniae as a top antibiotic-resistant threat. It is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in children under five and causes over 50% of bacterial meningitis cases in the US The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains highlights the urgent need for a more effective vaccine.

Looking ahead, Vaxcyte plans to advance VAX-31 into a Phase 3 program, with a pivotal non-inferiority study set to begin by mid-2025. Additionally, a Phase 2 study of VAX-31 in infants is planned for early 2025. VAX-31 aims to provide broader protection against pneumococcal disease, potentially covering more than 95% of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) strains in adults. As a novel 31-valent PCV, it represents a significant advancement in pneumococcal vaccination, seeking to enhance coverage and efficacy beyond current standard vaccines.

*   **The FDA has approved the FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx as companion diagnostics for the combination of olaparib (Lynparza) and abiraterone (Zytiga) with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with _BRCA_\-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).**
*   **This approval follows 2 previous approvals of the FoundationOne CDx as companion diagnostics for olaparib in mCRPC.**
*   **The availability of tissue- and liquid-based diagnostic tools provides greater access to genomic testing for patients.**

The FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx have been approved by the FDA for companion use with olaparib, abiraterone, and prednisone or prednisolone in patients with _BRCA_\-mutated mCRPC.1

‚ÄúThis approval reinforces the importance of testing for genomic mutations at metastatic diagnosis to help guide treatment decisions,‚Äù said Mia Levy, MD, PhD, chief medical officer at Foundation Medicine, in a press release. ‚ÄúOur high-quality tissue and liquid biopsy companion diagnostic tests will allow more patients to access genomic testing, regardless of specimen type, and will simplify complex decisions by generating the best information to enable better decision-making. There is a critical unmet need for first-line treatment options for patients with _BRCA_\-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and this combination therapy is an important advancement.‚Äù

This approval marks Foundation Medicine‚Äôs seventh FDA-approved companion diagnostic in prostate cancer. In May 2020, the FDA approved the FoundationOne CDx in patients with homologous recombination repair gene-mutated mCRPC who had progressed following treatment with enzalutamide (Xtandi) or abiraterone.2 In November 2020, the [**Liquid CDx was approved as a companion diagnostic**](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/foundationone-liquid-cdx-receives-expanded-fda-indication-in-metastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer) for olaparib to identify patients with mCRPC harboring _BRCA1, BRCA2_, or _ATM_ alterations.3

The FoundationOne companion diagnostics can analyze over 300 cancer-related genes using either blood or tissue samples. The approval of both tissue- and blood-based diagnostic tools provides greater access and flexibility for patients to benefit from genomic testing, particularly with the poor prognosis associated with _BRCA_\-mutated mCRPC.1

‚ÄúThis is an important milestone for men with aggressive prostate cancer,‚Äù said Courtney Bugler, president and chief executive officer of ZERO Prostate Cancer, in the press release. ‚ÄúBiomarker testing is an important tool for patients and families to help facilitate personalized treatment decision making, and we applaud Foundation Medicine for these additional companion diagnostic indications.‚Äù
