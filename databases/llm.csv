2024-09-10 09:20:00,2024-09-11 01:41:20,"ü©∫ Are we overlooking potential viral triggers in MS development? A recent Swedish study suggests an intriguing link between rubella infection and an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) for unvaccinated individuals.

- KEY FINDINGS: The study found that having antibodies against the rubella virus correlated with a higher MS risk among those who were unvaccinated. This could imply that rubella may act as a risk factor for the disease, providing support for the viral trigger hypothesis in MS.
- STUDY INSIGHTS: Conducted on blood samples from 670 MS patients and matched controls, the research revealed that 93.7% of MS patients had anti-E1 antibodies, compared to 88.5% of healthy controls. Notably, unvaccinated MS patients were found to be four times more likely to have these antibodies compared to their unvaccinated counterparts.
- MECHANISM AT PLAY: The researchers propose that ‚Äúmolecular mimicry,‚Äù where the immune response against the rubella virus may inadvertently target similar human molecules, could explain this increased risk. The rubella virus shares protein similarities with myelin proteins essential in nerve function.

While these findings are promising, the authors urge caution due to possible false negatives in serological testing and the limited variable assessment of past vaccination statuses. As we reconsider MS risk factors, this emphasizes the need for further studies to validate these claims and deepen our understanding of viral implications in neurodegenerative diseases. 

What does this mean for your clinical practice? Are there additional screenings for viral infections that should be implemented for at-risk populations? ü§î

===============

Rubella infection may increase MS risk in unvaccinated people
=============================================================

Having antibodies against the rubella virus is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) in unvaccinated people, a Swedish study suggests.

The findings show a rubella infection may be a risk factor for MS, reinforcing the hypothesis that certain viral infections may trigger the misleading immune response that drives MS.

‚ÄúTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between [rubella virus] and MS in pre-¬≠MS samples,‚Äù wrote the researchers, who said additional studies will be needed to confirm the association between rubella infection and MS.

The study, ‚Äú[Rubella virus seropositivity after infection or vaccination as a risk factor for multiple sclerosis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.16387),‚Äù was published in the _European Journal of Neurology._

[MS is caused](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/) by an erroneous immune response that damages healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord. The reason for the immune response isn‚Äôt fully understood, but evidence suggests viral infections may be risk factors. Infection with the [Epstein-Barr virus](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/) (EBV), in particular, is one of the strongest risk factors for the neurodegenerative condition and some studies have found an association between MS and the human herpesvirus-6A. Also, up to 78% of MS patients have antibodies against measles, varicella zoster, and rubella viruses in their spinal fluid.

It‚Äôs believed that, due to some similarities between viral and human molecules, the immune system may mistakenly attack nerve cells when trying to fight a viral infection. This ‚Äúmolecular mimicry‚Äù is one proposed mechanism that may explain the association between viruses and a greater risk of MS.

The rubella virus has several proteins that share similarities with human proteins. One protein from its envelope, called E2, is similar to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), an essential protein in [myelin](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/), the fatty coating that covers nerve cells and target of immune responses in MS.

These similarities raise the possibility of a connection between the rubella virus, the immune response against it, and developing MS.

Researchers in Sweden compared blood samples from MS patients and controls collected before the neurological disease‚Äôs onset to determine if people who developed MS had signs of a previous rubella infection ‚Äî determined through the presence of anti-rubella antibodies ‚Äî before their diagnosis.

‚ÄúWith samples from both the pre-¬≠vaccination era and through the different stages of rubella vaccination in Sweden, we explored a unique opportunity to study [the rubella virus] in the field of MS,‚Äù the researchers wrote.

The study included blood samples from 670 MS patients and 670 matched controls. In both groups, female patients represented the majority (84%) and the median age was 25.

The researchers tested the samples for the presence of antibodies (seropositivity) that targeted the rubella E1 protein, which the virus uses to infect human cells, and their reactivity. More MS patients (93.7%) had anti-E1 antibodies than healthy controls (88.5%), data showed.

When patients and controls were divided based on their rubella vaccination status, seropositivity was only significantly higher in MS patients than controls in unvaccinated people, in whom the presence of antibodies indicates a previous rubella infection. After adjusting for factors such as antibodies against other viruses and vitamin D levels, unvaccinated MS patients were four times more likely to have rubella antibodies than unvaccinated controls. No significant differences were observed in vaccinated patients after accounting for the same factors.

The presence of antibodies in ‚Äúunvaccinated subjects (i.e., representing rubella infection) was associated with a higher risk of developing MS,‚Äù the researchers wrote. ‚ÄúMolecular mimicry is an attractive hypothesis for a possible mechanism behind these findings.‚Äù

The researchers advised caution when interpreting their findings, mainly because the test they used to determine seropositivity can have a lot of false negatives. Also, most of the participants received the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, adding variables that weren‚Äôt evaluated in the study.

‚ÄúFurther serological and epidemiological studies are needed to support our findings,‚Äù they wrote.",gpt-4o-mini,IDkcoKdjUueJWt2wF5MB

Regeneron is the second pharma group to sign up for access to data from a remote study run by health technology firm Koneksa that is exploring the use of digital biomarkers to track patients with Parkinson's disease.

The LEARNS trial ‚Äì which started earlier this year ‚Äì is using smartphone and wearable technologies to monitor disease progression in Parkinson's patients and find ways to use digital biomarkers in the development of disease-modifying therapies.

Regeneron has become a member of the data syndication programme for LEARNS, joining MSD/Merck & Co, which signed up in March, and will have real-time access to data and results from the study. Those can be used for ""natural history analysis, trial design, cohort formation, and data analysis,"" according to the partners.

Quantitative tools for measuring progression are lacking in Parkinson's and other neurological disorders, with clinicians relying on subjective measures that make it harder to monitor patients, particularly as the rate of symptom decline fluctuates and varies wildly between individuals with the disease.

LEARNS is set to enrol up to 70 participants with Parkinson's who will be followed for 12 months, with first results expected next year. It uses the Koneksa neuroscience toolkit, which combines iPhone-based active assessments and passive monitoring using a wrist-worn wearable.

""Detecting the earliest signs of Parkinson's disease and establishing the necessary evidence of validity for new measures are critical needs within the healthcare community,"" said Chris Benko, Koneksa's chief executive.

""Our goal is to bring together biotech and pharma companies with real-time data sharing and analysis to expedite the validation and adoption of digital measures to unlock more data insights in clinical trials,"" he added.

Other projects looking at digital biomarkers for Parkinson's include the crowd-sourced DREAM Challenge, which saw 40 research teams from around the world contribute ways to process accelerometer and gyroscope data from consumer wearable devices that can be used to track muscle tremor, dyskinesia, and bradykinesia - three prominent symptoms of the disease.

Regeneron's pipeline doesn't currently include a clinical-stage treatment for Parkinson's, but it is working on drugs for other neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

""At Regeneron, we believe that digital biomarkers have the potential to improve the development of novel therapeutics, and collaboration helps make this a reality,"" said the company's head of clinical development for genetic diseases, Gary Herman.

STOCKHOLM, Sept. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Diamyd Medical will pursue an accelerated approval pathway in the U.S. for its antigen-specific immunotherapy, Diamyd¬Æ (rhGAD65/alum), aimed at preserving endogenous insulin production in patients with Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes. An earlier interim study readout from the ongoing Phase 3 trial, DIAGNODE-3, is planned to serve as the basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) under the accelerated approval pathway. Results from the interim readout are expected around March 2026.

""We are committed to working at full speed with our partners and in close dialogue with the FDA to seize this unprecedented opportunity of making Diamyd¬Æ available to patients as quickly as possible,"" says Ulf Hannelius, CEO of Diamyd Medical. ""The earlier readout from the DIAGNODE-3 trial represents a critical step in this process and our confidence in Diamyd¬Æ's disease-modifying benefits is boosted by the positive outcome of the recently announced futility analysis. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to ensure that all necessary regulatory requirements are met.""

Diamyd Medical recently announced Fast track designation in the U.S. for Diamyd¬Æ, and that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has acknowledged that accelerated approval could be sought based on a demonstration of significant treatment-related benefits on C-peptide levels, a measure of endogenous insulin production, in response to Diamyd¬Æ administration. The FDA's Accelerated approval program allows drugs for serious conditions that fills an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. Using a surrogate endpoint allows the FDA the potential to approve these drugs faster.

To prepare the BLA under the FDA's Accelerated Approval Program, Diamyd Medical plans to conduct an interim study readout, including efficacy data from approximately 170 participants who have completed their 15-month assessment and safety data from additional individuals enrolled in the DIAGNODE-3 trial. The primary endpoint for this analysis will be C-peptide, a surrogate endpoint now recognized by the FDA as reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Following the interim readout, the DIAGNODE-3 trial will continue to follow all enrolled patients until the 24-month end-of-study assessment. To date, 148 patients have been randomized in DIAGNODE-3. The results of the interim study readout are expected around March 2026, the exact time depending on the final number of participants to be included in the readout, followed by submission of a BLA under the accelerated approval pathway.

The DIAGNODE-3 trial, which is being conducted in eight European countries and the United States, is expected to fully recruit approximately 330 patients by the end of 2025, and all patients are expected to be fully treated before the time the earlier readout is to be performed. The trial focuses on recently diagnosed patients with Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes carrying the HLA DR3-DQ2 genotype; a subgroup of approximately 40% of Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes patients that has been shown to respond to Diamyd¬Æ in previous trials.

**About Diamyd Medical**

- Welireg is now an option specifically for treating VHL-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), brain and spinal cord tumours (haemangioblastomas), or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs), especially when surgery isn‚Äôt viable. üéâ
- Previously, options were limited to invasive surgeries or radiotherapy, often requiring recurrent operations throughout a patient‚Äôs life.
- With roughly 600 VHL patients in England, about 100 are expected to benefit from Welireg, with an additional 50 cases each year thereafter. This represents a significant improvement in management for these patients.
- After a previous hesitance from NICE regarding economic evidence, the route is now clearer for healthcare providers following an access agreement with NHS England. The decision is conditional, allowing for continued collection of efficacy data. üìà

Patients in England and Wales with a rare genetic disorder will soon be able to access treatment with MSD's Welireg via the NHS, nearly a year after their counterparts in Scotland.

In final draft guidance due to be finalised before the end of the month, Welireg (belzutifan) has been recommended as an option for treating adults with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a rare and life-shortening disease that can lead to the development of benign and cancerous tumours and cysts.

Specifically, Welireg becomes an option for VHL-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), brain and spinal cord tumours (haemangioblastomas), or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) when localised treatment like surgery isn't appropriate.

Until now, the only therapies available to patients with VHL have been invasive surgery or radiotherapy, with patients usually requiring multiple surgeries throughout their lives.

There are only about 600 adults in England living with the condition, and around 100 of them could be eligible for treatment with Welireg, with another 50 cases per year thereafter.

The decision comes after NICE withheld a recommendation for the drug last December, saying there were ""uncertainties"" in the clinical and economic evidence submitted for its appraisal. The SMC in Scotland backed NHS use of the drug in October 2023.

The new NICE recommendation is conditional, meaning that Welireg can be used while more evidence for its efficacy is collected, according to Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE. It comes after NHS England reached a commercial access deal with the manufacturer.

The appraisal committee heard from patient experts who explained that some people with VHL have a wide variety of debilitating symptoms depending on where the tumours are growing in the body. These include pain, loss of balance and motor skills, loss of vision, breathlessness, coughing, headaches, confusion, severe nausea, and fatigue.

Graham Lovitt, chair of patient advocacy group VHL UK/Ireland, said Welireg has ""game-changing potential"" and has shown extraordinary results for some patients in trials, including stabilisation of the tumours, reduction in growth, and ‚Äì in some cases ‚Äì the eradication of tumours altogether.

""We are delighted by NICE's recommendation of belzutifan [‚Ä¶] a significant milestone in the fight against this rare disease,"" he added. ""This decision brings hope to qualifying patients and their families, offering them an alternative treatment option, when others become too high risk.""

Welireg (belzutifan), an oral HIF-2 alpha inhibitor, has been approved by the UK drugs regulator the MHRA for VHL since May 2022. MSD acquired it as part of its $2.2 billion takeover of Peloton Therapeutics in 2019.

Despite the rarity of VHL tumours, MSD has blockbuster aspirations for Welireg, and now has a second regulatory approval for the drug in relapsed or refractory advanced RCC, with clinical trials on the go in glioblastoma multiforme, a hard-to-treat form of brain cancer.",gpt-4o-mini,xHsWqgfq1ua0uwlYo3u8

======================================================

The mRNA vaccine candidate more effectively limited symptoms and disease duration in non-human primates.

A study, funded by Moderna, the National institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) compared an investigational mRNA mpox vaccine from Moderna to a currently licensed Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine. The new mRNA vaccine candidate more effectively limits symptoms and disease duration in non-human primates infected with a lethal strain of mpox.

Alec Freyn, virology researcher at Moderna and co-first author, stated: ‚ÄúThis study is the first in a nonhuman primate model where we compare an investigational mRNA mpox vaccine directly to the current standard of care.‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúWhen we put those vaccines head-to-head in primates, we saw improved responses from the mRNA vaccine in terms of not just protection from survival but also fewer lesions, shorter duration of disease, and less viral shedding in the blood and respiratory tract.‚Äù

Originally designed to combat smallpox, MVA vaccines contained weakened whole viruses. Yet, this weakening means that they provide limited protection compared to other vaccines. The use of mRNA technology enables vaccines to be developed to only include parts of the virus that are most likely to induce a lasting, protective immune response without exposing the person to a whole infectious virus. The investigational mpox mRNA vaccine is composed of four viral antigens that are essential for the virus to attach and enter host cells.

Previous research has demonstrated that mRNA vaccines can prevent lethal mpox infections in nonhuman primates but their ability to lessen disease severity has not been tested. Therefore, to directly compare the investigational mRNA vaccine to MVA vaccines, the team vaccinated six macaques with each vaccine and then exposed them to a lethal strain of mpox virus eight weeks after their initial vaccine dose. Also, they exposed a control group of six unvaccinated animals to mpox. Then, after infection, the researchers monitored the macaque‚Äôs health for four weeks and collected blood samples to study their immune response.

Disease severity
----------------

Five of the unvaccinated control animals did not survive, whereas all 12 vaccinated animals did, regardless of which vaccine was used. The mRNA-vaccinated animals lost less weight and had fewer lesions than MVA-vaccinated animals, despite both vaccines limiting disease severity compared to the control group.

Furthermore, the mRNA vaccine shortened disease duration, measured by the number of days for which the animals showed lesions, by more than 10 days compared to the MVA vaccine. Lower viral loads were in the blood and throat swabs, indicating that it might be more effective at reducing transmission.

Jay Hooper, virologist at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and senior author explained: ‚ÄúWith the mRNA technology, we‚Äôre able to produce a vaccine that gives quite potent responses with a very tolerable safety profile‚Ä¶We‚Äôve been trying to get a vaccine that will prevent spread like ACAM2000¬Æ but without the safety issues. This is showing that mRNA technology might be able to fill that niche.‚Äù

Immune response
---------------

The mRNA vaccine resulted in a higher number of antibodies and antibodies with more diverse immune functions. Different classes of antibodies that were associated with enhanced viral control and fewer lesions were identified.

Furthermore, the vaccine demonstrated potential to induce cross-immunity to other Orthopoxviruses, whereas the MVA vaccine results in smaller immune responses that are not as strongly neutralising for more remotely related Orthopoxviruses. Serum from the macaques immunised with the mRNA vaccine ‚Äúneutralised not only mpox but also vaccinia, cowpox, rabbitpox, camelpox, and ectromelia virus,‚Äù Freyn said. ‚ÄúWe believe that this vaccine may protect from other Orthopoxvirus threats that may emerge in the future.‚Äù

Now, Moderna‚Äôs mRNA-1769 vaccine is being assessed in a Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT05995275) to determine the safety, tolerability and immune response of a range of doses of mRNA-1769.

GSK's severe asthma therapy Nucala could find a new lease of life as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) after showing a clear benefit in a phase 3 trial.

The headline result from the MATINEE trial of IL-5 inhibitor Nucala (mepolizumab) in adults with COPD was a statistically significant reduction in the annualised rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared to placebo that GSK said was ""clinically meaningful."" In the study, Nucala was added to inhaled maintenance therapy for COPD.

GSK has been studying Nucala in COPD for some time, and in 2017 reported mixed results for the drug in two earlier phase 3 trials called METREX and METREO.

METREX involved patients with a range of eosinophil levels and showed a statistically significant improvement for Nucala versus placebo on exacerbation rates. However, in METREO ‚Äì which focused on patients with higher levels only ‚Äì the difference between the two arms was not significant.

The company decided to file for approval regardless, but the FDA declined to approve the new indication in 2018, following the advice of an advisory committee, which found that GSK had not proved efficacy. It seems MATINEE will allow GSK to try its luck again.

The size of the improvement over placebo ‚Äì which reportedly extended for up to two years in the trial ‚Äì won't be available until the study is presented at a future medical congress, but is strong enough to warrant discussions with regulators about extending the indications for Nucala, according to the pharma group. It has previously suggested approval for COPD could come in the US in the first half of next year.

Nucala has been approved to treat severe eosinophilic asthma for almost a decade, and in the interim has had its label extended to include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome.

The drug remains one of GSK's top products, with sales of ¬£856 million ($1.1 billion) in the first half of this year, up 15%. COPD could open up a massive new market for the drug, which still has several years of patent life left before it could face biosimilar competition.

The lung disease affects more than 300 million people globally, with up to 40% of patients exhibiting type 2 inflammation characterised by a raised blood eosinophil count, which would make them suitable for treatment with Nucala.

Elevated eosinophil levels are associated with more severe COPD and a higher rate of exacerbations, the sudden flare-ups in symptoms that signal the progression of the disease and can lead to hospitalisation.

The MATINEE data comes at a time when options for COPD are on the up, after a decade with no new therapies.

In July, the European Commission became the first regulator worldwide to approve Sanofi and Regeneron's big-selling IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor Dupixent (dupilumab) as a treatment for the progressive lung disease, shortly after Verona Pharma got the go-ahead from the US FDA for its PDE 3/4 inhibitor Ohtuvayre (ensifentrine).

Dupixent ‚Äì which is due for a verdict from the FDA as a COPD therapy later this month ‚Äì was cleared for adults with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils, while Ohtuvayre can be used in all patients regardless of eosinophil levels.",gpt-4o-mini,0zIOYAyGUzOwaCYodEu0

Earlier this week, I visited one of Paris‚Äô few longevity clinics dedicated to preventative medicine ‚Äî and the only one that describes itself as a tech startup.

Hidden behind an unassuming Haussmannian door, just a few minutes away from the Paris Opera, the centre has been operating for nine months. The startup behind it, Zoƒ´, promises customers a ‚Äú360-degree check-up‚Äô ‚Äî a three-hour series of tests and exams, ranging from blood tests to eye scans through spirometry and gut microbiome analyses.

The objective? Collect millions of data points on up to 200 biomarkers that are in turn analysed by an AI model, in order to deliver lifestyle recommendations that, promises Zoƒ´, will prevent disease and improve customers‚Äô long-term wellness.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about adding years of life, but rather life to years,‚Äù says Zoƒ´ cofounder ‚Äî and former special advisor to French president Emmanuel Macron ‚Äî Isma√´l Em√©lien. ‚ÄúThe goal is to learn the body‚Äôs ‚Äòuser manual‚Äô to prevent illnesses and enable people to live in good health for longer.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not for everyone. Membership to Zoƒ´ is ‚Ç¨3.6k per year, which includes an annual checkup as well as the follow-up recommendations. That‚Äôs roughly the cost of a membership to Soho House, says Zoƒ´'s CFO Antoine Attali ‚Äî and the startup's customers usually belong to the same social circles.

The clinic caters to premium needs, from snacks elaborated by world-famous chef Alain Ducasse to a balneotherapy section modelled on ‚ÄòJapanese thermal baths‚Äò, featuring a snow cabin (?) and a mineral bath that is, I am told, ‚Äútwice as salty as the Dead Sea‚Äù.

Attali tells me that in the long-term, Zoƒ´ hopes to become accessible to everyone, and that prices will go down to a similar level to your average WiFi subscription.

For now, though, preventative health remains a hobby of the upper-class. In fact, Zoƒ´'s investors are all private individuals; the company‚Äôs ‚Ç¨20m seed round, which it raised in 2022, included a good number of high-profile billionaires such as Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saad√© and Moderna CEO St√©phane Bancel.

And Zoƒ´ is not the only longevity startup appealing to the ultra-rich. Spotify founder Daniel Ek is behind similar ventures, including [Sand Clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-ek-spotify-sand-clinic-longevity-news), where customers can receive full body check-ups and treatments ranging from vacuum therapy to red light saunas ‚Äî with membership expected to cost between ‚Ç¨1,000 and ‚Ç¨10,000 a month.

Ek is also the founder of healthtech Neko Health, which has built a full-body scanner for health data collection that it says helps doctors detect potential diseases earlier. The company [has a clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/ek-neko-body-scanner-test) and has just opened a new spot in London, right in the middle of Marylebone, where it prices a one-hour scan at ¬£299 ‚Äî almost double the price of a visit to the Stockholm clinic when it opened in 2023 (‚Ç¨180).

Despite the cost, the proposition seems appealing enough. Neko Health says it already has a waiting list of 22k people; Zoƒ´ says it has ‚Äúaround 1k members‚Äù to date and is currently carrying out a dozen check-ups per day ‚Äî but the startup is confident that it can ramp up to reach its maximum capacity of 35k annual check-ups in the next five years.

Whether or not the preventative treatments promised by startups like Zoƒ´, Neko Health and Sand Clinic will ever reach the masses remains to be seen; what seems certain for now is that billionaires won‚Äôt get tired of full-body-scanning anytime soon.

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","UK-based healthtech Doccla has secured a ¬£35m Series B, led by European VC Lakestar, with new investors French VC Elaia and existing investors General Catalyst, Speedinvest and the investment leg of German media company Bertelsmann also participating.

Having almost quadrupled its annual revenue in 2023, it's planning its expansion in DACH and France, and says its German and French investors will help its international growth plans.

The startup, founded in 2019, makes ‚Äúvirtual ward‚Äù technology for healthcare providers. It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.

Doccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland‚Äôs Health Service Executive (HSE).

Doccla‚Äôs founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.

‚ÄúWith the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it‚Äôs a huge opportunity to scale,‚Äù says Ratz.

The virtual A&E

Sweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.

According to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.

Patients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.

So far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it‚Äôs adding 1k new patients every month.

‚ÄúOver time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,‚Äù Ratz says.

Partnering with pharma

Doccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).

‚ÄúWe have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,‚Äù Ratz says. ‚ÄúThis is because we are in very close contact with our patients.‚Äù

Doccla says it‚Äôs interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he‚Äôs seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.

With 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.

In one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.

‚ÄúWe can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits ‚Äî in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,‚Äù Ratz says.

Doccla has raised a total of ¬£52m to date.

In October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.",gpt-4o-mini,w5bIVyGtofH28rqegF1I

- Caresyntax, a Berlin-based startup, has recently secured a substantial $180 million in Series C funding to further develop its AI-driven surgical data platform, bringing total equity funding to $220 million. This includes $80 million in equity and $100 million in debt, aimed at enhancing their technology that integrates with any operating room setup. 

- üöÄ With their goal to become the ""Android"" of surgical platforms, Caresyntax plans to leverage AI to analyze 1,000 data points per surgery. This capability not only supports surgeons in enhancing patient outcomes but also helps identify risks in real-time, such as unrecognized drops in heart rate during operations. 

- The platform streamlines workflows, informs post-operative care, and addresses the significant costs associated with surgeries, which account for 30% of healthcare expenditures in Europe alone. As healthcare systems face increasing pressures from aging populations and staffing shortages, innovations like this can allow for more effective resource management. 

- With the tech currently utilized in over 3,000 operating rooms and more than 3 million surgeries each year, Caresyntax‚Äôs expansion into the US and EMEA markets could redefine operational efficiency in surgery. 

As we see these advancements, what implications might this have for surgical practice and patient safety??

The round is made up of $80m in equity and $100m in debt ‚Äî and is tied to specific milestones. The fresh funding tops up the startup‚Äôs $130m Series C, raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.

It‚Äôs the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.

Caresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.

### AI for hospitals

Caresyntax says it wants to build the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals‚Äô surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.

The company‚Äôs platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.

While some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax‚Äôs platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.

‚ÄúEffectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,‚Äù they add.

If it does what it sets out to do, it‚Äôs a big opportunity.

Costs associated with operations account for 30% of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends 11% of GDP on health.

Founded in 2013 in Germany ‚Äî Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 ‚Äî its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company‚Äôs revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.

- GLP-1s, including popular drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy from Novo Nordisk, have seen skyrocketing valuations, with projections suggesting they could generate a staggering $150 billion in sales by the early 2030s.
- Startup founders are quickly recognizing the potential of these medications. For instance, Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform, has begun incorporating GLP-1s into their treatment regimens this year, noting double-digit growth in revenue and patient numbers.
- The excitement isn‚Äôt limited to established firms; new entrants are pivoting their business models to focus on GLP-1s, showcasing a remarkable shift in treatment paradigms for obesity.
- Despite the strong interest, challenges remain. With supply chain issues and reimbursement hurdles from national healthcare systems, particularly in Europe, startups may struggle to scale effectively.
- It's essential for these companies to secure reimbursement from public health systems to ensure broader access and sustainable growth. For example, while Wegovy is available through NHS clinics, it‚Äôs currently restrictive and not widely accessible.

As we assess the implications of this groundbreaking class of drugs on healthcare economics and treatment protocols, how do you think we can better facilitate access for patients seeking effective weight loss solutions?

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","The meteoric rise of a new class of weight loss drugs over the past two years, known as GLP-1s, has seen a new name take the title of Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, helped a country dodge a recession and hit grocery sales in the US.

The valuations of the companies that make this so-called ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù class of drugs ‚Äî which includes Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and US rival Eli Lilly (maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) ‚Äî have soared as investors bet big on a medication projected by some to hit $150bn in sales by the early 2030s.

The potential of the market has not been lost on founders.

It‚Äôs a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù opportunity, says Kai Eberhardt, the founder and CEO of Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform which operates in the UK, France and Germany, alongside its home market. It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.

‚ÄúFor us [GLP-1 drugs] are already a strong growth driver,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.‚Äù

While treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva‚Äôs overall business ‚Äî Eberhardt says it‚Äôs growing total patient and revenue numbers by ‚Äúdouble digit‚Äù percentage points year-on-year ‚Äî the meds could become the startup‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest‚Äù growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.

### Riding the wave

Oviva‚Äôs not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity ‚Äî many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.

In the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart‚Äôs CEO, food sales have fallen as the one in eight adults in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, propping up Denmark‚Äôs GDP in the process.

All of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have convinced them to get out their chequebook: Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a ‚Ç¨10m Series A in August 2023 a year on from a ‚Ç¨3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised ‚Ç¨3.1m last summer.

Many startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn‚Äôt start life offering them ‚Äî largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.

UK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs health‚Äù brand, but has recently changed that. The company‚Äôs website uses images of men and women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.

Yazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.

Meurling tells Sifted it had hit ‚Ç¨14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It‚Äôs now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.

Other startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men‚Äôs sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.

‚Äú[GLP-1 meds] are a game changer,‚Äù says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be ‚Äústrange‚Äù if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn‚Äôt looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.

While GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the ‚Äúhype‚Äù surrounding the drug class has ‚Äúopened doors‚Äù for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler ‚Äî adding that the startup managed to raise its ‚Ç¨400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It‚Äôs now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it‚Äôll look to target US employers ‚Äî who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.

### Kinks in the supply chain

There are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector ‚Äî not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.

Some of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate‚Äôs $100m in 2021 and Form Health‚Äôs $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than ‚Ç¨10m in a single round.

Investors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics ‚Äî Manual was still selling past the deadline.

If a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.

‚ÄúAs there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.‚Äù

### Who‚Äôll stump up the cash?

There‚Äôs also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.

While Numan‚Äôs head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the ‚Äúsuccess of private sector companies offering GLP-1 [drugs] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS‚Äù, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won‚Äôt be enough to hit real scale.

‚ÄúUS investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts [selling to whole organisations like health insurers],‚Äù says Syhler. ‚ÄúThis means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care ‚Äî where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.‚Äù

In Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.

In the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.

Oviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS ‚Äî but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it‚Äôs in ‚Äúmature dialogues with several health systems‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,‚Äù says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that don‚Äôt always want to work with startups. Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.

Whether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen ‚Äî but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. ‚ÄúI've never been an investor in a company that‚Äôs got so much attention ‚Äî in a space that‚Äôs got so much attention,‚Äù says Arnardottir.",gpt-4o-mini,OfJ8QLEaoTknkhadOIK3

TOPLINE:
--------

Mastitis in women over 50 years of age is a risk factor for development of breast cancer, according to a large retrospective cohort study of 2.4 million German women. Mastitis is an inflammation of breast tissue typically caused by a Staph infection.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   This study was a retrospective cohort of 2,381,594 women in 315 office-based gynaecology practices in Germany (2005-2021).
*   Women with mastitis (n = 14,892) were compared with women without mastitis (n = 14,892) and followed from 7 months to 10 years.
*   The control group without mastitis was propensity score-matched on age, index year, average yearly consultation frequency during the follow-up period, and coexisting conditions.
*   The primary outcome was an initial diagnosis of breast cancer.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Over the follow-up period, 2.9% of the mastitis cohort and 2.4% of the matched non-mastitis cohort developed breast cancer.
*   While Cox regression analysis uncovered a significant association between mastitis and breast cancer (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.11-1.70), the age-stratified analysis revealed a significant association only among women aged > 50 years. They had a 73% increase in the risk compared with women without mastitis (hazard ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.25-2.40).
*   Women aged ‚â§ 50 years had no significant increase in the risk for breast cancer.

IN PRACTICE:
------------

The authors concluded that ""The findings of our retrospective cohort study support an association between mastitis and subsequent breast cancer diagnoses in women aged > 50 years. The pathophysiological basis and possibility of confounders however requires further investigation.""

- A recent study involving 349 patients highlights the significance of circadian heart rate (HR) patterns. Researchers noted a strong correlation between impaired HR variability and both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, particularly in those with long-standing diabetes. 

- Key findings revealed that patients with low 24-hour heart rate standard deviation (SD) had nearly double the risk (hazard ratio: 1.99) of cardiovascular mortality and a 50% increase (hazard ratio: 1.50) in all-cause mortality compared to those with higher variability. 

- Further emphasizing this, the presence of a blunted nocturnal heart rate dip was linked to a 39% greater risk in both categories of mortality, suggesting that regular monitoring of heart rate is essential.  

With these findings, the potential for 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) as a practical risk stratification tool emerges for this vulnerable population.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

MADRID ‚Äî Impaired circadian heart rate (HR) fluctuations are linked to increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with long-standing diabetes.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Researchers analyzed data from 349 patients with type 2 (81%) or type 1 diabetes; about half were women, with a mean age of 57 years, body mass index (BMI) of 29.4, and A1c of 8.6%.
*   Participants underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (APBM) and HR monitoring, as well as assessment of diabetic microvascular complications.
*   The median SD value of ABPM-derived HR measurements was used to define patients with low daily HR fluctuations (low 24h-HR SD); a < 10% decline in average nighttime vs daytime HR identified patients (31%) with a blunted nocturnal HR dip.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   Low 24h-HR SD and blunted nocturnal HR dip were associated with an adverse cardiometabolic risk profile and a high prevalence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy and nephropathy.
*   After a mean 21 years of follow-up, 136 (39%) deaths occurred, of which 100 (68%) had a cardiovascular cause.
*   After adjustment for potential confounders ‚Äî including age, sex, BMI, glycemic control, diabetes type, and hypertension ‚Äî the low 24h-HR SD group had double the risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.99) for cardiovascular mortality and a 50% higher risk (HR, 1.50) for all-cause mortality than the high 24h-HR SD group.
*   Patients with a blunted nocturnal HR dip consistently had a 39% higher adjusted risk for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.61 for both) than those with a preserved nocturnal HR dip.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

Impaired circadian HR fluctuations are associated with microvascular disease and increased long-term cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes, the authors wrote. ""Identifying these conditions via 24h-ABPM may provide a cost-effective risk stratification tool in this high-risk population.""

Key Points

**Question** What is the cost-effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)‚Äìguided risk-stratified mammography screening intervals in the United Kingdom National Breast Cancer Screening Program?

**Findings** This decision analytical model evaluated 4 AI-based risk-stratified screening interval regimens in comparison with the current United Kingdom screening program. The net monetary benefit of introducing the optimal regimen ranged from approximately ¬£60.4 million (US $77.3 million) to ¬£85.3 million (US $109.2 million).

**Meaning** These results suggest that AI-based risk stratified breast cancer screening programs may be more cost-effective screening programs, providing additional health benefits with fewer resources than universal screening intervals for all.

**Importance** Previous research has shown good discrimination of short-term risk using an artificial intelligence (AI) risk prediction model (Mirai). However, no studies have been undertaken to evaluate whether this might translate into economic gains.

**Objective** To assess the cost-effectiveness of incorporating risk-stratified screening using a breast cancer AI model into the United Kingdom (UK) National Breast Cancer Screening Program.

**Design, Setting, and Participants** This study, conducted from January 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024, involved the development of a decision analytical model to estimate health-related quality of life, cancer survival rates, and costs over the lifetime of the female population eligible for screening. The analysis took a UK payer perspective, and the simulated cohort consisted of women aged 50 to 70 years at screening.

**Exposures** Mammography screening at 1 to 6 yearly screening intervals based on breast cancer risk and standard care (screening every 3 years).

**Main Outcomes and Measures** Incremental net monetary benefit based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and National Health Service (NHS) costs (given in pounds sterling; to convert to US dollars, multiply by 1.28).

**Results** Artificial intelligence‚Äìbased risk-stratified programs were estimated to be cost-saving and increase QALYs compared with the current screening program. A screening schedule of every 6 years for lowest-risk individuals, biannually and triennially for those below and above average risk, respectively, and annually for those at highest risk was estimated to give yearly net monetary benefits within the NHS of approximately ¬£60.4 (US $77.3) million and ¬£85.3 (US $109.2) million, with QALY values set at ¬£20‚ÄØ000 (US $25‚ÄØ600) and ¬£30‚ÄØ000 (US $38‚ÄØ400), respectively. Even in scenarios where decision-makers hesitate to allocate additional NHS resources toward screening, implementing the proposed strategies at a QALY value of ¬£1 (US $1.28) was estimated to generate a yearly monetary benefit of approximately ¬£10.6 (US $13.6) million.

**Conclusions and Relevance** In this decision analytical model study of integrating risk-stratified screening with a breast cancer AI model into the UK National Breast Cancer Screening Program, risk-stratified screening was likely to be cost-effective, yielding added health benefits at reduced costs. These results are particularly relevant for health care settings where resources are under pressure. New studies to prospectively evaluate AI-guided screening appear warranted.

Early detection of breast cancer is a top priority for the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS). The NHS largely uses an age-based screening strategy, inviting women aged 50 to 70 years for mammography screening triennially; most other countries with a breast screening program adopt a biennial program. This one-size-fits-all approach might be improved by tailoring screening so that those at highest risk receive the greatest intensity of screening (risk-based screening).

The NHS is considering the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into mammogram interpretation for breast screening in the future. AI is currently not used in NHS breast screening appointments in the UK due to a lack of high-quality prospective studies, but emerging prospective data are promising.

In parallel with AI for cancer detection, AI for risk prediction has been proposed. One such model (Mirai) interprets data automatically generated from mammogram screenings, without the need for data collection through questionnaires. The AI model offers an immediate estimation of an individual‚Äôs short-term risk of cancer incidence following a mammogram with negative findings. The AI model is open source and freely available for research and is arguably the best (retrospectively) validated AI model for short-term breast cancer risk assessment. One analysis included an external validation across 7 hospitals spanning 3 continents, and overall, evidence suggests that in the short term, it attains a higher area under the receiving operating characteristics curve than classical risk models or breast density.

While the performance of the AI model for risk assessment is highly promising, one area that has not been rigorously evaluated is whether using the model to guide screening could offer value for money. Our aim was therefore to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of integrating risk-stratified screening using the model into the UK National Breast Cancer Screening Program, through a health economic model. We considered risk-based screening strategies that would be expected to require the same number of screens as the current triennial program, assuming perfect adherence. In practice, strategies that involve extended screening intervals for a larger proportion of the population than those who receive more frequent screening might require fewer screens overall.

Specific risk-stratified breast cancer screening regimens (RSBCRs), determined by risk thresholds, were based on recent work that used a simplified deterministic model to evaluate potential effectiveness. These RSBCRs involve screening intervals aligned with corresponding risk thresholds tailored for the AI model chosen for this research. In this report, we developed an economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 4 AI-based screening strategies in comparison with the current screening program. The economic model was then used to estimate health-related quality of life, survival, and NHS costs over the lifetime of the female population eligible for screening in the UK. Results from our analysis might inform future prospective evaluations of AI-guided screening.

This study was conducted from January 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024. We followed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) reporting guideline and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence methods of technology appraisal manual. We developed a discrete event simulation model in R, version 4.2.2, using the simmer‚Äô package (R Project for Statistical Computing) to accommodate individual attributes that evolve over time within the simulation such as breast cancer risk. The work was funded by Cancer Research UK and the policy research unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions. Because the data are drawn from publicly available sources, ethics approval is not required for decision modeling in the UK.

The following 4 strategies were distinguished by screening intervals in years for groups categorized by a 3-year risk score (RS):

1. One year (RS, ‚â•2.57%), 2 years (RS, 1.32%-2.57%), 3 years (RS, 1.22%-1.32%), or 6 years (RS, ‚â§1.22%)
2. One year (RS, ‚â•2.72%), 3 years (RS, 1.23%-2.72%), or 6 years (RS, ‚â§1.23%)
3. Two years (RS, ‚â•2.79%), 3 years (RS, 1.35%-2.79%), or 6 years (RS, ‚â§1.35%)
4. One year (RS, ‚â•2.20%), 3 years (RS, 1.23%-2.20%), or 4 years (RS, ‚â§1.23%).

The model focused on 5 dynamic processes: (1) Women transition between risk groups based on screen attendance and AI-model‚Äìassessed risk scores. (2) Mammogram accuracy is based on breast density, which changes as women age. (3) Attendance patterns to screening appointments are influenced by age and attendance history. (4) Attendance history and time intervals between screenings impact cancer stage. (5) Cancer prognosis is influenced by age, where it was identified (at regular screening or not), and attendance history, with worse outcomes for women who have not attended breast screenings.

Structure and Model Events

[Figure 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#zoi240951f1) depicts the model structure, illustrating the sequence of clinical events and potential pathways from initiation to screening, cancer detection, and mortality. Women enter the model at the first screening invitation at 50 years of age, with subsequent invitations occurring at regular intervals until 70 years of age. Each screening appointment includes an updated AI risk assessment, determining the timing of the next screen invitation. If a woman misses her initial screening, invitations are sent every 3 years thereafter. The model ends when individuals reach cancer-related mortality or mortality from all other causes.

At entry, women are assigned predetermined ages of noncancer mortality and have a chance of developing breast cancer up to 74 years of age, sourced from Office for National Statistics life expectancy tables (2018-2020) and NHS breast cancer registry data. The age at which symptomatic cancer is detected in a primary care setting is sampled from 2020 incidence data, adjusted for age-related lead time in the UK screening program using overdiagnosis estimates. Screening may identify cancer at an earlier age than this determined age of symptomatic cancer. Data on attendance from 2018 to 2019, stratified by age and screening history, were used to calculate attendance probability to a screening invitation. The NHS incurs a cost of ¬£14.52 (US $18.59) for each screening invitation (details of screening costs are in eTable 2 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1)). Screening invitations end at 70 years of age or the nearest subsequent year if screening is not scheduled at 70 years of age. For instance, in simulating the current program with screenings every 3 years, a woman attending screening at 68 years of age would receive her last invitation at 71 years of age, after which any developing cancers would be detected symptomatically.

Model Event: Screening Appointment

Attending women undergo a mammogram; if cancer is detected, further assessments are conducted. Breast density and AI model scores are from UK women aged 46 to 74 years and applied based on age and cancer presence. Details are available in eMethods 1 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1).

In the model, a woman‚Äôs age for potential tumor detection is set before her first screening and remains constant throughout her life. Screening detection ages are calculated by subtracting the tumor presence period from the age at which symptomatic cancer is detected. The tumor presence period is derived from national breast screening program data and is based on age, with mean durations ranging from approximately 6 years at 35 years of age to 8 years at 85 years of age.

Each mammography session has a cost of ¬£54.32 (US $69.53) and results in a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss of 0.0014 due to associated discomfort. A summary table of the diagnostic accuracy of mammography is presented in eTable 1 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1). Sensitivity estimates are sourced from recent estimates in a population-based screening program and vary based on breast density, ranging from 62% (dense) to 90% (not dense). False-positive results occur when no underlying tumor is present during a screening, with chances ranging from 1.5% (not dense) to 2.9% (dense), and they cause a QALY loss of 0.0771. Mammographic results indicating cancer leads to further assessments, which verify whether the cancer is present, and involve mammography, ultrasonography, and biopsy totaling ¬£484.90 (US $620.67). Detailed breakdowns of mammography‚Äôs diagnostic accuracy, screening and further assessment costs, and screen-related QALY losses are found in eTables 2 and 3 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1).

Model Event: Interval Between Screening Appointments

Between screening appointments, cancers are detected immediately in primary care on reaching the age of symptomatic detection, with the primary care appointment costing ¬£37.00 (US $47.36), and further assessment totaling ¬£484.90 (US $620.67) NHS cost. Mortality due to other causes than breast cancer can occur and aging results in a health utility loss based on a published formula.

Model Event: Cancer Treatment and Survival

After cancer detection, cancer is classified as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive tumor TNM stages I to IV, determined by age and mode of detection (at a screening appointment or symptomatically in primary care) using UK population screening data. The stage distribution is adjusted based on the time since the last screen, using US data comparing stage distribution by screening frequency. Detailed methodology and sources can be found in Hill et al.

Treatment-related health losses and NHS costs vary by age, stage, mode of detection (screen or symptomatic), and time since detection (for follow-up costs and health recovery). Health utility losses after cancer are taken from multivariate regression, using the utility decrements on age, stage, and mode of detection. Recovery times are 11 years for screen-detected and interval cancers and 12 years for symptomatic cancers, based on peak health-related quality of life values post cancer detection. Stage 4 cancers are assumed to show no improvement in quality of life.

Cancer survival estimates come from Office for National Statistics mortality statistics and multivariable regressions. Mortality hazard ratios by stage and detection mode are applied to age-based mortality to determine life expectancy. Cancer treatment-related utility losses, costs, and survival estimates are available in eTables 4 to 6 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1).

Economic and Clinical Outcomes

Costs were assessed from a UK payer perspective and reported in 2022 pounds sterling. Quality-adjusted life-years and costs were discounted at 3.5%. The main economic outcome is incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) per woman, which quantifies in monetary terms the net benefit of interventions by reflecting the potential alternative use of intervention resources for other health care treatments. Incremental net monetary benefit is established from differences in patient costs, and from assigning a monetary value to the difference in QALYs, which we assume to be ¬£20 000 (US $25 600), ¬£30 000 (US $38 400), and ¬£1 (US $1.28) per QALY. The latter represents a scenario where a decision-maker is reluctant to spend additional NHS resources to increase population health. Population-wide INMB is derived by multiplying the per-woman INMB by the population size of women at 50 years of age eligible for screening invitations, which is 174‚ÄØ523, sourced from the 2022 national breast screening program data. Clinical outcomes include tumor stage at detection, cancers detected during screening, breast cancer deaths prevented by RSBCRs in the population (174‚ÄØ523 women), and the number of screens conducted.

All analyses were performed using R, version 4.2.2 (R Program for Statistical Computing). We conducted external validation of the model against targets derived from the 2022 national breast screening program data. To identify where savings occur, cost results are divided into screening-related costs and those for treating DCIS and invasive cancers. Cancer treatment costs are broken down by stage (DCIS, stages I-II, and stages III-IV) and mode of detection (screen-detected and interval cancers). Deterministic sensitivity analysis is conducted by adjusting the cancer treatment and screening costs, health-related quality of life losses from cancer and screening, and mammography sensitivity. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is performed using 250 Monte Carlo simulations using probabilistic sensitivity analysis parameter distributions reported in eTable 8 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1). The probability that each RSBCR is cost-effective is illustrated on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Population-wide INMB estimates from the 250 Monte Carlo simulations are calculated across cost per QALY values ranging from ¬£1 (US $1.28) to ¬£100 000 (US $128 000).

[Table 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#zoi240951t1) shows base-case economic results and the annual impact of the economic results in the entire population. All the AI-based regimens were associated with reduced NHS costs and increased QALYs compared with the current screening program. The strategy of conducting screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk had the highest additional net monetary gain per woman invited for screening. This amounts to ¬£346 (US $442.88) and ¬£489 (US $625.92) under the assumption of QALY values being ¬£20‚ÄØ000 (US $25 600) and ¬£30 000 (US $38 400), respectively. Consequently, this leads to an annual net monetary benefit within the NHS screening program totaling ¬£10.6 million (US $13.6 million) for QALY values of ¬£1, ¬£60.4 million (US $77.3 million) for QALY values of ¬£20 000, and ¬£85.3 million (US $109.2 million) for QALY values of ¬£30 000. The 3 alternative approaches had comparable figures for the net monetary benefit gained. For instance, the screening strategy of 6 yearly, triannual, and biannual screening has the smallest incremental net monetary benefit, amounting to ¬£188 (US $240.64) and ¬£236 (US $302.08) per person, assuming QALY values of ¬£20 000 and ¬£30 000, respectively. This resulted in an annual population incremental net benefit of ¬£32.7 million (US $41.9 million), assuming ¬£20 000 per QALY and ¬£41.2 million (US $52.7 million), assuming ¬£30 000 per QALY.

[Table 2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#zoi240951t2) shows the clinical and screening program results. The clinical outcomes of all regimens showed an improvement compared with the current screening program. Compared with the current screening program, conducting screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk resulted in a higher number of screen-detected cancers (10‚ÄØ549 vs 8943), a greater percentage of DCIS cancers at detection (17.1% vs 13.6%), a reduction in the number of screens (mean [SD], 3.22 [0.02] vs 4.68 [0.05]), and prevention of 834 deaths due to breast cancer.

Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis Results

The deterministic sensitivity analysis results align with the cost-effectiveness of screening regimens found in the base-case model. Screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk was likely to be most beneficial. Risk-stratified breast cancer screening regimens maintained their cost-effectiveness compared with the current program and each other. The breakdown of NHS costs incurred by women shows screening costs are lower in the RSBCR than in the current program. Cancer treatment costs incurred are larger for RSBCRs due to life extension for patients with cancer from increased screen detection of cancers and early cancer detection.

Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis Results

The probabilistic sensitivity analysis results demonstrate an improvement in the cost-effectiveness of screening regimens compared with the base-case model, without a shift in the ranking of programs from most to least cost-effective. The regimen with screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, or 6 years had the highest probability of being cost-effective (59% at ¬£20‚ÄØ000 [US $25 600] per QALY) and had the largest net monetary benefit for all cost per QALY thresholds. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve shows the regimen of 2, 3, or 6 years was likely to be the least cost-effective alternative option for RSBCRs, and the current screening program has a negligible probability of being cost-effective across all cost per QALY thresholds.

Under our analytic model, AI-based risk-stratified screening is likely to be cost-effective compared with the current one-size-fits-all screening program. Our findings are consistent with previous modeling studies demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of risk-stratified screening, whether based on traditional risk factors like family history or newer methods such as polygenic risk scores. However, our model is the first to suggest that health care resources might be reduced with RSBCRs, while attaining at least the same effectiveness for the population. This study is also the first to assess the cost-effectiveness of AI interpretation of breast images for risk assessment during routine screening. This might be more feasible at scale than the other risk assessment methods.

While the estimated incremental economic benefits per individual invited to breast screening may seem modest in the base-case model, ranging from ¬£188 (US $240.64) to ¬£346 (US $442.88), the annual monetary gains for the NHS might be substantial, estimated to range from ¬£32.7 million (US $ 41.9 million) to ¬£60.4 million (US $77.3 million). In the probabilistic model, these savings are around 3 times larger. The health economic model suggests that RSBCRs can reduce screening utilization, NHS costs, and invasive cancer in the population and increase QALYs. The reduction in the number of screenings with an RSBCR could free up resources to address screening backlogs and reduce wait times where those problems exist in the UK, potentially further improving breast cancer outcomes.

Annual screening RSBCRs lead to higher percentages of screen-detected cancers and greater percentages of DCIS cancers at detection, along with higher QALYs. However, biennial screening for the highest-risk group, with corresponding 3 and 6 yearly screening for other risk groups, incurs lower costs due to fewer screenings. Screen utilization is not the only explanation of the difference in cost-effectiveness among the regimens. Other contributing factors are the proportion of individuals at medium and high risk within the population undergoing intensified screening surveillance, their uptake to screening appointments, and the accuracy of mammography in women with denser breast tissue that makes cancers harder to detect. Although cost-effectiveness is important, it is not the only factor to consider when comparing the benefits of the regimen. For example, a population accustomed to the UK‚Äôs triennial screening program may view a 6-year gap between screenings as unacceptable, favoring a 4-year interval instead. This change to an RSBCR screening program with a 4-year screening interval for patients at low risk would generate an annual monetary benefit of ¬£50 million (US $64 million), assuming a QALY is valued at ¬£20 000 (US $25 600). Significant variations in screening frequency within programs can be accepted by patients. In the UK, colonoscopy surveillance guidelines for cancer vary by risk level, with no surveillance for patients at low risk, every 3 years for patients at intermediate risk, and annually for patients at high risk.

This study has some limitations. First, the model is parametrized for the UK. Findings may not be directly generalizable to alternative geographical populations, such as the US or elsewhere in Europe. Clinical guidelines in these regions often recommend universal annual or biennial screening, while a triennial screening program is in place in the UK, and typically screening also begins at earlier ages in these regions. Therefore, the comparator screen detection rates based on triennial screening, on which the model depends, are likely to differ across populations with varied screening frequencies and onset ages. For example, in a setting where annual screening is the norm, all the regimens considered would reduce costs but also effectiveness. Further analysis using the model could usefully contribute to decisions on the economic value of decreasing intensity of screening based on breast cancer AI in such settings.

In this decision analytical model study of risk-based screening with AI-based risk assessment, risk-based screening delivered health benefits while using fewer NHS resources compared with the current UK breast screening program. New studies to prospectively evaluate AI-guided screening appear warranted.

A recent study sheds light on a concerning disparity in the UK healthcare system:
- A retrospective analysis of nearly 300,000 heart disease patients reveals that women, Black individuals, and residents of deprived areas are significantly less likely to receive cardiac surgeries like CABG and valve procedures.
- üö® Key findings indicate that these demographics have:
  - 59% (women), 32% (Black patients), and 35% (deprived communities) lower access to CABG.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

MADRID ‚Äî In a rat study, two versions of an experimental monthly injectable semaglutide-loaded hydrogel show extended release over 1 month and good tolerance. If found to be safe and effective in people, a once-monthly formulation could improve patient adherence and quality of life of those with type 2 diabetes or obesity.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   About half or more patients taking semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist approved for treating obesity with or without type 2 diabetes, may discontinue treatment with their once-weekly subcutaneous injections or daily oral pills at 12 months, but longer-acting formulations may increase drug efficacy and patient adherence.
*   Researchers have developed two versions of an injectable semaglutide-loaded hydrogel mixed with a pair of degradable polymers that chemically bond together.
*   After injection, the formulations form either a gel disk or microgel suspension that enables a gradual and prolonged drug release.
*   To identify the optimal formulation, researchers analyzed the hydrogel compositions in vitro to study drug release kinetics, duration of effectiveness, and semaglutide loading content.
*   The experimental semaglutide-loaded hydrogel disk or microgel particles were injected subcutaneously in six wild-type Wistar Han male rats of normal weight (250-300 g) to characterize semaglutide pharmacokinetics and hydrogel biocompatibility.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   The formulation could be easily injected using a 25G needle, with gelation starting within minutes of mixing.
*   In both versions, a single injection of the hydrogel-based formulations in rats demonstrated a minimal initial early release, followed by a consistent release over the course of 1 month.
*   The product was well tolerated with no edema or inflammatory reaction during the treatment period.
*   The hydrogel could be easily degraded by enzymes in in vitro studies.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""A small dollop of gel, known as a 'depot,' of the semaglutide-laden hydrogel is injected under the skin,"" said Claire M√©gret, PhD, lead author of the poster presentation, in a news release. ""Our pre-clinical results demonstrate that the regular, slow release of semaglutide over one month after administering a single dose, with limited early release, is achievable,"" she added.

Primary Care Women's Health Forum

**In Anticipation of** _**Guidelines Live**_ **2024, the PCWHF Provides a Taster of its Sessions in the Women‚Äôs Health Stream, Which Will Address Key Issues Around Menopause and HRT**

A PCWHF session at _Guidelines Live_ 2023

The Primary Care Women‚Äôs Health Forum (PCWHF) is excited to return to _Guidelines Live_ in 2024, following its success delivering presentations to full lecture theatres in 2023. This year, PCWHF speaker sessions will have a primary-care relevant, practical focus, underpinned by realistic case studies to illustrate the application of guidelines in the real world.

Published in 2022, the _Women‚Äôs Health Strategy for England_ notes that there is not enough focus on women-specific issues such as menopause. Over the past few years, healthcare professionals have faced challenges such as shortages of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT), a lack of licensed options for testosterone as part of HRT, and funding for the fitting of intrauterine devices and implants that may not cover the costs of the procedure.

In the first of the PCWHF speaker sessions on Day 1, **Dr Julie Oliver**, PCWHF Chair, will discuss the recent British Menopause Society guideline on the management of unscheduled bleeding in women taking HRT. The guideline provides a new approach to risk stratification, and includes a helpful one-page summary flowchart to guide management. It also answers the perennial question ‚Äò_How high is too high?_‚Äô‚Äîthat is, what is the oestrogen dose needed to increase the amount of progestogen in an HRT regime? Dr Oliver is an NHS GP in County Durham, with an extended role in women‚Äôs health and a long history of speaking at conferences such as _Guidelines Live_.

On the Day 2 of _Guidelines Live_ 2024, **Dr Caroline Cooper** will give a contraception update, with a focus on new guidance. Dr Cooper will explore contraceptive options for women over 40 years of age, emphasising safety, efficacy, and individualised care approaches. Dr Cooper is an experienced GP with an extended role in women‚Äôs health. She is also a faculty-registered trainer, and has served on the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare committees, as well as being a current director of the PCWHF.

Next, **Dr Angela Wright** will continue the HRT theme, but adding relevance to younger women, by discussing testosterone and libido. Informed by her experience of primary and secondary care NHS work, Dr Wright‚Äôs speaker session will explain how those in primary care can support women who have complex menopause issues, sexual dysfunction, and premenstrual disorders. Dr Wright is a fellow of the European Committee of Sexual Medicine, and an active committee member of the British Society of Sexual Medicine.

### The Primary Care Women‚Äôs Health Forum

These _Guidelines Live_ sessions are supported by the Primary Care Women‚Äôs Health Forum (PCWHF), a group of 10,000 healthcare professionals with a special interest in women‚Äôs health. The PCWHF aims to promote and progress standards in women‚Äôs health in primary care through education, resources, and events, and lobbies on behalf of its members to determine future strategic direction and policymaking for women‚Äôs health.

- A recent study involving over 207,000 middle-aged adults from the UK Biobank found compelling evidence linking ultra-processed food consumption to increased RA risk. 
- Participants consuming the highest amounts of ultra-processed foods faced a 17% GREATER risk of developing RA compared to those in the lowest consumption group. üìä  
- Notably, this risk heightened with each incremental increase in ultra-processed food intake, suggesting a direct correlation worth considering in dietary advice. 
- Inflammatory markers, lipids, and liver enzymes accounted for up to 14.8% of this association, emphasizing the biological pathway connecting diet with autoimmune conditions. 

As we continue to explore dietary influences in clinical practice, it‚Äôs critical to advocate for reduced ultra-processed food consumption. With nearly HALF of food intake in the UK classified as ultra-processed, integrating these findings into guidelines could be pivotal in RA prevention strategies. 

What changes can we implement in dietary counseling to prioritize whole foods over ultra-processed options for our patients?  ü§î

Clinical Summary

Rheumatoid Arthritis: Whole-Food Diet May Be Protective
=======================================================

Susan London

TOPLINE:
--------

Middle-aged adults who consume more ultra-processed foods have an elevated risk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that is mediated in part through circulating biomarkers.

METHODOLOGY:¬†
-------------

*   Investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study of 207,012 middle-aged adults without RA from the UK Biobank who completed 24-hour dietary recalls.
*   Foods and beverages were classified as (1) unprocessed or minimally processed foods, (2) processed culinary ingredients, (3) processed foods, or (4) ultra-processed foods (eg, soft drinks, sweet or savoury packaged snacks, reconstituted meat products, pre-prepared frozen dishes).
*   The main outcome was the incident RA based on hospital diagnoses.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Overall, 0.9% of participants received an RA diagnosis during a median follow-up of about 12 years.
*   Relative to peers in the lowest quintile of ultra-processed food consumption, participants in the highest quintile had a 17% greater adjusted risk for RA.
*   The risk rose across quintile (P < .05) and increased by 6% with each standard deviation increase in ultra-processed food intake.
*   Mediation analyses suggested that inflammatory, lipid, and liver enzyme biomarkers explained 3.1%-14.8% of the association between ultra-processed food intake and RA risk.
*   Findings were similar regardless of participants' age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, household income, and healthy diet score.

IN PRACTICE:¬†
-------------

""Lower [ultra-processed food] consumption is recommended to reduce RA incidence,"" the authors wrote, noting that up to half of the food consumed in the United Kingdom now falls into the ultra-processed category. ""Dietary guidelines should prominently feature the detrimental effects of [ultra-processed foods], and recommendations to curtail their consumption should be integrated into public health initiatives, to mitigate the risk of RA,"" they added.

- A retrospective analysis involving 90 patients revealed that both magnesium valproate and lamotrigine significantly improved neuropsychiatric outcomes compared to olanzapine. After three weeks, both adjunctive treatments led to lower PANSS total scores (P < 0.05).  

- üìä The improvements extended to cognitive function as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), showing higher scores for patients treated with magnesium valproate and lamotrigine when compared to those on olanzapine.

- After three months, the proportion of patients achieving a modified Rankin scale score of 0-1, indicative of good functional outcomes, was significantly higher in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups (P < 0.05).

- EEG abnormalities also improved, highlighting greater normalization in those receiving magnesium valproate and lamotrigine after three months (P < 0.05).

- Notably, both magnesium valproate and lamotrigine treatments contributed to a significant decrease in the Glx/Cr ratio, suggesting a rebalance in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission which may underlie the clinical benefits observed.

Abstract
--------

### Background

This study aimed to compare the impact of olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine as adjunctive treatments for anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. And it is expected to add supporting points related to the rebalance of neurotransmitters in the brain through adjuvant therapy in the clinical management of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

### Methods

This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis who received standardized immunotherapy at Hunan Brain Hospital between January 2018 and December 2020.

### Results

Compared to the olanzapine group, both the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups showed lower scores on the positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS) total score after 3 weeks of treatment (all _P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) scores in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were significantly higher than in the olanzapine group after 3 weeks and 3 months of treatment (all _P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). After 3 months of treatment, the proportions of patients with a modified Rankin scale score (mRS) of 0‚Äì1 in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were significantly higher than in the olanzapine group (all _P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). The electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormality ranks at 3 months were significantly lower in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups compared with the olanzapine group (all _P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Furthermore, the Glx/Cr ratio significantly decreased after 3 months of treatment (all _P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups, while the Glx/Cr ratio in the olanzapine group showed no significant change (_P_‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05).

### Conclusion

Compared with olanzapine, the addition of magnesium valproate or lamotrigine to immunotherapy might be associated with a lower PANSS score, higher MoCA score, and lower mRS score. The improvement of neurological functions and cognitive function may be related to the decreased Glx/Cr ratio.

Introduction
------------

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a rare autoimmune encephalitis with acute onset neuropsychiatric symptoms due to an autoimmune reaction to the glutamate N receptor (GluN1) subunit of the neuronal NMDAR. The reported annual incidence is about 1.5 per million persons-year. Currently, the recommended treatment for anti-NMDAR encephalitis is the use of first-line immunotherapy that includes glucocorticoids, Œ≥-globulin, plasma exchange, tumor resection, acyclovir (until a viral etiology is ruled out), and symptomatic support. Still, only about 53% of patients appear to respond well to first-line immunotherapy, with a fairly high recurrence rate. Pathogenically, the autoantibody binds to the extracellular domain of the GluN1 subunit, resulting in NMDAR internalization and glutamatergic hypofunction. The first-line immunotherapies appear to intervene at the antigen/antibody reaction stage, which might underscore the limited effectiveness of this treatment strategy in the context of potentially broader pathophysiological alterations in the brain.

Given the existence of glutamatergic hypofunction in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, it can be hypothesized that an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission should be present in the brain, contributing to the pathophysiology of the disease. Accordingly, adjuvant therapies that help mitigate this imbalance could be beneficial in the clinical management of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. A case report suggested using adjuvant memantine to manage catatonia in anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Ketamine can also be used in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and refractory persistent epilepsy. Intrathecal methotrexate has been suggested for refractory anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Still, few data are available regarding adjuvant therapies in anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

Therefore, this retrospective study aimed to compare the cognitive and neurological functions of three adjuvant drugs in treating anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and to establish a relationship between these improvements and the balance in neuronal excitation and inhibition through glutamate (Glu) and Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Based on this study, we hypothesized that the effects of three adjunctive therapeutics in the treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis were determined by relating their clinical efficacy for the improvement of cognitive and neurological functions to their extent of pharmacological modulation of glutamate (Glu) and Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission in the cerebrum.

Materials and methods
---------------------

### Study design and patients

This retrospective study collected the clinical data of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis admitted to Hunan Brain Hospital between January 2018 and December 2020. All included patients received standard immunotherapy and different adjuvant treatments. The patients were then grouped based on the adjuvant medications they received.

The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Hunan Brain Hospital (approval #2018K065). The requirement for informed consent was waived by the committee because of the retrospective nature of the study. All data were anonymized after extraction and before analysis.

### Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Clinical cases meeting the diagnostic criteria for anti-NMDAR encephalitis according to clinical guidelines. The exclusion criteria included encephalitis with other causes, tumors found, seizures as the first symptom, and incomplete clinical data.

### Drug administration

All patients receive standardized first-line immunotherapy after admission, including intravenous immunoglobulin injection (According to the patient‚Äôs weight, a total of 2 g/kg should be administered intravenously for three to five days.), plasma exchange (with a dose of 1.0 to 1.5 times the total plasma volume, performed 3‚Äì6 exchanges within 10‚Äì14 days.), glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 1000 mg/d for 3 consecutive days, 500 mg/d for 3 consecutive days, followed by a reduction of 40-80 mg/d.). According to the 2017 Consensus of Chinese Experts on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Autoimmune Encephalitis, doctors choose different drugs for adjuvant treatment based on the different clinical symptoms of patients.

### Outcomes and data collection

The primary outcome was improving the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). As per routine practice, all patients underwent assessments using the PANSS, the MoCA, and the mRS before initiating any treatment. The PANSS and the MoCA were conducted at 3 weeks and 3 months after the initial treatments. The mRS were assessed at 3 months after the start of treatments. The PANSS quantifies positive symptoms (which refer to excess or distortion of normal functions, e.g., hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (which represent a diminution or loss of normal functions) and is widely used in the study of psychopharmacologic therapy. Each subscale is scored 1‚Äì7 points ranging from absent to extreme. The range for the positive and negative scales is 7‚Äì49, and the range for the general psychopathology scale is 16‚Äì112. The MoCA is a test used to detect mild cognitive decline and early signs of dementia. It contains 11 tests in eight cognitive areas: attention and concentration, executive function, memory, language, visual structure skills, abstract thinking, computation, and orientation. The total score is 30, and _‚â•_‚Äâ26 is considered normal. The mRS is originally developed to evaluate the state of neurological recovery in patients after stroke, and it has been extended used to various neurological conditions, including autoimmune encephalitis. The mRS scores are categorized as follows: 0: no symptoms; 1: no significant disability and able to carry out all usual activities; 2: slight disability; 3: moderate disability; 4: moderately severe disability; 5: severe disability; 6: death. Generally, mRS scores of 0‚Äì1 indicate a good functional prognosis. The above experimental scales were evaluated by two residents of the psychiatric department of this hospital.

The secondary outcomes were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and antibody titer changes. The above experimental scales were evaluated by two Imaging doctors and electroencephalography doctors.

All patients underwent EEG assessments before initiating any treatment, as well as at 3 weeks and 3 months after the start of the treatments. The EEGs were rated as normal, mild, moderate, or severe. The EEG records from the patients were scored as the frequency (n) of ‚Äúnormal and mild background abnormalities (No‚Äâ+‚ÄâMi)‚Äù or ‚Äúmoderate background and severe background abnormalities (Mo‚Äâ+‚ÄâSe)‚Äù. The improvement rate of EEG was defined as (No‚Äâ+‚ÄâMi)/total number of patients √ó100%. The patients underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) before treatment and 3 months after treatment. The powers of the neurotransmitters Glu and GABA were determined by brain fluctuation mapping, with the Glx/Cr index measured at the top of the left frontal lobe in each patient. The reference powers of Glu and GABA in the brain were determined by Shenzhen Kangli High Tech Co., Ltd. after testing 10,000 healthy people nationwide and were 38.36‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ12.91 for Glu and 31.67‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ13.93 for GABA. In order to further explore the influence of drug treatment on the excitatory/inhibitory homeostasis of the brain, the resonance peaks of Glx (contributed by glutamate, glutamine, and GABA together) and Cr (contributed largely by GABA) were obtained at the top of the left frontal lobe by MRS, with the Glx/Cr ratio calculated for each patient before treatment and three months after treatment.

Demographic data were collected from the medical records of included patients, including age, sex, disease course, time of drug initiation and clinical symptoms.

### Statistical analysis

### Sample size

the retrospective nature of the study predetermines the sample size. A priori sample size calculation was not performed.

All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The continuous data were tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Continuous data with a normal distribution were represented as means‚Äâ¬±‚Äâstandard deviations and analyzed using ANOVA and the LSD-t post hoc test. Continuous data with a non-normal distribution were presented as medians (ranges) and analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis H-test. Paired sample _t_-test signed rank sum test was used to compare before and after treatment. Categorical data were presented using n (%) and analyzed using the chi-squared test or Fisher‚Äôs exact test. Two-sided P-values‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05 were considered statistically significant. The graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

Results
-------

According to the inclusion criteria, 97 patients with anti NMDAR encephalitis were included, 2 patients with concomitant tumors were excluded, and 5 patients with incomplete clinical data were excluded. Finally, 90 patients with anti NMDAR encephalitis were enrolled. Patients were grouped according to the adjuvant medications they received: group A (olanzapine group, _n_‚Äâ=‚Äâ36), group B (magnesium valproate group, _n_‚Äâ=‚Äâ30) and group C (lamotrigine group, _n_‚Äâ=‚Äâ24).

### Characteristics of the patients

Ninety patients were included in the study. The olanzapine group consisted of 24 males and 12 females. The patients were 28.50‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ9.29 years old. The median disease course was 9.5 (4.00, 29.05) days. The time to drug initiation was 0 (0, 1) days. The magnesium valproate group included 17 males and 13 females. The patients were 29.97‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ11.71 years old. The disease course was 10 (5, 20) days. The time to drug initiation was 0 (0, 2) days. The lamotrigine group included 13 males and 11 females. They were 33.88‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ9.59 years old. The disease course was 10 (6.25, 17.25) days. The time to drug initiation was 0 (1, 3) days. There were no significant differences in the above indicators among the three groups (all _P_‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05). There were no significant differences in cognitive impairment, motor impairment, speech impairment, autonomic dysfunction, seizures, and decreased consciousness among the three groups before any treatment (all _P_‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05).

### Psychiatric symptoms

Before treatment, there were no significant differences in total PANSS scores, positive symptom scores, negative symptom scores, and general psychopathological scores among the three groups (all _P_‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05). After 3 weeks of treatment, the PANSS total score and positive symptom scores in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were lower than in the olanzapine group (all _P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). The general psychopathological scores in the magnesium valproate group were lower than in the olanzapine and lamotrigine groups after 3 weeks of treatment (_P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). After 3 months of treatment, the PANSS total and negative symptom scores in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were lower than in the olanzapine group (all _P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05).

### Cognitive functions

Among the 90 patients, 22 had missing data regarding the MoCA scores, and a total of 68 patients were included in the evaluation of cognitive performance. Among them, 26 patients were in the olanzapine group, 23 were in the magnesium valproate group, and 19 were in the lamotrigine group. Before treatment, the MoCA scores were 21.35‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.76, 22.39‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4.30, and 22.26‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4.37 in the olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine groups, respectively (_P_‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05). After 3 months of treatment, the MoCA scores in the olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine groups were improved compared with baseline (all _P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Notably, after 3 weeks and 3 months of treatment, the scores in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were higher than in the olanzapine group (all _P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05).

### Functional status of the patients

There were no significant differences in the mRS score among the olanzapine group (0/36, mRS score 0‚Äì1/mRS score‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ2), the magnesium valproate group (0/30), and the lamotrigine group (0/24) before treatment (all _P_‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05). After 3 months of treatment, the proportions of patients with an mRS score 0‚Äì1 in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were significantly higher than in the olanzapine group (all _P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05).

### EEG characteristics

Before treatment, the EEG ranks were 7/29 (No‚Äâ+‚ÄâMi/Mo‚Äâ+‚ÄâSe) in the olanzapine group, 7/23 in the magnesium valproate group, and 5/19 in the lamotrigine group. There were no significant differences among the three groups (_P_‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05). After 3 weeks and 3 months of treatment, the EEG ranks were as follows: 10/26 after 3 weeks and 18/18 after 3 months in the olanzapine group, 11/19 after 3 weeks, and 24/6 after 3 months in the magnesium valproate group, 12/12 after 3 weeks and 21/3 after 3 months in the olanzapine group. There was a significant improvement in the EEG characteristics after 3 weeks and 3 months of treatment (all _P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). The abnormality EEG ranks at 3 months were significantly lower in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups compared with the olanzapine group (all _P_‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05).

### Excitatory/inhibitory rebalance

Compared with the reference range for healthy people, the Glu powers (294.41‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ160.09, 300.55‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ205.34, and 314.46‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ224.11 for the olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine groups, respectively) were increased significantly, and the GABA powers (6.31‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ5.04, 5.92‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4.68, and 5.26‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4.98 for the olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine groups, respectively) were decreased significantly in all three groups before treatment, while no intergroup difference existed at this point. The olanzapine group showed no significant alterations in Glu and GABA power after 3 months of treatment. Compared with the olanzapine group, the power of Glu was significantly decreased after treatment in the magnesium valproate group, whereas the power of GABA was significantly elevated after treatment. Similarly, compared with the olanzapine group, the power of Glu was decreased, and the power of GABA was increased after treatment in the lamotrigine group.

### Cerebral Glx/Cr ratio measured by MRS

The Glx/Cr ratios before treatment were 0.35‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.24, 0.30‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.10, and 0.28‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.20 for the olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine groups, respectively (_P_‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05). After 3 months of treatment, the Glx/Cr ratio in the olanzapine group remained comparable to the pre-treatment levels. However, in the magnesium valproate group, the Glx/Cr ratio significantly decreased, and in the lamotrigine group, it decreased compared to the pre-treatment levels. Furthermore, the Glx/Cr ratios obtained after 3 months of treatment were significantly lower in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups compared to the olanzapine group.

Discussion
----------

The findings of this study indicate that the addition of magnesium valproate or lamotrigine to immunotherapy might be associated with lower PANSS scores and higher MoCA scores compared to olanzapine. It has been observed that patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis show an imbalance between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in the brain. The beneficial effects of magnesium valproate and lamotrigine appear to be associated with restoring the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain.

In patients with anti NMDAR encephalitis, the incidence of epileptic seizures is second only to mental disorders, consistent with previous reports. Other clinical symptoms in the present study included cognitive impairment, autonomic nerve dysfunction, decreased level of consciousness, dyskinesia, and speech disorder, also consistent with clinical characteristics reported in previous studies.

Immunotherapy is the gold standard in the clinical management of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Because the disease often presents with broad and complex neurological and psychiatric symptoms, other central nervous system medicines can be used for anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Along with the mainstay immunotherapy, adjuvant pharmacological intervention to facilitate the homeostasis of neurotransmission in the brain could be beneficial in the clinical management of anti-NMDAR encephalitis by managing specific symptoms related to the imbalance described above.

Olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine are commonly used antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and other psychiatric diseases. Although their specific use in anti-NMDAR encephalitis carries little evidence, they can be used to manage psychiatric symptoms. Compared with olanzapine, magnesium valproate and lamotrigine led to lower scores on the PANSS total score and positive symptom scores after 3 weeks of treatment. The MoCA scores were significantly higher with magnesium valproate and lamotrigine than with olanzapine. The proportions of patients with good clinical outcomes of mRS scores in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were greater than in the olanzapine group after 3 months of treatment.

Olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic agent and exhibits high affinity to many neuroactive receptors, such as serotonin, dopamine Œ±-adrenaline, and histamine, with limited influence on the glutamatergic pathway. Limited evidence (mostly case reports) supports using olanzapine in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, with some effectiveness. Valproate is approved for manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder or for the prevention of migraine headaches; it can competitively inhibit GABA transferase and reduce its metabolism to increase the content of GABA in the brain, which may, in turn, inhibit glutamatergic neurons and reduce glutamate release. The evidence for valproate using in anti-NMDAR encephalitis is also limited but appears favorable, but the use of valproate before an anti-NMDAR encephalitis diagnosis could possibly interfere with the diagnosis. Lamotrigine mainly blocks glutamate release from the presynaptic membrane, inhibiting the excitatory action potential mediated by glutamate and managing seizures. Although lamotrigine has been reported to control the seizures associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, the evidence is limited. Previous evidence suggested that the dysfunction of the glutamatergic pathway is related to the epileptic symptoms of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

However, the mechanism by which NMDAR down-regulation causes complex clinical symptoms in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis remains incompletely understood. Some studies have proposed that besides NMDAR down-regulation and resulting glutamatergic hypofunction, an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission may be involved in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations among patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Accordingly, the present study showed that such imbalances exist based on the Glu, GABA, and Glx/Cr ratio obtained by MRS and compared with reference values obtained from 10,000 healthy individuals in China.

Based on their neuropharmacological characteristics, this study evaluated the clinical benefits of adjuvant administration of olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, particularly about their capability of facilitating the rebalance of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Olanzapine treatment did not alter the Glu and GABA powers in the brain, nor the cortical Glx/Cr ratio, which is consistent with the notion that this drug does not modulate the glutamate system in the brain. On the contrary, adjuvant magnesium valproate lowered the Glu power and the Glx/Cr ratio and elevated GABA power in the cerebrum. Similarly, lamotrigine treatment reduced the power of Glu and Glx/Cr ratio but increased the power of GABA in the brain. Importantly, these above differential neurochemical modulations by the three drugs are associated with measurable differences regarding neurological recovery. Thus, compared with olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine showed better therapeutical effects, as indicated by the assessments on the extent of mitigation of mental symptoms, improvement of cognitive function, better functional outcome, and normalization of EEG features in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

This study had limitations. It was performed at a single hospital and included patients diagnosed over a limited period, resulting in a relatively small sample size. The retrospective nature of the study limited the data that could be analyzed to the ones available in the patient charts. No control group of patients treated with immunotherapy could be included because most patients received adjuvant treatments during the study period. Additional studies with other adjuvant drugs, such as memantine, ketamine, and intrathecal methotrexate, should be carried out to determine the most optimal adjuvant treatments and determine whether specific subgroups of patients could benefit more from a given drug.

Conclusion
----------

This study shows that based on standard immunotherapy, adjuvant therapeutics aiming to correct the cerebral Glu/GABA or excitatory/inhibitory imbalance, such as valproate and lamotrigine, can improve the clinical outcome among patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

- New research from the Universit√© de Montr√©al reveals that metformin, a drug primarily used for type 2 diabetes, may play a crucial role in managing HIV by targeting immune reservoirs. 
- After three months of metformin usage, patients exhibited reduced chronic inflammation and improved immunity, thanks to inhibition of HIV replication via the mTOR pathway. 
- Surprisingly, metformin demonstrated a dual effect by both increasing HIV-infected cells and preventing the virus from escaping. This nuanced interaction highlights the complexity of viral reservoirs and immune response. 
- The study found metformin enhances the BST2 protein levels, which helps the immune system recognize and eliminate HIV-infected cells more effectively through neutralizing antibodies. 
- This encourages the application of a revised ""shock-and-kill"" strategy for HIV eradication, suggesting that metformin could reactivate viral reservoirs in conjunction with existing therapeutic antibodies. 

As researchers embark on clinical trials to explore these findings further, how might this reshape our understanding of treatment strategies for patients with HIV?

==================================================================================

by Bruno Geoffroy, University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre

Metformin, a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, could help deplete the viral reservoir and eliminate it entirely in people living with HIV who receive antiretroviral therapy, Canadian researchers say in a new study.

In 2021, a team led by immunologist Petronela Ancuta of Universit√© de Montr√©al's affiliated hospital research center, the CRCHUM, showed that metformin, when taken for three months, improved patients' immunity and reduced the chronic inflammation usually associated with complications such as cardiovascular disease.

One reason these benefits are so effective is that metformin inhibits the activity of the mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) molecule, which in turn slows down HIV replication in the cells of patients infected with the virus.

In the journal _iScience_, Ancuta and her student Augustine Fert, the study's first author and a recent Ph.D. holder, go further. They studied the molecular mechanisms of action of metformin on HIV replication in CD4 T lymphocytes, which are immune system cells that provide shelter for the virus.

In these reservoirs, HIV keeps on replicating, which contributes to the chronic inflammation by constantly activating the immune system.

""The results of our in vitro tests on cells from people living with HIV and treated with antiretroviral therapy caught us off guard at first,"" said Ancuta. ""They were a bit surprising. We discovered that metformin had both a proviral and an antiviral effect. The drug helped boost the number of HIV-infected cells, while also stopping the virus from escaping the cell.""

Antibodies to the rescue
------------------------

Another benefit of metformin is that it overexpresses the BST2 protein, which acts as a kind of glue to keep virions clinging to the surface of HIV-infected cells. The immune system then spots them and can target them with antibodies.

""Together with my colleague Andr√©s Finzi, we tested the ability of several broad-spectrum neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies to recognize viral reservoir cells after metformin exposure in vitro,"" said Ancuta. ""Some of them recognized the virus very well, suggesting their ability to attract and trigger the destruction of infected cells by NK cells through a process of cellular cytotoxicity.""

These recent scientific advances mean that the ""shock-and-kill"" eradication strategy, often used in the fight against HIV, can be foreseen in a different way, she added.

""In people living with HIV and treated with antiretroviral therapy, we could use metformin to reactivate the reservoir cells responsible for viral replication upon treatment interruption, in combination with antibodies that are already used clinically and well tolerated. These antibodies can then detect the rare infected cells and eliminate them.""

In the next phase of her research, Ancuta plans to launch a clinical trial to validate her in vitro research results, in collaboration with Finzi and their CRCHUM colleague Nicolas Chomont, and Jean-Pierre Routy of the McGill University Health Center Research Institute.

Before she can move forward with this strategy, she will test it in preclinical models.

A phase 3 trial found mirtazapine ineffective in reducing breathlessness in respiratory disease patients, urging caution with off-label antidepressant use.

Mirtazapine may have previously shown promise in the modulation of respiratory sensation, but a new phase 3 study revealed this antidepressant does not improve breathlessness in patients with respiratory disease.

‚ÄúDespite being a widespread issue, we still don‚Äôt have effective treatments available,‚Äù said first author Irene Higginson, FFPHM, from King‚Äôs College London, in a statement. ‚ÄúAs such, many doctors turn to off-label prescribing, trying to help their patients.‚Äù

It has been suggested antidepressants may modulate respiratory sensation even in the absence of a mood disorder by increasing serotonin levels in respiratory control and other centers such as the amygdala. After all, mirtazapine reduces panic, and it is known panic often comes with episodes of severe breathlessness.

Although an earlier trial found sertraline did not affect chronic breathlessness, Higginson and colleagues conducted a study to evaluate whether another antidepressant‚Äîmirtazapine‚Äîwas effective at reducing breathlessness. Findings of BETTER B, an international, multicenter, phase 3, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pragmatic trial, were presented at the ERS Congress in Vienna. The BETTER B trial was conducted in 16 centers in Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, and the UK and was informed by a feasibility trial published in 2020.

The primary outcome was the reduction of self-reported worst breathlessness over the past 24 hours, measured at day 56, compared with placebo. Secondary outcomes included the worst breathlessness at various times, average breathlessness, number and duration of breathlessness episodes, and physical and emotional aspects of breathlessness such as dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function, and quality life. Another secondary outcome was symptoms and concerns evaluated by the integrated palliative care outcome scale.

The sample, screened between February 4, 2021, and March 28, 2024, were aged ‚â• 18 years (mean age: 74 years); had either COPD, interstitial lung diseases, or both; and were grade 3 or 4 of the modified Medical Research Council breathlessness scale. All participants were stable for the previous 2 weeks before baseline and on optimal treatment for reversible causes of breathlessness, determined by the referring clinician and best clinical guidance. People were excluded from the study if they had existing use of antidepressants or serotonergic active substances, had known contraindications to mirtazapine, or received an Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Scale score of ‚â§ 40 which indicates they are in bed ‚â• 50% of the time.

Participants (n = 225) were randomized 1:1 to receive either mirtazapine or placebo daily for 56 days. They had a dose of 15 mg orally for the first 14 days. After that, there were 2 assessments for dose escalations, at days 14 and 28. Participants had their dose increased to 30 mg at day 14 and to 45 mg at day 28 if they did not show improvement in their breathlessness, measured using the Numerical Rating Scale over the previous 24 hours. At the end of day 56, the dose was tapered and discontinued.

Investigators assessed participants at baseline and at days 7, 14, 28, 56, and 7 days after completing the trial to assess for safety and toxicity of the treatment. Participants were called 180 days from baseline by phone, video call, or mail to complete the last self-reported questionnaire. Caregivers completed questionnaires at days 28, 56, and 180.

At day 14, nearly half (48%) of participants on mirtazapine had escalation, compared with 53% on placebo. At day 28, 35% participants on mirtazapine had escalation, which was slightly less than those on placebo (36%).

At day 56, 3 participants on mirtazapine and 2 on placebo died. At day 180, the number of people who died was 6% in the mirtazapine arm and 10% in the placebo arm. In total, 5 participants were lost to follow-up, with 3% in the mirtazapine arm and 2% in the placebo arm.

Investigators did not observe a difference in worst breathlessness score day 56 between mirtazapine and placebo (difference in adjusted mean score [mirtazapine minus placebo], 0.105; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.407 to 0.618; P = .69). The sensitivity analysis, to account for missing data, also found no evidence of a difference between treatment arms (difference in adjusted mean score; 0.232; 95% CI, -9.308 to 0.773; P = .40). Secondary outcomes also demonstrated no differences between the arms in terms of measures of breathlessness, overall palliative symptoms, average breathlessness score, chronic respiratory questionnaire subscales, anxiety and depression, number and duration of breathlessness, Australia-modified Karnofsky performance scale, and generalized-efficacy scale.

The study reported 215 adverse events in 64% participants on mirtazapine and 40% on placebo, with the most common ones in the mirtazapine arm being dry mouth, somnolence, fatigue, and sedation. Serious adverse events occurred in 5% of participants on mirtazapine and 6% on placebo.

‚ÄúThis new trial concludes that mirtazapine is not recommended for the treatment of breathlessness, that the use of unlicensed medicines should be approached with caution and that it‚Äôs crucial to subject medicines in palliative care to rigorous trials,‚Äù Higginson said.

The next-generation radiopharmaceutical ABD-147 was previously granted FDA fast track designation in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

ABD-147, a next-generation precision radiopharmaceutical, has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of neuroendocrine carcinoma.

With this designation, Abdera Therapeutics, the sponsor, can be eligible for incentives like tax credits for clinical trials, exemption from user fees, and a potential 7 years of market exclusivity.

‚ÄúNeuroendocrine carcinomas, including SCLC and LCNEC, are aggressive and challenging to treat effectively with current systemic therapies,‚Äù said Philippe Bishop, MD, chief medical officer of Abdera Therapeutics, in a press release. ‚ÄúBy delivering a potent radioisotope to neuroendocrine tumors expressing DLL3 with custom-engineered pharmacokinetic properties, we believe ABD-147 has the potential to become a best-in-class DLL3-targeting treatment for aggressive neuroendocrine tumors.‚Äù

In July 2024, the FDA also granted fast track designation to ABD-147 in extensive-stage SCLC. The fast track designation is intended to facilitate the development and review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill unmet needs. The designation provides the sponsor with more frequent communication with the FDA as well as eligibility for accelerated approval and priority review.

This year, Abdera will begin a phase 1, first-in-human study evaluating ABD-147 in LCNEC and SCLC that has been previously treated with platinum-based therapy.

ABD-147 is designed to deliver actininum-225 to DLL3-expressing tumors. DLL3 is upregulated in some high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas, including SCLC, while it is typically absent on the surface of nonmalignant cells, making it an attractive target for radiotherapy.

In QWINT-2, efsitora helped adults na√Øve to insulin therapy currently using and not using GLP-1 receptor agonists achieve an A1C below 7%

Detailed results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and simultaneously presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting 2024

INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced detailed results from the QWINT-2 phase 3 trial evaluating once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora) compared to once-daily insulin degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes using insulin for the first time (insulin na√Øve). The data were published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and simultaneously presented today at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting 2024.

In the trial, efsitora met the primary endpoint of non-inferior A1C reduction. For the efficacy estimand, efsitora reduced A1C by 1.34% compared to 1.26% for insulin degludec resulting in an A1C of 6.87% and 6.95% respectively at 52 weeks.

Additionally, participants taking efsitora achieved 45 minutes more time in range per day, a key secondary endpoint, without additional time in hypoglycemia (glucose <54 mg/dL) in comparison to insulin degludec for the efficacy estimand.

""Traditionally, basal insulins are dosed once a day ‚Äî a treatment schedule that can make compliance difficult for a significant portion of people living with type 2 diabetes,"" said Carol Wysham, M.D., clinical professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine. ""Efsitora has the potential to address treatment burden and improve adherence ‚Äî all while lowering A1C. These results can make a significant impact for people living with type 2 diabetes looking for a once-weekly option that provides similar outcomes as daily insulins.""

""For the past century, we've been searching for the next scientific breakthrough that would alleviate the complexity that comes with starting insulin treatment,"" said Jeff Emmick, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president, product development, Lilly. ""With these results, we believe we're headed towards a future where people with type 2 diabetes who use basal insulin can achieve their desired results with a simple treatment option like efsitora.""

In the trial, efsitora demonstrated a safety profile similar to daily insulins. There were no severe hypoglycemic events reported during treatment with efsitora compared to six reported with insulin degludec. Overall hypoglycemia rates in the study were low, with estimated combined rates of severe or clinically significant (blood glucose <54 mg/dL) hypoglycemic events per patient-year of exposure of 0.58 with efsitora vs. 0.45 with insulin degludec. Estimated combined rates of severe or clinically significant nocturnal hypoglycemic events per patient-year of exposure were 0.08 with both efsitora and insulin degludec. Additionally, rates of hypoglycemia were similar among people currently using GLP-1s and those not using GLP-1s. Adverse events were similar between treatment groups in the trial.

Detailed results for QWINT-5 are also being presented at EASD and simultaneously published in The Lancet.

**About the QWINT clinical trial program**  
The QWINT phase 3 global clinical development program for insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora) in diabetes began in 2022 and has enrolled more than 4,000 people living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes across five global registration studies.

QWINT-2 (NCT05362058) was a parallel-design, open-label, treat-to-target, randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of efsitora as a once-weekly basal insulin to insulin degludec for 52 weeks in insulin-na√Øve adults with type 2 diabetes. The trial randomized 928 participants across the U.S., Brazil, Canada, China, Czechia (Czech Republic), Germany, Greece, Japan, Korea, Mexico and Puerto Rico to receive efsitora once weekly or insulin degludec once daily administered subcutaneously. The primary objective of the trial was to demonstrate non-inferiority in reducing A1C at week 52 with efsitora compared to insulin degludec. The trial was also designed to assess efficacy and safety for patients using and not using GLP-1 receptor agonists.

**About insulin efsitora alfa**  
Insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora) is a once-weekly basal insulin, a fusion protein that combines a novel single-chain variant of insulin with a human IgG2 Fc domain. It is specifically designed for once-weekly subcutaneous administration, and with its low peak-to-trough ratio, it has the potential to provide more stable glucose levels (less glucose variability) throughout the week. Efsitora is in phase 3 development for adults with type 1 and 2 diabetes.

Here are some practical insights from recent guidelines that can enhance your clinical practice:

- UNDERSTANDING PCOS: This multifactorial condition is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and the presence of polycystic ovaries. Recognition of these symptoms is essential for diagnosis. 

- DIAGNOSIS CRITERIA: Effective diagnosis now centers on the presence of two out of three criteria: clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound or elevated serum anti-M√ºllerian hormone (AMH) levels. 

- LONG-TERM RISKS: It's vital to inform patients of potential long-term health risks, including increased likelihood of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular issues. Regular screenings for these conditions should be part of management plans.  

- WEIGHT MANAGEMENT: Encourage patients to engage in lifestyle modifications, including weight loss and exercise. These changes can significantly improve metabolic profiles and fertility outcomes, regardless of overall BMI.

- TAILORED TREATMENTS: There is no one-size-fits-all treatment. Options range from hormonal contraceptives to anti-androgens based on individual symptoms, with tailored management yielding the best results. 

- METFORMIN USE: In primary care, consider metformin for patients with PCOS who have insulin resistance. This off-label use can aid metabolic outcomes, but ensure your patients are informed of its potential side effects.

As we strive to improve outcomes for women with PCOS, how can we better utilize these guidelines in our practices? Let's discuss!

**Dr Roger Henderson Provides Seven Top Tips for Primary Care Practitioners on the Diagnosis and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome**

Continue Reading Below

Read This Article to Learn More About:

*   the causes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and when to suspect it
*   approaches to the diagnosis and management of PCOS
*   the treatments available to reduce hyperandrogenism or to induce fertility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was first described in 1935 as Stein‚ÄìLeventhal syndrome by the American gynaecologists Irving Stein and Michael Leventhal, who associated the presence of ovarian cysts with anovulation. PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age, and is a well-known cause of infertility and complications in pregnancy. It is associated with a range of health issues, including insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, steatotic liver disease, and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

In the UK, up to one in three women have more than 10 follicles per ovary visible on ultrasound, a condition known as polycystic ovaries; in turn, one in three women with polycystic ovaries will have PCOS. In addition to polycystic ovaries, women with PCOS may have one or more of a group of characteristic features‚Äîincluding acne, male-pattern baldness, hirsutism, amenorrhoea, and oligomenorrhoea‚Äîand raised serum levels of testosterone and/or luteinising hormone (LH).

### The Burden of PCOS

The burden of PCOS on women affected by it can be significant. At one time, it was considered to be mainly a reproductive condition, but it is now accepted that women with PCOS are at high risk of metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, women with PCOS have been shown to have an increased risk of psychological morbidity, asthma, and migraine.

### Guidance on PCOS

Although no NICE Guideline has been published specifically on PCOS, the condition is covered in NICE Clinical Guideline 156, _Fertility problems: assessment and treatment_, and further guidance on the symptoms, diagnosis, and management of PCOS is available from other sources, including:

*   the _International evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome 2023_
    *   summary of recommendations
    *   full guidance
*   the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE)/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) Workshop Group
*   the Androgen Excess Society
*   the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
*   the _British National Formulary._

This article provides seven top tips for primary care practitioners on the causes of PCOS and when to suspect it, approaches to its diagnosis and management, and best practice regarding its treatment.

1\. Be Aware That the Causes of PCOS Remain Unclear
---------------------------------------------------

PCOS is reportedly present in around 5‚Äì15% of women of reproductive age. However, its prevalence rises to as much as 20% when the diagnostic criteria proposed by the ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group (termed the ‚Äò2003 Rotterdam Criteria‚Äô) are used.

The causes of PCOS remain unclear, but the condition is multifactorial and appears to be inherited as a common, complex genetic disorder. Insulin resistance is found in approximately 65‚Äì80% of women with PCOS, independent of obesity, and is worsened by excess weight triggered by the condition. Levels of LH are increased in nearly 40% of women with PCOS because of increased production from the anterior pituitary gland. Theca cells in the ovaries produce excess androgens because of hyperinsulinaemia or increased serum levels of LH, and women with PCOS may also have increased serum oestrogen levels. As a result of continued exposure to oestrogen unopposed by progesterone, the endometrium may become hyperplastic, and testosterone is also converted to oestrogen in peripheral fat.

2\. Recognise That no Formal Classification System for PCOS Currently Exists
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although no formal classification system currently exists for PCOS, proposals have been made to establish one.

Box 1: Phenotypes of PCOS

*   **Mild PCOS (16% of women with PCOS)**‚Äîcharacterised by irregular periods, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, mildly raised androgen concentrations, and normal insulin concentrations
*   **Ovulatory PCOS (16% of women with PCOS)**‚Äîcharacterised by normal periods, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, high androgen concentrations, and increased insulin concentrations
*   **Hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation (7% of women with PCOS)**‚Äîcharacterised by irregular periods, normal ovaries on ultrasound, high androgen concentrations, and increased insulin concentrations; this phenotype has potential long-term risks
*   **Severe PCOS (61% of women with PCOS)**‚Äîcharacterised by irregular periods, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, high androgen concentrations, and increased insulin concentrations; this phenotype also has potential long-term risks.

Current guidance recommends that PCOS should be diagnosed using the international evidence-based guideline criteria, which build on the consensus-based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. These require the presence of two of the following to diagnose PCOS:

*   clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism
*   ovulatory dysfunction
*   polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.

Alternatively, assessment of serum anti-M√ºllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound, provided that other aetiologies are also excluded. Importantly, when irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is now simplified, and ultrasound or AMH are not required. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended because of poor specificity. Note that, according to the 2003 Rotterdam criteria, a diagnosis of PCOS can only be made when other causes have been ruled out, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumours, or Cushing‚Äôs syndrome.

The international evidence-based guideline criteria differ slightly from those issued in 2006 by the Androgen Excess Society, which require all of the following to be present for a diagnosis of PCOS to be made:

*   hyperandrogenism‚Äîhirsutism and/or hyperandrogenaemia
*   ovarian dysfunction‚Äîoligo-ovulation or anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries
*   exclusion of other androgen excess or related disorders.

3\. Know That a Diagnosis of PCOS is One of Exclusion
-----------------------------------------------------

Common features of PCOS include hirsutism (present in 60% of women), acne (present in 15‚Äì25%), scalp hair loss or male-pattern baldness (present in 5%), irregular and infrequent periods, weight gain or difficulty losing weight, and infertility. Acanthosis nigricans may also be present, especially in obese women with PCOS, and is thought to be linked to insulin resistance. Less commonly, there may be deepening of the voice, clitoromegaly, and increased muscle mass.

Symptoms typically begin at the time of puberty and, in younger women, may be difficult to distinguish from the irregular menses that often occur in the first year after menarche. Although the diagnostic criteria for PCOS during adolescence are controversial, guidelines recommend that both ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism must be present to diagnose PCOS in adolescents.

Body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio should be checked in all women with PCOS, as 40‚Äì80% of women with the syndrome are overweight or obese, with central obesity predominating (a waist-to-hip ratio of at least 0.85, or waist circumference of at least 88 cm). Blood pressure should also be monitored, as women with PCOS may have elevated blood pressure.

Differential diagnoses of PCOS are presented in Box 2.

Box 2: Differential Diagnoses of PCOS

*   Hypothyroidism
*   Hyperprolactinaemia
*   Acromegaly
*   Cushing‚Äôs syndrome and androgen-secreting tumours
*   Iatrogenic side effects from medication causing hirsutism such as danazol, high-dose corticosteroids, ciclosporin, and phenytoin.

4\. Understand That Investigations for PCOS Consist of Endocrine Tests and Ovarian Imaging
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The three main endocrine abnormalities in PCOS are:

*   elevated serum LH levels, with normal serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels
*   elevated free testosterone levels (a combination of increased testosterone production and reduced sex hormone-binding globulin), and
*   insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinaemia.

Women with PCOS typically have a serum testosterone level above 2.5 nmol/l and a serum LH level above 10 IU/l. If the total testosterone level is above 5 nmol/l, always check for other possible causes of androgen hypersecretion, such as androgen-secreting adrenal or ovarian tumours, or nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Fasting plasma glucose and/or glycated haemoglobin are useful for assessing insulin resistance. Although these tests are less accurate than the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), they are acceptable alternatives if an OGTT cannot be performed. A lipid profile should also be obtained to evaluate cardiovascular risk. Prolactin testing is recommended to exclude hyperprolactinaemia, which may present with oligo-ovulation or anovulation. In addition, thyroid function tests are important because thyroid dysfunction may present with oligo-ovulation or anovulation, or irregular and heavy menstrual bleeding, and weight gain.

Ultrasound is used to assess for the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology, unless the diagnosis of PCOS is obvious on clinical and biochemical grounds. When appropriate, transvaginal ultrasound provides higher-resolution images of the ovaries compared with transabdominal ultrasound. Remember that the presence of polycystic ovaries alone does not confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasound should not be used to diagnose PCOS in adolescents and, in adults, it should ideally be done in the early follicular phase (days 3‚Äì5) after a spontaneous or progestin-withdrawal-induced menstruation. If menstrual bleeding is infrequent or reduced, ultrasound can be done at any time. If endometrial thickening is found on imaging, an endometrial biopsy is indicated to determine whether endometrial hyperplasia or cancer is present.

5\. Inform Women About Possible Long-term Risks and Lifestyle Interventions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Healthcare professionals should inform women with PCOS about the potential long-term health risks that are associated with the syndrome. Obesity, dyslipidaemia, and insulin resistance all increase cardiovascular risk, and screening should be offered for impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes.

Women diagnosed with PCOS should be advised about weight loss and exercise, as weight loss improves fertility and pregnancy outcomes, psychological symptoms, and metabolic risk‚Äîeven if BMI remains raised. A low-glycaemic-index diet may be helpful in managing PCOS. Hypertension should be treated in the usual way, although there is no rationale for the routine use of statins in women with PCOS outside normal guidelines.

6\. Consider the Range of Available Treatments
----------------------------------------------

No single treatment can reverse the hormonal changes of PCOS or address all of its clinical features; therefore, medical management should be tailored to each individual‚Äôs specific symptoms. The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) is one of the treatments often considered, provided that there are no contraindications. It should be prescribed with the usual guidance about risks, side effects, and potential drug interactions. However, COCPs containing 35 mcg ethinyloestradiol and cyproterone acetate should not be used as a first-line treatment for PCOS because of their potential adverse effects, which include venous thromboembolism.

If acne is a significant issue, topical retinoids or antibiotics and/or oral antibiotics can be prescribed as appropriate. If hirsutism is present, hair removal methods, such as waxing or shaving, should be discussed. In general, the oral contraceptive pill is more effective for acne than for hirsutism in PCOS.

In women with prolonged amenorrhoea or abnormal vaginal bleeding, a cyclical progestogen should be prescribed to induce a withdrawal bleed, followed by a referral for a transvaginal ultrasound to assess endometrial thickness. If endometrial thickening is present, clinicians should refer women for endometrial sampling to exclude endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. If the endometrium is normal, women should be advised on treatment to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and its associated risks. These options include a low-dose COCP, a cyclical progestogen, or a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD). If a woman is unwilling to take cyclical hormone treatment or use the LNG-IUD, specialist advice should be sought, as regular ultrasound is required to assess endometrial thickness.

If a woman with PCOS presents with infertility and wishes to conceive, NICE Clinical Guideline 156, _Fertility problems: assessment and treatment_, recommends that‚Äîafter weight loss (when indicated) and a full fertility work-up‚Äîtreatment should include clomifene citrate, metformin, or a combination of both. Clomifene citrate appears to be preferable to metformin for ovulation induction in women with obesity and PCOS.

7\. Keep in Mind That Metformin is Used Off Label to Treat PCOS
---------------------------------------------------------------

In primary care, when considering starting metformin in women with PCOS but without diabetes, clinicians should consider seeking specialist advice, as metformin is not currently licensed for this indication. The _International evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS 2023_, issued by the International PCOS Network, makes the following recommendations on the use of metformin for indications not relating to fertility:

*   in addition to lifestyle interventions, metformin alone should be considered in women with a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2 for anthropometric and metabolic outcomes, including insulin resistance, glucose, and lipid profiles
*   in combination with a COCP, metformin may be most beneficial in high metabolic risk groups, including women with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m¬≤, diabetes risk factors, and/or impaired glucose tolerance, and/or who have a high-risk ethnic background.

If metformin is initiated in primary care, off-label use should be explained alongside the fact that adverse effects may occur, such as gastrointestinal symptoms and reduced vitamin B12 levels.

Summary
-------

PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age, as well as being a major cause of infertility and pregnancy complications. It gives rise to symptoms of hyperandrogenism, the presence of hyperandrogenaemia, oligo-ovulation or anovulation, and polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound. It is strongly associated with complications including insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, steatotic liver disease, and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The main aims of treatment are to reduce hyperandrogenism and to induce fertility. Primary care doctors are in an ideal position to identify women with symptoms and signs of PCOS early, and by doing so help to reduce the significant burden that PCOS can place on people with the condition.

Key Points 

*   PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age, and a well-known cause of infertility and pregnancy complications
*   In the UK, up to one in three women have more than 10 follicles per ovary visible on ultrasound (polycystic ovaries), and one in three women with polycystic ovaries will have PCOS
*   PCOS is defined as the presence of polycystic ovaries together with one or more characteristic features, including acne, male-pattern baldness, hirsutism, amenorrhoea, and oligomenorrhoea, and raised serum levels of testosterone and/or LH
*   The cause of PCOS is unclear, but it is multifactorial and inherited as a common, complex genetic disorder
*   Insulin resistance is found in approximately 65‚Äì80% of women with PCOS, independent of obesity, and is exacerbated by excess weight triggered by the condition
*   LH levels are increased in nearly 40% of women with PCOS because of increased production from the anterior pituitary gland
*   Women with PCOS may also have increased serum oestrogen and testosterone levels
*   Investigations for PCOS consist of endocrine tests and ovarian imaging
*   Ultrasound is used to assess the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology, unless the diagnosis of PCOS is obvious on clinical and biochemical grounds
*   No single treatment can reverse the hormonal changes of PCOS or address all of its clinical features, so medical management should be tailored to each individual‚Äôs symptoms
*   Metformin, in combination with a combined oral contraceptive pill, may offer greater benefit in high metabolic risk groups, including women with a BMI >30 kg/m¬≤, diabetes risk factors, and/or impaired glucose tolerance, and/or from high-risk ethnic groups
*   If metformin is initiated in primary care, off-label use should be explained alongside the fact that adverse effects may occur, such as gastrointestinal symptoms and reduced vitamin B12 levels.

**Implementation Actions for ICSs**

**written by Dr David Jenner, GP, Cullompton, Devon**

The following implementation actions are designed to support ICSs with the challenges involved in implementing new guidance at a system level. Our aim is to help you to consider how to deliver improvements to healthcare within the available resources.

*   **Review** local care pathways for the investigation and management of PCOS to ensure that they include screening for comorbidities like type 2 diabetes
*   **Update** local care pathways in line with the latest guidance, with triggers for referral to specialist care and required investigations
*   **Consider** creating a specific ‚Äòsuspected PCOS‚Äô blood test request group in pathology request systems to ensure that the required set of biochemical tests are performed
*   **Identify** on- and off-label therapies in formularies to assist in symptom management and endometrial protection
*   **Make sure** that clear guidance is available to ensure endometrial protection because of the increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer
*   **Signpost** to patient-centred resources to help patients understand PCOS and encourage weight loss and self-help.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

Universal testing identified germline pathogenic variants in 7.3% of women with breast cancer, suggesting that traditional risk-based criteria may miss more than a third of _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, or _PALB2_ carriers.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Traditional risk-based criteria, including family history and ancestry, are used to guide genetic testing decisions in women with breast cancer. However, these criteria may overlook patients with actionable genetic variants, particularly those outside the typical risk profile.
*   To assess the efficacy of universal genetic testing, researchers conducted a cross-sectional study that included 729 women (median age at diagnosis, 53 years; 65.4% White women) newly diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between September 2019 and April 2022 at three Canadian institutions.
*   All patients received genetic counseling followed by testing for the presence of germline pathogenic variants in 17 breast cancer susceptibility genes. The primary gene panel included screening for _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, and _PALB2_¬†and the optional secondary panel included 14 additional breast cancer susceptibility genes.
*   Of the participants, 659 (90.4%) were tested for both primary and secondary gene panels, whereas 70 (9.6%) underwent testing for only the primary panel. The majority of the cohort (66.8) were diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER)‚Äìpositive breast cancer, while 15.4% had triple-negative breast cancer.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   The prevalence of germline pathogenic variants was 7.3% (53 patients) ‚Äî 5.3% for the¬†primary gene panel and 2.1% for the secondary panel.
*   Younger age (< 40 years; odds ratio \[OR\], 6.83), family history of ovarian cancer (OR, 9.75), high-grade disease (OR, 1.68), and triple-negative breast cancer (OR, 3.19) were independently associated with the presence of pathogenic genetic variants in _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, or _PALB2_.
*   Overall, 34.3% of patients with germline pathogenic variants in _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, or _PALB2,_ and 85.7% of carriers of secondary panel variants would not have qualified for traditional genetic testing according to the current risk factors.
*   A total of 13 patients with _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, or _PALB2_¬†variants had confirmed pathogenic mutations and were eligible for poly(adenosine diphosphate‚Äìribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

These findings have ""informed our clinical practice, and we now offer mainstream, oncology-led genetic testing to all women diagnosed with incident invasive breast cancer younger than 50 years of age, those with triple-negative breast cancer and/or bilateral breast cancer, those potentially eligible for PARP inhibitors,"" as well as to men with breast cancer, the authors wrote.

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study was led by Zoulikha Rezoug, MSc, Lady Davis Institute of the Jewish General Hospital, McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was [published online](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2823091) on September 3, 2024, in _JAMA Network Open_.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 6-month recruitment pause. Adjustments in recruitment criteria, focus on younger patients and those with triple-negative breast cancer could have overestimated prevalence of genetic pathogenic variants among women aged ‚â• 70 years.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The study was supported by grants from the Jewish General Hospital Foundation and the Quebec Breast Cancer Foundation, as well as an award from the Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Sant√©. Two authors reported receiving grants or personal fees from various sources.

2024-09-11 09:00:00,2024-09-11 13:04:53,"ü§î Could our approach to treating pediatric strep throat be due for a shift?

- A recent study involving 88 children aged 3-15 years with group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis found that amoxicillin did not significantly shorten fever duration compared to placebo. In fact, both fever length and pain intensity showed no major differences between the two groups.

- üìä Interestingly, the placebo group had a higher rate of positive throat cultures at day 30 (relative risk of 4.44), suggesting that antibiotics may not be as essential as previously thought in uncomplicated cases.

- This leads to a crucial takeaway: In regions with good access to healthcare, a more cautious approach towards antibiotic prescribing might be warranted. Active follow-up combined with a stepwise prescription strategy could help mitigate unnecessary antibiotic use and its associated risks.

As healthcare professionals, how do we strike the right balance between treating our young patients and preventing antibiotic resistance? Let's discuss!

Clinical Summary

Antibiotics May Not Reduce Fever Duration in Paediatric Strep Throat
====================================================================

Jenny Blair | 11 September 2024

TOPLINE:
--------

For children with group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis, amoxicillin appears to be no more effective than placebo at reducing fever duration, pain intensity, and complication rates.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   A randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority clinical trial of 88 children aged 3-15 years with uncomplicated GAS pharyngitis.
*   Participants were randomised to 6 days' amoxicillin (weight-based dosing) vs placebo.
*   The primary outcome was the fever duration.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Fever duration as well as pain did not differ significantly between groups.
*   There were six treatment failures in the placebo group and two in the amoxicillin group, also a non-significant difference.
*   However, in a subgroup analysis of culture-confirmed participants, the rate of positive throat cultures at day 30 was much higher in the placebo group (relative risk, 4.44; 95% CI, 1.48-13.26).

IN PRACTICE:¬†
-------------

""...An active follow-up with a stepwise approach to antibiotic prescription seems reasonable in countries \[with\] prompt access to healthcare and medication,"" the authors wrote. ""Overall, our findings support a more restrictive attitude towards prescribing antibiotics.""

SOURCE:
-------

Conducted by a Swiss team, the study appeared in _European Journal of Pediatrics_.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Many parents were reluctant to allow participation and recruitment stopped well short of goal. Small sample sizes resulted in wide confidence intervals.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

The study was funded by the University of Geneva, Gertrude Von Meissner Foundation, Geneva University Hospitals, and Soci√©t√© Acad√©mique de Gen√®ve. The authors declared they had no conflicts of interest.

- A recent study involving the HYPOAGE cohort examined insulin-treated patients aged 75+ with type 2 diabetes, identifying significant pitfalls in current definitions of ""diabetes overtreatment.""
- Notably, 19% and 40% of patients were classified as overtreated using fixed and individualized HbA1c targets (< 7.0%, < 7.5%, and < 8.0%) respectively. 
- However, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) revealed that nearly all participants experienced time below the target range (TBR) exceeding 1%, regardless of their overtreatment status. üìâ 
- Alarmingly, both proxy definitions had low sensitivity (20% and 41%) and accuracy (27% and 44%) when it came to predicting hypoglycemia risk.

Given these findings, it‚Äôs becoming increasingly clear that revision of existing overtreatment definitions is essential for better safeguarding older adults on insulin therapy. How can we refine our strategies to minimize hypoglycemia while managing diabetes effectively in this vulnerable population? ü§î

OBJECTIVE

To assess the accuracy of ‚Äúdiabetes overtreatment‚Äù proxy definitions in predicting hypoglycemia in older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Inclusion of patients from HYPOAGE cohort with insulin-treated T2D, aged ‚â•75 years, and using a continuous glycemic monitoring (CGM) device for 28 days. ‚ÄúDiabetes overtreatment‚Äù was defined as HbA1c < 7.0% (fixed proxy definition) or as HbA1c < 7.0%, 7.5% and 8.0% according to patient‚Äôs health status (individualized proxy definition). The primary outcome was time below range (TBR) ‚â• 1%.

RESULTS

Of the 134 patients included (81.6 ¬± 5.4 years, 59% male), 25 (19%) and 53 (40%) were overtreated, based on fixed and individualized proxy definitions, respectively. CGM data showed TBR >1% in nearly all patients regardless of overtreatment status. Both proxy definitions had low sensitivity (20% [14%; 29%] and 41% [32%; 50%]) and accuracy (27% [20%; 35%] and 44% [35%; 53%]) in predicting hypoglycemia.

CONCLUSIONS

A revised definition of diabetes overtreatment is needed to better manage older insulin-treated patients and protect them from hypoglycemia.",gpt-4o-mini,aKxa0A8JMU1ptQQse8S4

Piflufolastat (18F) is being produced at 2 Curium facilities in Madrid and 1 in Sevilla.

Piflufolastat (18F) (Pylclari; (18F)-DCFPyL) is now available in Spain for the detection of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lesions with PET in patients with prostate cancer, according to a news release from Curium, the developer of the agent.

Piflufolastat (18F) was approved in the United States in May 2021.

The tracer is being produced at 2 Curium facilities in Madrid and 1 in Sevilla.

Piflufolastat (18F) is an 18F-PSMA PET tracer indicated for use in the primary staging of patients with high-risk prostate cancer prior to initial curative therapy as well as to localize recurrence of prostate cancer in patients with suspected recurrence based on an increasing serum PSA level following primary treatment with curative intent.

‚ÄúThe availability of PYLCLARI in Spain is an important milestone for patients with prostate cancer and underscores our dedication to improving the choice of diagnostic PET radiopharmaceuticals,‚Äù said Benoit Woessmer, PET Europe CEO at Curium, in the news release. ‚ÄúAs we continue to redefine the experience of cancer through our trusted legacy in nuclear medicine, we are proud that the availability of PYLCLARI continues to grow and now covers 7 countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain.‚Äù

These commercial expansions come after a July 2023 decision by the European Commission to grant marketing authorization to piflufolastat (18F) in the European Union. Since then, the first commercial doses of piflufolastat (18F) have been offered in Greece in November 2023, Italy in February 2024, the Netherlands in March 2024, Germany and France in May 2024, Austria in June 2024, and now Spain.

The diagnostic also received FDA approval in the United States in May 2021.

### Data on piflufolastat (18F)

Piflufolastat (18F) (Pylarify) was approved in the United States in May 2021 based on data from the phase 3 OSPREY (NCT02981368) and CONDOR (NCT03739684) trials, which demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the tracer in different clinical settings.

Both trials enrolled patients with prostate cancer who were given a single dose of piflufolastat (18F) for the study.

In total, the OSPREY trial enrolled 385 patients who were divided into 2 cohorts: cohort A, consisting of 252 evaluable patients with high-risk prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy, and cohort B, consisting of 93 evaluable patients with suspected recurrent/metastatic prostate cancer on conventional imaging.

Data from the trial showed high specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) with piflufolastat (18F) prior to initial therapy. In cohort A, the median specificity with piflufolastat (18F) was 97.9% among 3 readers, and the median sensitivity was 40.3%. The median PPV and the median negative predictive value with the diagnostic was 86.7% and 83.2%, respectively.

In cohort B of the study, the median sensitivity of the agent was 95.8%, and the PPV for extraprostatic lesions was 81.9%.

The agent was also studied in the phase 3 CONDOR study, which enrolled 208 men with prostate cancer with uninformative baseline imaging and a median baseline PSA of 0.8 ng/mL. The primary end point was correct localization rate (CLR), defined as PPV with anatomic lesion colocalization between piflufolastat (18F) and a composite standard of truth.

Data from the trial showed high rates of CLR and detection with piflufolastat (18F) in patients with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer, including in those with low PSA values. Overall, the CLR was found to be 84.8% to 87.0%. The disease detection rate, defined as 1 lesion detected per patient by piflufolastat (18F) by central readers, was 59% to 66%. Among all patients, 63.9% had a change in intended management following piflufolastat (18F).

Adverse events from both trials were observed among 2% or less of patients, which included headache, dysgeusia, and fatigue. One patient with a history of allergic reactions also reported experiencing a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the treatment.

September 9, 2024

By Abigail Brooks, MA

Patients with positive endoscopic findings for upper gastrointestinal mucosal damage had a greater risk of developing Parkinson disease compared to those without mucosal damage.

A history of upper gastrointestinal mucosal damage may be associated with a greater risk of developing Parkinson disease (PD), according to findings from a recent study.

The study was published in JAMA Network Open and leveraged data for nearly 20,000 patients who underwent upper endoscopy with biopsy from a Mass General Brigham-based electronic database. Results showed those with positive endoscopic findings for mucosal damage had a greater risk of being diagnosed with PD compared to those without mucosal damage.

According to the World Health Organization, the prevalence of PD has doubled in the past 25 years, and global estimates showed more than 8.5 million individuals were living with PD in 2019. A neurodegenerative disorder predominately affecting dopaminergic neurons in the brain, PD causes problems with movement, mental health, sleep, pain, and other health issues. Although emerging research suggests PD results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and although a gut-first hypothesis has gained traction, the exact cause of PD is not known.

‚ÄúA significant gap remains in understanding the relationship between broader upper GI mucosal damage, such as peptic ulcer disease and erosions, and the development of Parkinson disease, as most studies to date have focused on correlational links to a history of H pylori infection,‚Äù Trisha Pasricha, MD, MPH, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and colleagues wrote.

To determine the association between gastrointestinal mucosal damage and subsequent risk of being diagnosed with PD, investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing upper endoscopy with biopsy between January 2000 and December 2005, with final follow-up assessments completed by July 31, 2023. The study was conducted within the Mass General Brigham system, and patients were selected using the Research Patient Data Registry, a Mass General Brigham-based electronic database storing data on patient demographics, encounters, medications, procedures, and billing codes.

Using the search query tool, investigators identified a cohort of 18,305 patients who had a history of upper endoscopy with biopsy between 2000 and 2005 and no history of PD prior to initial upper endoscopy, 11,293 of whom were included in the study. Patients with positive endoscopic findings for mucosal damage, including erosions, esophagitis, ulcers, and peptic injury, were matched in a 1:3 ratio to patients without mucosal damage based on age, sex, and date of upper endoscopy.

Each participant was followed up until a diagnosis of Parkinson disease; death; or, in the absence of a PD diagnosis, censoring at an outpatient appointment with no subsequent follow-up for > 2 years, representing loss to follow-up, or until July 31, 2023. Investigators identified cases of PD through ICD-9 codes confirmed by a history of PD-specific prescriptions.

Investigators additionally conducted 2 nested case-control analyses, including one within the group of patients previously found without mucosal damage and the second within the group of patients previously found to have mucosal damage. In both nested analyses, cases were matched to controls without PD in a 1:2 ratio based on age at upper endoscopy, sex, and date of each case‚Äôs PD diagnosis by incidence density sampling.

Of the 11,293 patients included in the study, 9350 were included in the Cox proportional hazards model. Among this cohort, the mean age was 52.3 (Standard deviation [SD], 20.3) years and the majority of patients (55.4%) were male and White (73.7%). Additionally, investigators noted most participants underwent endoscopy between the ages of 50 and 64 years (30.4%). Of these patients, 2337 were found to have evidence of mucosal damage on endoscopy while 7013 did not.

Among all patients included in the study, 2338 patients had mucosal damage, and 52 (2.2%) were later diagnosed with PD. Of the 8955 patients without mucosal damage, 48 (0.5%) were later diagnosed with PD, indicating a notably increased likelihood of PD diagnosis among patients with mucosal damage compared with those without (2.2% vs 0.5%; P <.001; IRR, 4.15; 95% CI, 2.89-5.97; P <.001).

After adjusting for additional covariates including age at endoscopy, sex, race, Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index, constipation, dysphagia, and H pylori, the risk associated with mucosal damage remained pronounced (hazard ratio [HR], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11-2.51; P = .01). Further analysis revealed age (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P <.001), CCI (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.09-1.35; P <.001), constipation (HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.72‚Äì4.08; P <.001), and dysphagia (HR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.52-3.56; P <.001) as factors associated with an increased risk of developing PD.

Within the first nested subgroup of patients with mucosal damage, investigators did not note any significant demographic differences between patients with a clinical diagnosis PD and those without, although they pointed out patients with PD had a higher baseline prevalence of chronic NSAID use and GERD. Upon analysis, H pylori (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.84; 95% CI, 1.22-12.13; P = .02) and GERD (aOR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.04-14.76; P = .04) were associated with a markedly higher probability of developing PD.

Within the second nested subgroup of patients without mucosal damage, investigators again noted no significant demographic differences between patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD and those without, although patients with PD had a higher baseline prevalence of GERD. Chronic NSAID use, chronic smoking, GERD, PPI use, and H pylori were incorporated into this analysis, but investigators noted none of these covariates were associated with an increased risk of developing PD.

Investigators acknowledged multiple limitations to these findings, including the inability to capture cases of PD diagnosed and treated outside the MGB system; differences in baseline age distribution and mean CCI between patients with MD compared with those without; reliance on ICD codes for multiple exposures and outcomes; small sample sizes in the nested case-control analyses; and the risk of bias from unknown confounding.

‚ÄúThese findings highlight the necessity for heightened monitoring of patients with MD given their increased clinical PD susceptibility and the importance of establishing gut biomarkers,‚Äù investigators concluded. ‚ÄúWith PUD globally affecting upwards of 8.09 million people and H pylori infection even more widespread, timely detection and treatment of H pylori infection, along with MD management, may prove crucial to early recognition of risk of and potentially intervention against PD.‚Äù

Key takeaways:
--------------

* Researchers confirmed three early exit site signs and symptoms of catheter infection: pain, hyperemia/redness and abscess.
* The scale had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 88.3%.

A clinical scale was validated for early detection of infections at the exit site of central venous catheters for hemodialysis in patients with kidney disease, according to a study.

Treating chronic kidney disease may often involve hemodialysis, **Jos√© Luis Cobo-S√°nchez,** **PhD, MSc, MBA, RN,** of the Hospital Universitario Marqu√©s de Valdecilla-IDIVAL in Santander, Spain, and colleagues wrote in study background.

‚ÄúIn this context, the type of vascular access employed is closely related to patient morbidity and mortality. Thus, a patient receiving central venous catheters for hemodialysis (CVC-HD) vs. a fistula (whether autologous or prosthetic) is at four times greater risk for experiencing an infectious complication, and this risk is multiplied tenfold when the sole vascular access is a CVC-HD.‚Äù

Researchers ran a multicenter prospective cohort study of data on 337 central venous catheters for hemodialysis from 310 adults receiving treatment across nine hospitals in Spain. Patients included in the EXIT site Assessment study had a tunneled central venous catheter for hemodialysis for at least 1 month after insertion.

The study produced 515 total cultures, of which 117 were infected and 398 were not.

The scale consisted of five signs and symptoms at the exit site: pain during the interdialytic period; hyperemia or erythema of at least 2 cm; inflammation, induration or swelling; fever of at least 38¬∞C; 100.4¬∞F not attributable to other causes; and abscess or purulent exudate.

Nurses assessed exit sites using the scale. If any relevant symptoms were present, they collected a skin swab culture from around the catheter to confirm the presence of infection.

Researchers confirmed three exit site signs and symptoms in the final version of the scale: pain between dialysis sessions; hyperemia or redness of at least 2 cm; and abscess or purulent exudate. The scale had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 88.3%, with a sensitivity of 80.34% and a specificity of 95.23%.

Cobo-S√°nchez and colleagues found the scale had positive predictive properties, detecting around 90% of exit-site infections with acceptable validity parameters.

‚ÄúThe use of this scale facilitates the early detection and treatment of exit site infection, before its microbiological confirmation,‚Äù the researchers wrote. ‚ÄúFurthermore, its use would improve observational objectivity by ensuring uniformity of classification, thus facilitating the comparison of results, the continuity of care, cost savings, patient education, and the comparison of research studies on measures for prevention and/or treatment.‚Äù

Company also provides updates on its Phase 2 RECONNOITER Study in Raynaud's Phenomenon and Systemic Sclerosis and other corporate activities

BOSTON, Sept. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Aisa Pharma, Inc. a private, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to AISA-021(cilnidipine), a fourth-generation calcium channel antagonist. Aisa is developing AISA-021 for the treatment of Systemic Sclerosis (SSc), a rare disease, which impacts approximately 175,000 Americans and has the highest mortality rate of any autoimmune disease.

""To our knowledge, this is the first time the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to a calcium channel antagonist for an autoimmune illness,"" said Andrew Sternlicht, MD, CEO and Founder of Aisa Pharma. ""We hope this designation will accelerate our development program for AISA-021, which is designed to provide a once-daily, well-tolerated, and economical treatment that we hope can improve the lives of patients with SSc. We are actively seeking a development partner and investors to support bringing this much-needed treatment to patients.""

Under the FDA's Orphan Drug Act, orphan drug status provides incentives, including tax credits, grants and waiver of certain administrative fees for clinical trials, and seven years of market exclusivity following drug approval. To be granted the orphan drug designation, FDA concludes that it is medically plausible that the treatment may improve the disease.

Aisa submitted information from the ongoing Phase 2 study demonstrating improvement on several endpoints versus placebo, including SSc symptoms of overall disease severity, disease-related pain, gastrointestinal dysfunction, skin ulcers, disability, and breathing symptoms, as well as Raynaud's symptoms. In a preliminary review by an independent data safety committee, the ongoing study of 60 patients demonstrated a much lower incidence and severity of side effects as well as improved efficacy for preventing Raynaud's attacks, when compared to published reviews of current therapies.

Aisa also provided the following corporate updates:

* A Pre-IND meeting with the FDA for AISA-021 in the treatment of Systemic Sclerosis and Secondary Raynaud's Phenomenon is scheduled for September 2024.  
* The initial drug screening performed by the NIH as part of the Preclinical Pain Screening Platform to evaluate the suitability of AISA-021 as a non-opioid analgesic, demonstrated no abuse liability or addictive potential for the drug. Additional results are pending.  
* Two abstracts on AISA-021 will be presented at the ACR Convergence Scientific Meeting in Washington DC on 11/16/2024:

_AISA 021, a Novel Calcium Channel Antagonist in Development for Raynaud's & Systemic Sclerosis, Has Activity at Sodium Channel Targets for Pain Relief and Treats Scleroderma Pain Better Than Current Calcium Channel Blockers in a Phase 2A Study_

_Preliminary Results from the RECONNOITER Trial, a Phase 2 Study of AISA 021 in the Treatment of Secondary Raynaud's, Primarily Due to Systemic Sclerosis_

**About AISA-021:** AISA-021 is a form of cilnidipine, a fourth-generation calcium channel blocker (CCB), distinguished from other dihydropyridine CCBs by its increased selectivity for the N-type calcium channel. Cilnidipine is approved in certain Asian countries and widely used to treat hypertension there, but was never approved in the US, Canada, EU and UK. Cilnidipine causes vasodilation and further improves function in the heart, kidney and vasculature. In robust studies of hypertension treatment, cilnidipine is better tolerated with a wider therapeutic window than other approved CCBs, which are used off-label for Raynaud's. Unlike other approved CCBs, AISA-021 may also have a role in treating pain.

**About Systemic Sclerosis and Raynaud's Phenomenon in Systemic Sclerosis:** Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is the most fatal of autoimmune illnesses and affects approximately 175,000 patients in the United States. Approximately half of patients die of the disease within 12 years from initial diagnosis and 95% of SSc patients experience Raynaud's symptoms, which they describe as their most debilitating symptom. Raynaud's Phenomenon is characterized by decreased blood flow which can cause severe pain and tingling in the hands and fingers. Cardiac, renal and vascular disease, which have been shown to improve in patients treated for hypertension, contribute to morbidity and mortality in patients with SSc. No drug has been approved anywhere in the world for the treatment of Raynaud's.

Pooled results from the BOREAS and NOTUS studies show meaningful clinical benefit with 31% reduction in exacerbations along with lung function improvement  
Data from these two phase 3 studies supported Dupixent as the first-ever biologic approved for certain patients with uncontrolled COPD in the EU

Paris, September 10, 2024. A pooled analysis from the BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies showed that Dupixent reduced exacerbations and improved lung function compared to placebo in adults with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e., raised blood eosinophils). The results were presented today, in collaboration with Regeneron, for the first time at the 2024 European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress.

The European Medicines Agency was the first regulatory authority in the world to approve Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled COPD characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Specifically, the approval covers patients already on a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), or on a combination of a LABA and a LAMA if ICS is not appropriate. Dupixent has also been approved by ANVISA (the Brazilian health regulatory agency) and the Russian Ministry of Health for certain adults with uncontrolled COPD associated with type 2 inflammation. Regulatory submissions are under review with other authorities around the world, including in the US, China, and Japan.

Surya Bhatt, M.D., MSPH  
Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, US, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, and a co-principal investigator of the study  
‚ÄúFor far too long, I have watched patients with uncontrolled COPD struggle with a relentless cycle of exacerbations that diminish lung function, with no new treatment approaches to help alleviate this downward spiral. The pooled analysis of the pivotal BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies provide more comprehensive examination of the unprecedented efficacy and safety data, which reinforce the benefit of dupilumab for patients on maximal inhaled therapy and limited additional options.‚Äù

As presented, this pooled analysis reinforces previous positive results from the BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies. All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (with nearly all on triple therapy). Dupixent patients (n=938) achieved the following compared to placebo (n=936):

* 31% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (nominal p<0.0001).  
* Improvement in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV1) from baseline by 147 mL compared to 64 mL at 12 weeks (nominal p<0.0001). These improvements were observed as early as two weeks and sustained at 52 weeks (nominal p<0.0001).

Safety results in this pooled analysis were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 72% for Dupixent and 71% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent than placebo included nasopharyngitis (7.8% Dupixent, 7.4% placebo) and headache (7.8% Dupixent, 6.6% placebo). AEs leading to deaths were 2% for Dupixent and 1.6% for placebo.

The potential use of Dupixent and its safety and efficacy in COPD have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authorities outside of the EU, Brazil, and Russia.

About COPD  
COPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough, excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities, which may lead to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD, but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. Prior to the approval of Dupixent in the EU, there had been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade.

About the Dupixent COPD phase 3 study program  
BOREAS and NOTUS were replicate, randomized, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation, as measured by blood eosinophils ‚â•300 cells per ¬µL. The trials enrolled 1,874 patients who were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS.

During the 52-week treatment period, patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of ICS, LABA and LAMA. Double maintenance therapy, which included LABA and LAMA, was allowed if ICS was not appropriate.

The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks, change from baseline at 52 weeks in St. George‚Äôs Respiratory Questionnaire total score compared to placebo, change from baseline at 52 weeks in Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD total score compared to placebo, and safety.

The p-values for the pooled analysis were nominal because there was no hierarchical testing procedure for the pooled data.

About Sanofi and Regeneron‚Äôs COPD clinical research program  
Sanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics, Dupixent and itepekimab.

Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL33), an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.

Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation in two phase 3 studies, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

About Dupixent  
Dupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies, establishing that IL4 and IL13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.

Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and COPD in different age populations. More than 900,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.

Dupilumab development program  
Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.

In addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies, including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Clinical Summary

Migraine: When Triptans Don't Work
==================================

Susan London

TOPLINE:
--------

The majority of adults with migraine seen on a headache service do not benefit from triptans because of lack of effectiveness or side effects, requiring alternate medication strategies.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   Investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study of 419 adults with migraine (with or without aura) seen in a London-based tertiary headache service during a 2-year period.
*   The main outcome was triptan non-response according to the definition proposed by the European Headache Federation.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Overall, 63.8% of the patients had non-response to triptans, defined as failure of ‚â• 1 drug in this class due to lack of effectiveness and/or intolerability.
*   The odds of non-response increased with the number of preventive medications that had failed (odds ratio, 1.13; P < .001) and were higher for patients receiving calcitonin gene‚Äìrelated peptide monoclonal antibodies (1.64; P = .022); odds decreased with age (0.98; P < .001) and were lower for medication over-users (0.43; P = .006).
*   Although patients most commonly used oral sumatriptan, only about one-quarter (24.9%) had a response to this drug.
*   The triptan having the highest response rate was eletriptan (49.5% of patients), followed by nasal zolmitriptan (44.4%) and rizatriptan (35.7%).

IN PRACTICE:
------------

""Our findings highlight an alarming prevalence of triptan non-response among adult migraineurs receiving treatment in a London-based tertiary headache service,"" the authors wrote. ""It is imperative for clinicians to explore methods to optimize acute medication efficacy, whether this comprises changing to a triptan with a superior response rate, advocating for early intervention or considering alternative acute medication classes, such as gepants or ditans,"" they added.

SOURCE:
-------

The study was led by Robyn-Jenia Wilcha, MBChB Medicine (Hons), King's College London, London, UK, and was published online in Cephalalgia.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Limitations included study of a population more severely affected by migraine, exclusion of certain groups (those with additional headache disorders or psychiatric illness, and pregnant women), possible misclassification and confounding, and potential recall bias among clinicians providing study data.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

The study was funded in part by the National Institute for Health and Care Research Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.

Dr. Victoria Eugenia Galvis highlights key strategies for healthcare professionals:

- RECOGNIZE THE TRIGGERS: Factors like uncertainty, fear, and perceived threats can escalate patient emotions. Understanding these can help clinicians respond more effectively.
- DE-ESCALATION TECHNIQUES: Prioritize safety, remain calm, and use compassionate language. Active listening can help patients feel heard and validated, reducing tension.
- IDENTIFY UNDERLYING CAUSES: Emotional dysregulation may stem from conditions like PTSD or neurodevelopmental differences. A thorough assessment can guide appropriate interventions.

Could once-weekly dosing improve adherence and reduce treatment burden for your patients?","**Dr Victoria Eugenia Galvis Explores Approaches to Consultations With Patients Experiencing Emotional Dysregulation, Advocating Methods That Promote Resolution and Understanding**

Difficult interpersonal interactions between patients and healthcare professionals are common in all healthcare settings. Indeed, a 2022 YouGov poll found that 67% of patient-facing NHS workers experience aggression from a patient at least once a year.1 These interactions are seen by many as part of the emotional toll of patient care, contributing to both burnout in the profession and the breakdown of relationships with patients.

At a personal level, difficult consultations with emotionally dysregulated patients can make me feel drained and baffled, even though I have had training in conflict resolution and consider it part of my skillset. It is easy for these situations to escalate, and it seems like nobody wins when this happens: neither the staff who are trying to help, nor the patients who are trying to convey a message of frustration.

This article discusses how to approach situations in which a patient is agitated or aggressive in a way that de-escalates the situation and facilitates more effective communication and a better rapport between clinicians and patients. Emphasis is also given to stress-response mechanisms and the possible underlying causes of such behaviours; in many cases, aggression will be a clinical sign of a developmental or acquired difference‚Äîsuch as autism, adverse childhood experiences, or post-traumatic stress disorder‚Äîor another condition that can lead to emotional dysregulation.2,3 The article also discusses ways in which clinicians can look after themselves after such interactions, and reduce the associated emotional burden.

However, it is important to clarify that this article concerns rudeness and frustrated communication, not violence or abuse. Violence and abuse are never acceptable, and I agree with a zero-tolerance policy in the NHS as for any other work environment. Unfortunately, violence in the workplace does still happen despite these policies, and as many as 30% of patient-facing NHS workers experience violence from patients at least once a year.1

Factors Underlying Difficult Patient Interactions
-------------------------------------------------

In general, patient interactions become difficult because patients experience a number of stressful factors in healthcare settings, including:2,4,5

*   uncertainty
*   fear
*   perceived or real threat to life or health
*   frustration and confusion due to complicated processes in obtaining care
*   feelings of a lack of control, which may be severe for susceptible individuals.

Stressors like these can trigger a stress response in certain individuals‚Äîboth patients and doctors‚Äîthat may be stronger than those resulting from usual day-to-day interactions. The individual therefore experiences a ‚Äòfight-or-flight‚Äô response (also known as an acute stress response), in which their verbal communication can become impaired and their emotions more difficult to regulate voluntarily.6,7 Thus, even seemingly small amounts of external stress can have a tremendous impact on how a patient interacts with members of clinical staff.4,5

### The Maladapted Stress Response (Emotional Dysregulation)

Not everyone‚Äôs fight-or-flight response is the same. Just as with thresholds for heat or pain, the threshold for triggering an acute stress response varies between individuals, as does the nature of that response (such as in its duration, intensity, or how easily the person can consciously modulate it).6 This stress response‚Äîbroadly consisting of a faster response mediated by the sympathetic‚Äìadrenal‚Äìmedullary system and a slower response mediated by the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis7‚Äîis necessary for survival in both humans and animals, allowing them to have quicker reaction times, defend from threats, and escape dangerous situations.8,9 The faster, fight-or-flight response is characterised by increased heart rate, heightened senses, a surge of adrenaline and cortisol, creating a boost in energy levels that is normal in appropriate situations.9,10

Issues arise when people develop an inappropriate stress response: they may misinterpret nonthreatening situations as dangerous, be in a constant state of stress response that becomes chronic, or experience a response that is above the threshold that they can tolerate and become repeatedly overwhelmed.8,9 This inappropriate stress response to triggers is often called ‚Äòemotional dysregulation‚Äô, defined by the American Psychological Association as an ‚Äò_extreme or inappropriate emotional response to a situation_‚Äô;11 it is characteristic of people who have difficulties in understanding and influencing their own emotions.12 This emotional response can often be unpleasant for a person, and may have a negative impact on their relationships.12

#### _Toxic Stress_¬†

One factor that often leads to a maladapted stress response is ‚Äòtoxic stress‚Äô: frequent, chronic stress that has harmful and potentially lasting effects on physical and mental health, such as that caused by abuse or extreme poverty, but that can also arise from internal factors (such as pain or a heightened sensitivity to external stimuli).13 People experiencing toxic stress may have such a dysfunctional fight-or-flight response that they are unable to return to a calm physiological or psychological state and, in the long term, toxic stress can disrupt the neuro-endocrine-immune response, leading to adverse effects such as maladaptive coping skills, poor stress management, unhealthy lifestyles, mental illness, and physical disease.13

### Possible Clinical Causes¬†

In many cases, agitated or aggressive behaviour in the clinic will be a clinical sign of a condition or experience that impairs the patient‚Äôs executive or cognitive function.3,4,14 The possible clinical causes of a dysfunctional stress response can be physical, neurodevelopmental, environmental, or psychological (see Box 1).2,3,7,15‚Äì24 Clinicians should maintain a low threshold of suspicion for these causes in patients who are easily agitated.3,14

Approaching Difficult Patient Interactions¬†
-------------------------------------------

Assuming that there is no threat of violence, a clinician‚Äôs approach to a consultation with a patient who is being aggressive will have three broad aims: de-escalating the interaction by helping the patient to regulate their emotions; determining the clinical need; and preventing future difficult interactions by helping the patient to deal with their emotional dysregulation.2,4,5,14 In my opinion, two changes in focus are key for facilitating an effective approach of this kind:

*   changing the narrative from one of the ‚Äòvolatile patient‚Äô to one of emotional dysregulation and a heightened stress response
*   understanding that behavioural and communication difficulties are an indication that the situation needs to be addressed differently, and using the person‚Äôs behaviour to give clues on how to de-escalate the situation and prevent it recurring in future.

### Confirming and Ruling Out Physical Causes

When confronted by a patient who is behaving aggressively, clinicians should consider potential physical causes of their emotional dysregulation (see Box 1),2,3,14 and carry out relevant history taking, examinations, and investigations. Some possible causes include hormonal issues, pain (such as that caused by inflammatory bowel disease, fibromyalgia, or sciatica), and insomnia.2,3,14 If one of these diagnoses is established, the clinician should be able to set out a comprehensive but realistic treatment plan to achieve a reduction in the patient‚Äôs discomfort before also exploring other possible psychological triggers.3,5,14 Regardless of whether it is possible to fully resolve the physical issue with the treatments available, clinicians should provide validation of and compassion for the patient‚Äôs difficulties in a genuine manner.

In my experience, once a clinician has identified any other factors that may be affecting the person‚Äôs mood, they can more effectively suggest some basic strategies for emotional regulation to the patient. The fact that a patient has reached their adult years‚Äîand may even be an older adult‚Äîdoes not mean that they have naturally mastered emotional regulation or social communication.

### Recognising Different Stress Responses¬†

Clinicians should also understand that emotional dysregulation can take different forms, as this will help them to identify when a patient is experiencing emotional dysregulation and use their findings to inform any coping strategies and therapeutic interventions that the patient may need. The fight-or-flight response is not universal, and the modern understanding of stress responses is growing to include several other types that reflect a broader range of reactions to threat and stress (see Box 2).25‚Äì27

### The Consultation: De-escalating and Understanding

When confronted with a patient who is behaving aggressively, clinicians should perform the following essential actions:3‚Äì5,14,28,29

*   make their own safety and that of their team the first priority‚Äîif any team member is not safe, do not approach the situation
*   remain calm and use compassionate language, active listening techniques, and validation to explore the person‚Äôs grievances, while establishing healthy boundaries
    *   in appropriate situations, use neurodivergence-friendly and trauma-infomed approaches (see _Adapting to Neurodivergence and Trauma_)
*   start with the mindset that the patient's feelings are important and valid, even if team members don‚Äôt share the same point of view
*   be patient‚Äîit may take a minute or more of active listening time before the issue starts to make sense
*   if the clinician really can't achieve this understanding for any reason, it may be better to get another team member to address the situation, if possible.

Clinicians should listen and ask for clarification until they understand the situation, avoiding the urge to jump in with suggestions.4,5 It may help to give positive reinforcement if the patient is able to verbalise their concerns, even if they do it in an agitated or haphazard way.4,5 This could be by thanking the patient for raising the issue, or by offering an empathetic comment. Before giving an opinion, it may also be useful to ask the patient (in a noncondescending manner) for their opinion on what form they would prefer the clinician‚Äôs help to take. This allows the patient to feel understood and that they have some control of the situation.

If de-escalation cannot be achieved and the patient continues to behave aggressively, end the interaction (if necessary, following the practice‚Äôs safety procedures).4,14 Once the clinician is safe, they should ensure that other team members are safe, and get help as needed‚Äîfor example, by calling an ambulance or contacting an acute mental health team or the police. In addition, healthcare practitioners should consider whether the patient and their family are safe: if they behaved this way in a healthcare setting, are vulnerable household members at risk? If the patient stormed out of the practice, is there any risk of self-harm or suicide? It may be appropriate to arrange a follow-up welfare check by a neutral member of staff or the police.

Clinicians who can learn to keep their own stress response low and remain calm and compassionate despite having an animated patient in front of them will be more able to create a space for external regulation of the patient and discussion of their issue.2,5 This calmness can often be conveyed in a nonverbal manner, with a friendly tone of voice, a genuine smile, and warm behaviour directed towards the patient.2,3,5,14 Clinicians can let the patient feel heard by using their posture, as well as by avoiding full eye contact and adopting a nonthreatening stance.2‚Äì5,14

It may be appropriate to allow the patient to explore their issue by ‚Äòventing‚Äô their frustration for a while,4,5 although time constraints may mean that this process has to be cut short. In my experience, establishing a clear timeframe with the patient lets them know that the clinician has other responsibilities to attend to beyond the consultation. Once the patient has expressed their frustrations without judgement, the patient and doctor may then be able to move forward to more effective communication.

### Adapting to Neurodivergence and Trauma¬†

Some particularly difficult consultations to negotiate are those in which the patient has suffered severe trauma, is experiencing a toxic stress response, or has been hurt by a person in a position of trust (for example, survivors of domestic violence). These patients may be constantly scanning for threats or looking for any indication from the clinician that they may hurt them, so communication in these consultations needs to be especially calm, compassionate, and nonthreatening, and a trauma-informed approach may be especially beneficial.29,30 Some freely available resources on compassionate language and communication are provided in Box 3.

A greater understanding of neurodivergence may also help clinicians to interact with patients exhibiting certain aggressive or agitated behaviours more effectively, as neurodivergent people benefit from different approaches to communication and healthcare provision.18,28 For example, the common de-escalation advice to ‚Äòmaintain eye contact‚Äô may not be comfortable for autistic people, and they may respond negatively to this action.

Neurodivergent-friendly and trauma-informed approaches may therefore be a simple and effective way to improve and avoid some difficult consultations. These approaches differ from the more traditional, authoritative stance epitomised by Dr James Groves‚Äô widely cited 1978 article _Taking care of the hateful patient_,31 which has been criticised for presenting a pessimistic and divisive approach and belittling patients.32 In my opinion, such an approach may well establish boundaries, but is not conducive to a positive patient‚Äìdoctor relationship.

Sometimes, for neurodivergent individuals, social expectations such as maintaining a lower tone of voice to avoid interfering with other consultations may not be obvious, so clinicians should explain this calmly and set healthy boundaries, while respecting neurodivergent traits like nonlinear communication or fidgeting during talking.28 Also, clinicians should learn about other features of neurodivergence that could be misinterpreted as a negative interaction28‚Äîfor example, understanding that constant interruptions are not meant to be disrespectful, but are almost impossible for some individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder to control.

### What Guidance Is Available?

NICE‚Äôs 2015 guidance on this topic, _Violence and aggression: short-term management in mental health, health and community settings_, is aimed towards the management of patients with mental illness, but its recommendations are still useful for the management of patients with no known mental illness.33 The Medical Defence Union,4 the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland,5 and the NHS website34 also provide some useful information on how to deal with aggressive behaviour.

There is a lot of information freely available on this topic from other sources‚Äîincluding in conflict-resolution courses aimed at healthcare professionals and in resources produced for individual practices, primary care networks, and integrated care systems. Clinicians should be careful with some of these resources, however, as in my experience many of them are still heavily influenced by Groves‚Äô approach.

Further tips on handling aggressive behaviour is available in a [short video](https://youtu.be/4jUP4NctX8E?si=Mymu3jMLp4aorAgf).

How Difficult Interactions Impact Healthcare Professionals¬†
-----------------------------------------------------------

It is also important to recognise the real impact of these harder-than-average interactions on healthcare practitioners‚Äîin both the short and long term. If not addressed, repeated stressful interactions with patients can contribute to job dissatisfaction and burnout, affecting not only the healthcare professional, but also their private and professional networks.2,35

Burnout rates in healthcare are notably higher than in other professions in the UK, and various bodies‚Äîincluding the General Medical Council‚Äîhave reported that stress and burnout among doctors in the UK have reached unprecedented levels, exacerbated by long hours, high patient loads, and the emotional toll of patient care.36‚Äì38 The intensity and demands of healthcare roles contribute to this discrepancy significantly.

However, learning how to help patients to better regulate their emotions can actually give the healthcare professional a sense of achievement that extends beyond the consultation. In my experience, when dysregulated patients respond well to a clinician‚Äôs approach, both the patient and the clinician feel encouraged to share the strategies of regulation with colleagues, children, parents, friends, and partners, creating a beneficial ‚Äòripple effect‚Äô. Especially in general practice, where clinicians are not only treating single patients but whole family groups, the benefits of intervention for one patient can be reflected in other patients on the list.

After developing an understanding of emotional dysregulation in the healthcare setting, clinicians will hopefully also be able to extrapolate their learning and use this information in other day-to-day interactions, both in and out of the workplace.

### Safeguarding The Healthcare Professional‚Äôs Emotional State¬†

At certain moments, a clinician may not be in the best position to deal with a difficult consultation, such as when they are tired, hungry, frustrated, or burnt out. It is perfectly understandable that a clinician may need a break for self-care, either before a potentially difficult consultation or after one.

By investing in understanding one‚Äôs own mental state, clinicians can become more able to deal with the high-energy emotions that may flow in consultations with a patient experiencing emotional dysregulation.2,14 Box 4 details some books and podcasts that clinicians in particular situations may find useful.

Clinicians themselves may have experienced trauma as a result of childhood, work, or life experiences; thus, learning about and implementing trauma-informed healthcare approaches can help practitioners to avoid retraumatising themselves and subsequent mental ill health and burnout.

To avoid further trauma to patients and clinicians, there is a need for more trauma-informed approaches to healthcare in UK general practice. Organisations and colleagues should be supported in creating a culture of mutual compassion and understanding to allow better healthcare for all.

Why Consider Using a Different Approach?¬†
-----------------------------------------

### Improving Patient‚ÄìDoctor Relationships and Patient Outcomes¬†

The relationship between a patient and their healthcare provider is critical for effective diagnosis, treatment adherence, and overall patient satisfaction.39‚Äì41 A poor patient‚Äìdoctor relationship can significantly impact health outcomes, leading to several adverse effects.39,40 Box 5 lists some key ways in which a poor rapport can affect outcomes, emphasising the importance of good communication and positive relationships.39‚Äì45

Summary¬†
--------

Consultations with people exhibiting aggressive and agitated behaviour can be extremely taxing for clinicians, but they can also be rewarding when they end well. To get them right, clinicians must improve communication skills, foster empathy, and build trust within the patient‚Äìdoctor relationship, challenging noncompassionate techniques they might have learned or used in the past. Training healthcare providers in these areas and creating a supportive environment for patients to express their concerns can lead to better health outcomes and enhanced patient satisfaction.",gpt-4o-mini,T0jtveisiMgwqACdli4j

TOPLINE:
--------

Healthcare professionals' (HCPs) perspectives on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) might not fully align with patients' experiences, underscoring the need to incorporate adverse outcomes into clinical management, as well as routine quality-of-life assessments and mental health queries.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   Analysis of two studies in the Determinants, Incidence, and Consequences of Corticosteroid Excess study evaluating the impact and epidemiology of corticosteroid use in patients with IBD.
*   The study focuses on the impact database study (a retrospective analysis of spontaneous reporting systems and reported adverse events [AEs] associated with corticosteroid use in IBD patients) and the impact questionnaire study (single country analysis to define patient-reported corticosteroid exposure).
*   Report was aimed at characterising the safety of corticosteroid use in IBD patients, differences in AE burden between database and patient self-reports.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   The impact database study: 344,140 AEs were reported in FAERS (7870 related to prednisone/prednisolone and 2287 with budesonide use) and 42,836 reported in VigiBase (10,731 prednisone/prednisolone and 660 budesonide).
*   AEs increased significantly from 2008 to 2019 (P < .05) in both databases; those disproportionately associated with prednisone/prednisolone and budesonide vs other drugs included adrenal insufficiency, Cushingoid complications, osteonecrosis, osteoporosis, and pancreatitis.
*   Impact questionnaire: 4405 Crohn's and 4824 IBD patients returned questionnaires; overall, 69.7% (66.0% prednisolone and 13.7% budesonide) reported corticosteroid exposure and 31.7% reported receiving one prednisolone course longer than 12 weeks in duration.
*   Patients significantly more likely to report AEs were exposed to prednisolone vs budesonide (61.9% vs 27.4%), and most commonly, weight gain was affecting self-estimate (39.3% vs 13.0%, respectively). 

IN PRACTICE:
------------

""Results from both studies support limiting corticosteroid use to flare management and escalating other IBD treatments to reduce corticosteroid exposure,"" the authors wrote. ""Additional consideration should be given to young, female patients and those with a history of mental health disorders before prescribing corticosteroids,"" they added.
