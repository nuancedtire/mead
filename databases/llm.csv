- **Higher Dosage, Lower Risk:** Increasing thiazide dosages significantly reduces urine calcium levels, correlating with fewer symptomatic kidney stone events.
- **Study Background:** The recent analysis using the Medicare-Litholink Database involved 634 adults with kidney stones, highlighting the potential of thiazide diuretics in prevention strategies.
- **Dosage Efficacy:** 
  - Low dose (e.g., Hydrochlorothiazide < 25 mg): 18.9% reduction in urine calcium.
  - Medium dose: 25.5% reduction.
  - High dose: 28.4% reduction.
- **Cumulative Incidence:** At 4 years, incidence of symptomatic stones was 28.8% (low dosage), 19.5% (medium), and 18.0% (high).
- **Clinical Recommendation:** Start with a low dosage in patients with hypercalciuria, and then titrate based on effectiveness and side effect profiles.

Boosting Thiazide Dosage Can Reduce Kidney Stone Risk
=====================================================

**TOPLINE:**
------------

Higher thiazide doses are linked to greater reductions in urine calcium levels, which correlate with fewer symptomatic kidney stone events. This association suggests that adjusting thiazide dosage could be crucial in kidney stone prevention.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   The efficacy of using thiazides for kidney stone prevention was called into question by [the NOSTONE trial](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2209275), which found no added benefit of hydrochlorothiazide over a placebo in preventing kidney stone recurrence in high-risk patients.
*   Using the Medicare-Litholink Database, researchers identified adult participants with kidney stones prescribed thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, or indapamide) within 6 months after initial 24-hour urine collection and who underwent follow-up urine collections between 30 and 180 days after their first thiazide prescription fill.
*   Thiazide dosages were classified as:
    *   Low (chlorthalidone, < 12.5 mg/d; indapamide, < 0.6125 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, < 25 mg/d)
    *   Medium (chlorthalidone, 12.5 to < 25 mg/d; indapamide, 0.6125 to < 1.25 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, 25 to < 50 mg/d)
    *   High (chlorthalidone, ≥ 25 mg/d; indapamide, ≥ 1.25 mg/d; hydrochlorothiazide, ≥ 50 mg/d)
*   Changes in calcium levels in response to low, medium, and high thiazide dosages were evaluated. These changes were correlated with the incidence of symptomatic stone events, identified by emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or surgeries for stones within 6-48 months after the initial prescription fill.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   Researchers included 634 adults with kidney stones (mean age, 67.6 years; 46.5% women).
*   Higher thiazide doses were associated with greater reductions in urine calcium levels, with a low dose resulting in an 18.9% reduction, a medium dose in a 25.5% reduction, and a high dose in a 28.4% reduction (_P_ = .02).
*   At 4 years, the adjusted cumulative incidence of symptomatic stone events was 28.8%, 19.5%, and 18.0% for a low, an intermediate, and a high tercile of change in urine calcium levels, respectively, after thiazide prescription (_P_ = .04 for trend).

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

Considering the study's findings, experts from the University of California, San Francisco, and other institutions wrote in [an accompanying editorial](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.28927) that ""clinicians need to first identify patients with hypercalciuria and then aggressively treat them with thiazide diuretics to yield the most benefit in reducing kidney stone recurrence,"" adding, ""However, most clinicians likely prefer to start at low dosages and then titrate the dosage based on adverse effects and efficacy.""

**SOURCE:**
-----------

This study was led by Ryan S. Hsi, MD, Department of Urology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. It was published [online](https://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.28953&utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2024.28953) in _JAMA Network Open_.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

This study's limitations included the possibility of omitted variable bias and unmeasured differences between participants prescribed different dosages of thiazides. The sample consisted mostly of older adults, potentially limiting generalizability.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

This study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. The authors declared no conflicts of interests.

2024-09-03 07:01:00,2024-09-03 22:47:04,"🔍 **Key Insights on Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Dementia Risk**  
A recent study sheds light on the alarming connection between Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and dementia risk. Here are the takeaways:

- **Doubled Risk:** Individuals who experience AKI face a 50% increased risk of developing any form of dementia, with specific types like Lewy body dementia seeing increases as high as 88%.
- **Recurrence Matters:** Recurrent AKI episodes substantially elevate dementia risk, emphasizing the need for monitoring and intervention strategies.
- **Hospital-Acquired vs. Community-Acquired:** Dementia risk is 55% higher for hospital-acquired AKI vs. community cases, indicating the need for robust patient management during hospital stays.
- **Age Factor:** The risk is significantly accentuated in individuals over 85, suggesting targeted strategies for this demographic may be warranted.
- **Public Health Implications:** Identifying AKI patients as a high-risk group for dementia can influence prevention strategies and policies aimed at mitigating the upcoming dementia epidemic.

This compelling study highlights the importance of kidney health in cognitive decline prevention. For further details, check out the full article here: [News Medical](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20240829/Acute-kidney-injury-doubles-dementia-risk-study-finds.aspx)

_Study: [Acute Kidney Injury and Its Association With Dementia and Specific Dementia Types: Findings From a Population-Based Study in Sweden.](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209751) Image Credit: crystal light / Shutterstock.com_

A recent study published in the journal _[Neurology](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209751)_ examines the association between dementia risk and a prior history of acute kidney injury (AKI).

AKI and dementia
----------------

Dementia is a condition in which cognitive function declines progressively, thereby impacting the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). In 2019, about 55 million people were estimated to be affected by dementia.

Dementia is an incurable and progressive condition that requires active and comprehensive prevention strategies to reduce the public health burden and costs associated with its management. Several factors increase the risk of developing dementia, some of which include lower educational status, traumatic brain injury, midlife hypertension or obesity, diabetes, drinking, smoking, depression and social isolation, air pollution, and physical inactivity.

Like dementia, AKI increases the risk of adverse health outcomes, including death due to the development of heart and renal failure.

Preclinical studies indicate that AKI increases dementia risk. This association may involve multiple mechanisms, such as cerebrovascular pathology, autonomic dysfunction, abnormally low neurotransmitter levels, and neuroinflammation.

About the study
---------------

The current study involved 305,122 people 65 years and older in Stockholm, Sweden, who did not have a dementia diagnosis at baseline and had recorded kidney function measures. After a diagnosis of AKI, the study participants were monitored for any dementia.

Dementia occurrence was stratified by AKI history, the severity of AKI, AKI recurrence, and whether their kidney injury was community- or hospital-acquired.

What did the study show?
------------------------

The median participant age was 75 years, 57% of whom were women. During the follow-up period of 12 years, 79,888 cases of AKI and 47,938 cases of dementia were reported.

About 36% of the study cohort was diagnosed with hypertension, whereas 11% and 10% were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation, respectively. About 30% and 25% of the individuals were prescribed beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi and ARB), respectively. About 20% of the study cohort had stages three to five chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The mean age when AKI occurred was 77 years. Hypertension was the most common illness in the AKI subgroup, with a higher prevalence of 69% as compared to 36% in the entire study cohort.

The most frequently prescribed drugs reported in the AKI subgroup included ACEi, ARBs, or beta-blockers. Over 64% of individuals with AKI were also diagnosed with CKD.

Doubled risk of dementia after AKI
----------------------------------

A total of 37 cases of dementia for every 1,000 person-years (PY) was reported among people with a history of AKI. Comparatively, before the AKI incident, the dementia incidence was 17.3 for every 1,000 PY.

After compensating for other confounding factors, the occurrence of AKI was associated with a 50% increased risk of developing any type of dementia as compared to those without a history of AKI.

An increased risk of dementia was associated with Lewy bodies (DLB)/Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) by 88%, 47%, and 31%, respectively.

Severe AKI that required hospitalization rather than outpatient management was associated with an increased dementia risk. The risk was 45% higher after AKI stage one as compared to 61% higher following stages two and three.

Hospital-acquired and hospital-managed AKI was also associated with a 55% higher dementia risk as compared to 31% for community-acquired/community-managed AKI. This risk was similarly increased at 48% and 39% for patients with two and three recurrences of AKI, respectively.

The impact of AKI on different types of dementia
------------------------------------------------

The risk of DLB and PDD was 88% higher in individuals with a history of AKI as compared to an increased risk of 47% and 31% for vascular dementia and AD, respectively. In general, specific dementia types were more common with recurrent AKI and increased AKI severity.

The most common type of dementia was AD, with a total of 17,663 cases from 47,938 dementia diagnoses. Vascular dementia, DLB, PDD, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) accounted for 29.7%, 3.6%, and 1% of dementia cases, respectively.

Age-stratified analyses identified a four-fold increased risk of DLB and PDD among those older than 85 years.

Conclusions
-----------

> _This study identifies individuals with AKI as a population at high risk of dementia who may benefit from close monitoring for early detection and implementation of antidementia strategies_.”

The study findings confirm previous studies reporting a two-fold risk of dementia among people hospitalized with AKI while also extending these observations to a broader patient sample over a longer duration. The researchers also identified a dose-response relationship between dementia risk and AKI history, thus supporting a causal association between these two diseases.

2024-09-03 06:53:00,2024-09-03 22:47:11,"🔍 New insights into Type 2 diabetes management and voice pitch! Here are key findings from a recent study:

- **Link Confirmed**: A significant positive relationship exists between blood glucose levels and voice pitch in individuals with Type 2 diabetes.
- **Research Method**: 505 participants were monitored using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) while recording their voices multiple times a day for two weeks.
- **Findings**: As blood glucose levels rise, the fundamental frequency of the voice also increases, setting the stage for potential voice-based monitoring tools.
- **Future Implications**: The study suggests that voice analysis could lead to non-invasive glucose monitoring, simplifying diabetes management for millions.
- **Need for Further Research**: Encouragement for more studies to explore voice as a predictive tool for glucose levels.

As part of its ongoing exploration of vocal biomarkers and the role they can play in enhancing health outcomes, Klick Labs published a new study in _Scientific Reports_ today – confirming the link between blood glucose levels and voice pitch and opening the door to future advancements in non-invasive glucose monitoring for people [living with Type 2 diabetes](https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Type-2-Diabetes.aspx).

In ""_Linear Effects of Glucose Levels on Voice Fundamental Frequency in Type 2 diabetes and Individuals with Normoglycemia_,"" researchers investigated how blood glucose levels influence the frequency of the voice in 505 participants across three glycemic statuses – non-diabetic, prediabetic, and Type-2 diabetic. Participants were fitted with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and recorded their voices multiple times daily for two weeks. The analysis revealed a linear relationship where an increase in CGM glucose levels corresponded to an increase in the fundamental frequency in the voice.

> By establishing a significant positive association between glucose levels and fundamental frequency, our study provides compelling justification for more research on using voice to predict and monitor glucose levels. Whereas current glucose monitoring methods are often invasive and inconvenient, voice-based glucose monitoring could be as easy as talking into a smartphone, which could change the game for the estimated 463 million people around the world living with Type 2 diabetes.""
> 
> Jaycee Kaufman, lead author and scientist at Klick Labs

Klick Labs' latest research marks another step forward in its ongoing commitment to revolutionizing the detection and management of diabetes using voice tech and machine learning. Their October 2023 study in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health_ demonstrated that voice and AI can screen for Type 2 diabetes with high accuracy. Previously, their _""Screening for Impaired Glucose Homeostasis: A Novel Metric of Glycemic Control""_ research also appeared in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health_ (May 2023), and their _""Homeostasis as a proportional–integral control system""_ study was published in _Nature Digital Medicine_ (May 2020).
