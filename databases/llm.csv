Key takeaways:

* When a patient made a critical error in inhalation technique and/or had insufficient peak inspiratory flow, they had inhaler misuse.
* In the assessed study population, 82.3% used a minimum of one misused inhaler.

Inhaler misuse was high in hospitalized patients with COPD, with 69.4% of all inhalers at admission found to be misused, according to results published in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases: Journal of the COPD Foundation.

Ga—ël Grandmaison

‚ÄúAs a hospital physician, these findings prompt me to systematically evaluate the inhalers used by COPD patients, regardless of their reason for hospitalization,‚Äù Ga—ël Grandmaison, MD, assistant physician in internal medicine at University and Hospital of Fribourg in Switzerland, told Healio.

Data were derived from Grandmaison G, et al. Chronic Obstr Pulm Dis. 2024;doi:10.15326/jcopdf.2024.0505.

‚ÄúIn response to these findings, we have implemented a systematic and standardized assessment of inhaler use among our patients, aiming to correct inhalation techniques or replace the inhaler if necessary,‚Äù Grandmaison continued. ‚Äú[This intervention](https://smw.ch/index.php/smw/article/view/3394/5882) has significantly reduced the number of improperly used inhalers at hospital discharge.‚Äù

In a cross-sectional study, Grandmaison and colleagues evaluated 96 patients (mean age, 71.6 years; 63% men) in the internal medicine division of Fribourg Hospital with a diagnosis of COPD to find out how many patients in this population misuse inhalers via physiotherapist assessments and the In-Check Dial G16 (Alliance Tech Medical) over 9 months.

Researchers cited inhaler misuse when a patient made a critical error in inhalation technique and/or had insufficient peak inspiratory flow (PIF).

The total cohort had 160 inhalers, and nearly 70% (111 inhalers) had been misused. In the entire study population, 82.3% of patients used a minimum of one misused inhaler.

‚ÄúNumerous studies have highlighted the significant issue of improper inhaler use in outpatient settings,‚Äù Grandmaison said. ‚ÄúOur study confirms that this problem is also widespread.‚Äù

A critical error in inhalation technique was behind more instances of inhaler misuse than insufficient PIF (105 inhalers; 65.6% vs. 22 inhalers; 13.8%), and this was also reflected in the proportions of patients who used a minimum of one inhaler with a critical error (81.3%) and had insufficient PIF (21.9%).

In an effort to determine if targeted teaching can change the prevalence of inhaler misuse, researchers had physiotherapists carry out up to three teaching sessions and reassessed the number of inhalers with critical errors after each one.

With each additional session, fewer inhalers had been used with critical errors (one session, 33 inhalers; two sessions, 15 inhalers; three sessions, nine inhalers).

Five patients had cognitive disorders that inhibited them from reaching an adequate inhalation technique, according to researchers. A lack of coordination between inhaler activation and inspiration (n = 4) was another factor preventing adequate inhalation technique, followed by fine motor disorders and the inability to hold one‚Äôs breath sufficiently (each n = 2).

Researchers further assessed how many inhalers were unsuitable, meaning they ‚Äúcannot be used optimally, either because of an insufficient PIF or because of an inability to use an inhaler optimally despite specific teaching,‚Äù and found 27 (16.9%). Use of at least one unsuitable inhaler was noted in 25% of the study population.

‚ÄúSuboptimal inhaler use is associated with poor disease control, more frequent hospitalizations and increased costs,‚Äù Grandmaison told Healio. ‚ÄúThe prevalence of improperly-used inhalers is alarming, and strategies to address this issue are urgently needed.‚Äù

Among those hospitalized with a COPD exacerbation, 62.2% of the inhalers in this subgroup had been misused, whereas in the group of those hospitalized without an exacerbation, 85.7% of inhalers had been misused.

Additionally, those hospitalized for a respiratory compliant misused 65.9% of the inhalers in this subgroup, which was lower than the 82.4% of misused inhalers in the group not hospitalized for a respiratory compliant.

‚ÄúThese results underscore the critical importance of assessing inhalation technique and providing appropriate therapeutic education,‚Äù Grandmaison told Healio. ‚ÄúThey also highlight the need to evaluate a patient‚Äôs inspiratory capacity and ensure that the chosen inhaler matches their specific needs.‚Äù

With both this study and the study mentioned above on the intervention that lowered the number of improperly used inhalers at discharge completed, Grandmaison plans to continue researching the intervention.

‚ÄúThe next step is to evaluate the impact of such an intervention on symptom control and disease progression,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAdditionally, our goal is to adapt the strategy developed in our department for use in outpatient care.‚Äù

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","Groundbreaking lipid profiling uncovers how plant-based fats dramatically enhance heart and metabolic health, paving the way for precise dietary interventions.

A recent research briefing published in the journal _Nature Medicine_ reported associations between dietary fat quality and cardiometabolic risk.

The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks the evidence for the health benefits of substituting specific nutrients for others (e.g., mono- and poly-unsaturated fats for saturated fat) as low to moderate. According to the WHO, the current dietary guidelines advocating for reduced consumption of saturated fats are based on evidence of moderate certainty but remain a topic of ongoing debate.

Besides, the main drawbacks of existing intervention trials assessing different dietary fat types are shorter durations and reliance on indirect measures, e.g., cholesterol, instead of clinical endpoints (incident type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular events). Furthermore, observational studies evaluating the health outcomes of lower saturated fat intake are prone to confounding and often do not report the effects of specific nutrient substitutions.

The study and findings

In the present briefing, researchers utilized extensive blood fat composition profiling in different types of studies and observed associations between dietary fat quality and cardiometabolic risks. They combined data from dietary intervention studies that precisely controlled the types and sources of dietary fats with long-term observational studies that monitored disease occurrence over extended periods.

The researchers conducted extensive blood lipid profiling and developed/validated a multi-lipid score (MLS). The score reflected the effects of an intervention on the concentrations of 45 lipid metabolites, serving as a surrogate for metabolic adaptation to dietary fat changes. This approach allowed them to evaluate the implications of altering dietary fat quality on cardiometabolic health more precisely. The team leveraged the MLS to assess the implications of changes in the quality of dietary fats on cardiometabolic health in population studies.

Further, subgroup-specific effects were analyzed in a long-term intervention trial. The differences in MLS, which aligned with the impact of substituting saturated dairy fat with plant-based unsaturated fat, were associated with a significantly lower incidence of type 2 diabetes (in a dietary intervention trial) and cardiovascular disease (in prospective cohort studies).

Persons with initially worse MLS exhibited a stronger decrease in diabetes risk when on a Mediterranean diet rich in plant-based unsaturated fats than those with favorable MLS. This finding highlights the importance of the initial metabolic state in determining the effectiveness of dietary interventions. Substituting saturated fats from dairy products, e.g., butter, with plant-based unsaturated fats could result in substantially reduced cardiometabolic risks.

Conclusions

The study contributes important evidence supporting the current guidelines on the optimal source and quality of dietary fat but also underscores ongoing debates and limitations in the existing evidence base. The researchers addressed previous limitations of evidence underlying these guidelines by integrating randomized controlled trials and observational studies. The findings highlight the cardiometabolic benefits of replacing saturated fat from dairy products with unsaturated fat from plant products.

The authors said, ‚ÄúThe enthusiasm our work has generated encourages us to apply omics profiles for integrating data from cohorts and trials to other nutrition research questions.‚Äù However, they cautioned that their multi-study strategy is not without limitations.

While this multi-study approach addressed previous research biases, the team did not perform independent studies to establish thresholds for decision-making, examine cost-effectiveness, and validate absolute effect sizes on all metabolites. However, they cautioned that their multi-study strategy is not without limitations.

Additionally, the observed associations need validation in diverse racial and ethnic groups, as the study populations were primarily of European descent. Overall, the findings open avenues for more precise targeted interventions of dietary fat quality through lipid profiling. However, the application of lipidomics scores for dietary risk prevention requires further validation in future randomized controlled trials, particularly in more diverse populations.

===============================================================================

September 4, 2024

By Joshua Fitch, Senior Editor

Alan Percy, MD, discussed what the FDA approval of trofinetide (Daybue) has meant to patients with Rett syndrome aged 2 years and older.

Alan Percy, MD, Professor of Pediatrics, Neurology, Neurobiology, Genetics, and Psychology at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and the lead author for the LILAC-1 and LILAC-2 studies, recently discussed significant advancements in the treatment of Rett syndrome, highlighting the FDA approval of trofinetide (Daybue; Acadia Pharmaceuticals), approved on March 13, 2023. Percy also discussed the recent long-term safety data for trofinetide, based on a pair of open-label extension studies LILAC-1 and LILAC-2.

""Actually, it's quite interesting that while there is great enthusiasm among parents of children, the survival in Rett syndrome is quite long. So average survival is over age 50. So, many adult women with Rett syndrome are also taking this medication,"" Percy explained, noting the trofinetide approval marked a significant milestone in the direct management of Rett syndrome symptoms.

Percy emphasized the groundbreaking nature of this treatment, noting that ""this was the first product that was ever has been developed and approved by the FDA for direct treatment of the signs or symptoms of Rett syndrome. Other medications we use are for symptomatic care, but nothing has been available previously to direct at the basic underpinnings of Rett syndrome.""

The pivotal trial for this treatment, known as the LAVENDER trial, was a ""double-blind, placebo-controlled study lasting 12 weeks,"" Percy explained. The trial utilized the Rett Syndrome Behavioral Questionnaire (RSBQ) and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) as primary endpoints to measure the treatment's effectiveness. ""What is quite remarkable is at the end of the first pivotal trial, 12 weeks both the RSBQ and the CGI-I showed improvement.""

LILAC-1 was a 40-week, open-label extension of the LAVENDER trail and evaluated safety and efficacy of trofinetide in patients with Rett syndrome aged 5 to 21 years. LILAC-2 was a 32-month open-label extension evaluating trofinetide in females aged 5 to 22 years who had completed LILAC-1, according to Acadia Pharmaceuticals.

The most common side effects in the trials were diarrhea and vomiting.

Percy acknowledged that while the treatment shows significant promise, it is not without challenges. ""I think it is important to mention that diarrhea can be a substantial problem, and there may be individuals who have to stop the treatment simply because the diarrhea is not manageable."" However, he pointed out that strategies have been developed over time to manage this side effect more effectively. ""We start at 50% of the recommended weight-based dose, and we gradually increase to the point of maximum tolerability.""

Vaxcyte, Inc has announced positive topline results from its Phase 1/2 study of VAX-31, a 31-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) candidate. The study, which involved 1,015 adults aged 50 and older, found that VAX-31 was well tolerated and elicited strong opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) immune responses for all 31 serotypes evaluated. Notably, VAX-31 met or exceeded regulatory immunogenicity standards for all 31 serotypes at middle and high doses, showing significant improvements over Prevnar 20 (PCV20) for several serotypes.

‚ÄúWe are exceptionally proud to share these results, which we believe validate VAX-31‚Äôs potential as a best-in-class pneumococcal vaccine capable of raising the bar for immunogenicity standards,‚Äù said Jim Wassil, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Vaxcyte. ‚ÄúThe public health community continues to highlight the need for broader-protection vaccines to prevent IPD, which is associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and meningitis. To address this need, VAX-31 was designed to increase coverage to more than 95% of IPD circulating in adults 50 and older in the United States, with the potential to provide significantly greater coverage relative to today‚Äôs standard-of-care adult PCVs.‚Äù1

### Main Takeaways

1.  Vaxcyte‚Äôs VAX-31 vaccine showed strong immune responses and was well tolerated in a Phase 1/2 study of 1,015 adults aged 50 and older.
2.  VAX-31 met or exceeded immunogenicity standards for all 31 serotypes and demonstrated superior responses compared to Prevnar 20 for several serotypes.
3.  Vaxcyte plans to advance VAX-31 to a Phase 3 trial by mid-2025 and initiate a Phase 2 infant study to offer broader protection against pneumococcal disease.

The randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding study compared three dosage levels of VAX-31 to PCV20, assessing its safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity over six months. Results showed that VAX-31 at the high and middle doses met non-inferiority criteria for all 20 common serotypes with PCV20, and demonstrated statistically superior immune responses for several serotypes. The vaccine also met superiority criteria for 11 additional serotypes unique to VAX-31.

[Back in February](https://www.contagionlive.com/view/vaxcyte-completes-enrollment-for-its-phase-1-2-trial-for-innovative-pneumococcal-vaccine-vax-31), Vaxcyte completed enrollment for the Phase 1/2 trial of VAX-31, a 31-valent PCV designed to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding study, which involves 1,015 participants, is evaluating three dosage levels of VAX-31 compared to PCV20.

Streptococcus pneumoniae causes PD, leads to severe infections such as meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia. It results in around 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the US The World Health Organization and the CDC classify Streptococcus pneumoniae as a top antibiotic-resistant threat. It is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in children under five and causes over 50% of bacterial meningitis cases in the US The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains highlights the urgent need for a more effective vaccine.

Looking ahead, Vaxcyte plans to advance VAX-31 into a Phase 3 program, with a pivotal non-inferiority study set to begin by mid-2025. Additionally, a Phase 2 study of VAX-31 in infants is planned for early 2025. VAX-31 aims to provide broader protection against pneumococcal disease, potentially covering more than 95% of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) strains in adults. As a novel 31-valent PCV, it represents a significant advancement in pneumococcal vaccination, seeking to enhance coverage and efficacy beyond current standard vaccines.

[FDA Briefs|September 2024 Brief](https://www.targetedonc.com/fda-briefs/september-2024-brief)

The FDA has approved FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx as companion diagnostics to be used with olaparib, abiraterone, and prednisone or prednisolone BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Two prostate cancer cells in the final stage of cell division: ¬©PRB ARTS - stock.adobe.com

*   **The FDA has approved the FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx as companion diagnostics for the combination of olaparib (Lynparza) and abiraterone (Zytiga) with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with _BRCA_\-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).**
*   **This approval follows 2 previous approvals of the FoundationOne CDx as companion diagnostics for olaparib in mCRPC.**
*   **The availability of tissue- and liquid-based diagnostic tools provides greater access to genomic testing for patients.**

The FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx have been approved by the FDA for companion use with olaparib, abiraterone, and prednisone or prednisolone in patients with _BRCA_\-mutated mCRPC.1

‚ÄúThis approval reinforces the importance of testing for genomic mutations at metastatic diagnosis to help guide treatment decisions,‚Äù said Mia Levy, MD, PhD, chief medical officer at Foundation Medicine, in a press release. ‚ÄúOur high-quality tissue and liquid biopsy companion diagnostic tests will allow more patients to access genomic testing, regardless of specimen type, and will simplify complex decisions by generating the best information to enable better decision-making. There is a critical unmet need for first-line treatment options for patients with _BRCA_\-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and this combination therapy is an important advancement.‚Äù

This approval marks Foundation Medicine‚Äôs seventh FDA-approved companion diagnostic in prostate cancer. In May 2020, the FDA approved the FoundationOne CDx in patients with homologous recombination repair gene-mutated mCRPC who had progressed following treatment with enzalutamide (Xtandi) or abiraterone.2 In November 2020, the [**Liquid CDx was approved as a companion diagnostic**](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/foundationone-liquid-cdx-receives-expanded-fda-indication-in-metastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer) for olaparib to identify patients with mCRPC harboring _BRCA1, BRCA2_, or _ATM_ alterations.3

The FoundationOne companion diagnostics can analyze over 300 cancer-related genes using either blood or tissue samples. The approval of both tissue- and blood-based diagnostic tools provides greater access and flexibility for patients to benefit from genomic testing, particularly with the poor prognosis associated with _BRCA_\-mutated mCRPC.1

‚ÄúThis is an important milestone for men with aggressive prostate cancer,‚Äù said Courtney Bugler, president and chief executive officer of ZERO Prostate Cancer, in the press release. ‚ÄúBiomarker testing is an important tool for patients and families to help facilitate personalized treatment decision making, and we applaud Foundation Medicine for these additional companion diagnostic indications.‚Äù

==========================================================================

With 1k new patients a month, the company has almost quadrupled its revenue in one year
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UK-based healthtech Doccla has secured a ¬£35m Series B, led by European VC Lakestar, with new investors French VC Elaia and existing investors General Catalyst, Speedinvest and the investment leg of German media company Bertelsmann also participating.

Having almost quadrupled its annual revenue in 2023, it's planning its expansion in DACH and France, and says its German and French investors will help its international growth plans.

The startup, founded in 2019, makes ‚Äúvirtual ward‚Äù technology for healthcare providers. It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.

Doccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland‚Äôs Health Service Executive (HSE).

Doccla‚Äôs founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.

‚ÄúWith the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it‚Äôs a huge opportunity to scale,‚Äù says Ratz.

#### The virtual A&E

Sweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.

According to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.

Patients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.

So far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it‚Äôs adding 1k new patients every month.

‚ÄúOver time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,‚Äù Ratz says.

#### Partnering with pharma

Doccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).

‚ÄúWe have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,‚Äù Ratz says. ‚ÄúThis is because we are in very close contact with our patients.‚Äù

Doccla says it‚Äôs interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he‚Äôs seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.

With 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.

In one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.

‚ÄúWe can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits ‚Äî in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,‚Äù Ratz says.

Doccla has raised a total of ¬£52m to date.

In October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.",gpt-4o-mini

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","Berlin-based Caresyntax, which is building an AI-driven data platform for surgery, has raised a $180m Series C extension.

The round is made up of $80m in equity and $100m in debt ‚Äî and is tied to specific milestones. The fresh funding tops up the startup‚Äôs $130m Series C, raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.

It‚Äôs the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.

Caresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.

### AI for hospitals

Caresyntax says it wants to build the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals‚Äô surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.

The company‚Äôs platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.

While some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax‚Äôs platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.

‚ÄúEffectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,‚Äù they add.

If it does what it sets out to do, it‚Äôs a big opportunity.

Costs associated with operations account for 30% of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends 11% of GDP on health.

Founded in 2013 in Germany ‚Äî Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 ‚Äî its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company‚Äôs revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.

### The rise of smart surgery

The round comes on the back of a strong 18 months for startups developing tech for the operating theatre.

Since the start of 2023, three of the four biggest medtech raises have all gone to startups building robots to help surgeons. The UK‚Äôs CMR Surgical picked up ¬£165m in September last year, Switzerland‚Äôs DistalMotion $150m in April 2023 and Italy‚Äôs Medical Microinstruments $110m in February this year.

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","The meteoric rise of a new class of weight loss drugs over the past two years, known as GLP-1s, has seen a new name take the title of Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, helped a country dodge a recession and hit grocery sales in the US.

The valuations of the companies that make this so-called ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù class of drugs ‚Äî which includes Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and US rival Eli Lilly (maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) ‚Äî have soared as investors bet big on a medication projected by some to hit $150bn in sales by the early 2030s.

The potential of the market has not been lost on founders.

It‚Äôs a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù opportunity, says Kai Eberhardt, the founder and CEO of Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform which operates in the UK, France and Germany, alongside its home market. It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.

‚ÄúFor us [GLP-1 drugs] are already a strong growth driver,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.‚Äù

While treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva‚Äôs overall business ‚Äî Eberhardt says it‚Äôs growing total patient and revenue numbers by ‚Äúdouble digit‚Äù percentage points year-on-year ‚Äî the meds could become the startup‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest‚Äù growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.

### Riding the wave

Oviva‚Äôs not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity ‚Äî many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.

In the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart‚Äôs CEO, food sales have fallen as the one in eight adults in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, propping up Denmark‚Äôs GDP in the process.

All of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have convinced them to get out their chequebook: Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a ‚Ç¨10m Series A in August 2023 a year on from a ‚Ç¨3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised ‚Ç¨3.1m last summer.

Many startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn‚Äôt start life offering them ‚Äî largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.

UK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs health‚Äù brand, but has recently changed that. The company‚Äôs website uses images of men and women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.

Yazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.

Meurling tells Sifted it had hit ‚Ç¨14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It‚Äôs now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.

Other startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men‚Äôs sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.

‚Äú[GLP-1 meds] are a game changer,‚Äù says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be ‚Äústrange‚Äù if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn‚Äôt looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.

While GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the ‚Äúhype‚Äù surrounding the drug class has ‚Äúopened doors‚Äù for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler ‚Äî adding that the startup managed to raise its ‚Ç¨400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It‚Äôs now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it‚Äôll look to target US employers ‚Äî who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.

### Kinks in the supply chain

There are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector ‚Äî not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.

Some of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate‚Äôs $100m in 2021 and Form Health‚Äôs $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than ‚Ç¨10m in a single round.

Investors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics ‚Äî Manual was still selling past the deadline.

If a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.

‚ÄúAs there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.‚Äù

### Who‚Äôll stump up the cash?

There‚Äôs also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.

While Numan‚Äôs head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the ‚Äúsuccess of private sector companies offering GLP-1 [drugs] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS‚Äù, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won‚Äôt be enough to hit real scale.

‚ÄúUS investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts [selling to whole organisations like health insurers],‚Äù says Syhler. ‚ÄúThis means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care ‚Äî where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.‚Äù

In Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.

In the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.

Oviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS ‚Äî but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it‚Äôs in ‚Äúmature dialogues with several health systems‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,‚Äù says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that don‚Äôt always want to work with startups. Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.

Whether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen ‚Äî but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. ‚ÄúI've never been an investor in a company that‚Äôs got so much attention ‚Äî in a space that‚Äôs got so much attention,‚Äù says Arnardottir.",gpt-4o-mini

On Wednesday UK-based period tracking app Flo Health announced it had raised $200m ‚Äî pushing its valuation beyond $1bn and making it Europe‚Äôs first femtech unicorn.

It turned out to be a very buzzy story: as people were quick to point out online, Flo also became Europe‚Äôs first women‚Äôs health unicorn with an all-male founding team ‚Äî a detail which sparked a backlash online.

‚ÄúA company founded by men, led by men and funded by men became the first WOMEN'S health app to achieve unicorn status. If this doesn't show you everything that's wrong with the ecosystem, I don't know what will,‚Äù Anna-Sophie Hartvigsen, cofounder of investment learning app and community for women Female Invest, wrote in a viral LinkedIn post, citing stats on the lack of funding for female founders. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad that a femtech company is doing well,‚Äù she later added in the comments. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs bad that only men are able to succeed in this space.‚Äù

Some founders in the comments underneath Hartvigsen's post said that they‚Äôve struggled with fundraising as a woman; there was also a debate in a private WhatsApp group seen by Sifted about whether female founders should add a token male founder to their team in an effort to increase their chances of getting cheques. Someone in that group added that we won‚Äôt fix the trend of men funding men until there are more female investors.

But others didn‚Äôt see it that way.

‚ÄúThis achievement should actually be celebrated. As a women's health investor that has invested in 7+ women's health companies, we are yet to see any of them scale,‚Äù Deepali Nangia, a partner at Speedinvest, wrote in response to Hartvigsen‚Äôs LinkedIn post. ‚ÄúFlo's achievement is a very strong signal to the market that [direct to consumer] women's health is monetizable in Europe and that there is money to be made here; this is what investors need to see so more money flows into women's health companies. Not to say that the challenges faced by women in pitching are any less, but we must celebrate all wins that lead to more capital deployed into this sector,‚Äù she argued.

Nangia added that she wasn‚Äôt doubting there‚Äôs a problem, ‚Äúbut every win should not be turned around to a problem‚Ä¶ Many people have been working on solving for this problem, which includes many women of course but also men.‚Äù

Another commenter added: ‚ÄúIf anything, let this be a door for more investors to look closely at the female health industry and invest their money there? Could this be an example of men allies? If it had to be a company founded and led by men, well thank you very much for opening the door, now let the rest go through.‚Äù

Priya Oberoi, partner at women‚Äôs health-focused VC Goddess Gaia Ventures, added: ‚ÄúFlo reaching series C [unicorn] status with 60 mln active users is a win for #womenshealth - helping to close that 131 year gender health gap and getting products and services out there to improve the lives of women.‚Äù

""We firmly believe that women's health has been critically overlooked, undervalued and underfunded for far too long,"" Flo said in a statement to Sifted. ""Our sincere hope is that Flo‚Äôs funding will inspire more investors to recognise the immense potential in this space."" The company added: ""We're proud to say that more than half (56%) of Flo's employees are women, including our leadership team.""

It‚Äôs an important debate, and, readers, I‚Äôm curious to hear your thoughts: why aren‚Äôt there more female-founded femtech unicorns?

METHODOLOGY:
------------

* Investigators conducted a prospective cohort study among 61 general practitioners (GPs) in France, most of whom had not previously used the MoCA.
* The GPs administered the test to 221 patients aged 50 years and older (mean age, 66 years) without known impairment during routine consultations.
* The main outcome was MoCA feasibility, defined as completion in less than 15 minutes, the average time required to complete the alternate Mini Mental State Examination.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

* On an average, the GPs completed MoCA administration in just 8 minutes (range, 5-30 minutes).
* Fully, 82% of the tests were completed in 10 minutes and 97% in less than 15 minutes.
* On the basis of MoCA score, 62% of screened patients had mild cognitive impairment (18-25 points) and 4% had moderate cognitive impairment (10-17 points), while the rest had normal cognition.
* Most GPs reported that using the MoCA was a positive experience, in particular noting that it was easy and quick to use in daily practice.
* GP difficulties with the test were related to patient hearing loss, whereas patient difficulties were related to lack of concentration leading to misunderstanding of instructions.

IN PRACTICE:
------------

""This study confirms the quick and easy MoCA use during routine consultations in general practice to screen for early cognitive impairment from the age of 50,"" the authors wrote. The high prevalence of mild cognitive impairment found highlights ""the importance of early screening to promote early support for patients and their entourage,"" they added.

SOURCE:
-------

The study was led by Cassandre Carton, MD, University of Lille, Lille, France, and was published online in BJGP Open.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Limitations included the low participation rate, a lack of in-depth exploration of GPs' views of the MoCA, and administration of the test at a consultation selected by the GP.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

The study did not receive any funding. The authors reported no competing interests.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

A recent study found higher incidences of exposed bone and osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer who underwent dental extractions soon after radiotherapy, with the risk particularly elevated in those who received higher radiation doses.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Guidelines recommend removing nonrestorable teeth before radiation therapy to prevent osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer, but this can delay treatment by 2-4 weeks, potentially affecting overall survival. An alternative is to perform extractions after radiation, with a caveat that radiation can affect patients' oral health following an extraction.
*   Prospective data assessing outcomes among patients receiving extractions soon after radiation therapy ‚Äî when complications may be more minimal ‚Äî don't exist.
*   Researchers evaluated the safety of performing dental extractions within 4 months of radiation therapy and the associated risks for exposed bone and osteoradionecrosis.
*   The study included 50 patients with head and neck cancer, enrolled from January 2020 to September 2022.
*   The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of exposed bone; secondary outcomes were the incidence of osteoradionecrosis and adherence to recommended post-radiation extractions. The median follow-up period was 26 months.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   A total of 30 patients had between 1 and 28 extractions at a median of 64.5 days (range, 13-152 days) after therapy, while 20 patients declined extractions. Out of those who had extractions, 26 patients had them performed within the recommended 4-month window following radiation therapy.
*   Among all patients, 13 experienced an exposed bone event, 12 of which occurred in patients who had post-radiation extractions; 8 of 13 patients with exposed bone were later diagnosed with osteoradionecrosis.
*   The 2-year cumulative incidences of exposed bone were 27%, 40%, and 7% among all patients, those who underwent extractions, and those who declined extractions, respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidences of osteoradionecrosis were 18%, 23%, and 7% among all patients, those who underwent extractions, and those who declined extractions, respectively.
*   Among patients who received post-radiation extractions, a mean oral cavity dose ‚â• 35 Gy was associated with greater risk for exposed bone at 2 years (58%) and osteoradionecrosis (39%). An average mandible dose ‚â• 31.5 Gy produced similar results.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

Post-radiation extractions, even when performed soon after the completion of radiation therapy, are ""unsuitable for routine use,"" particularly at high oral cavity or mandibular doses, given the risk for exposed bone and osteoradionecrosis, the authors concluded.

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study, with Matthew C. Ward, MD, from Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Charlotte, North Carolina, was [published online](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2822270?) in _JAMA Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead & Neck Surgery_.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

The study had a small sample size, limited generalizability, and a short follow-up. Confounding factors could have affected the results.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The study funding source was not declared. Several authors received grants and personal fees outside this work.

TOPLINE:
--------

For people aged 75 years or older experiencing non‚ÄìST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), an invasive treatment strategy may not be better than a conservative one for a composite of cardiovascular death and non-fatal myocardial infarction.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   Prospective, multicenter, randomised SENIOR-RITA trial in the United Kingdom.
*   About 1518 patients aged ‚â• 75 years with NSTEMI were randomly assigned to the conservative strategy (best medical care) vs the invasive strategy (coronary angiography and revascularisation plus best medical care).
*   Frail patients and those with comorbidities were included.
*   The outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Median follow-up was 4.1 years.
*   There were no significant between-group differences in the primary outcome or cardiovascular death between the invasive strategy group and the conservative strategy group.
*   However, non-fatal myocardial infarction occurred in 11.7% of the invasive strategy group and 15.0% of the conservative strategy group, a significant difference (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-0.99).
*   In addition, over a 5-year period, invasive treatment resulted in, on average, 29 more days free from cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction than with conservative treatment.

IN PRACTICE:
------------

""Using contemporary angiography and interventional strategies, with the radial artery used as the access site in 89.3% of the patients, bleeding and procedure-related complications were minimal,"" the authors wrote.

SOURCE:
-------

The study was conducted by a UK-based team and was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Recruitment fell short of the goal of 1668 participants, with four in five screened participants not entering the trial. There were fewer outcome events than expected.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

The study was funded by the British Heart Foundation.

- A comprehensive study involving over 39,000 women aged 45+ years reveals no link between a history of migraine and an elevated risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD) over a follow-up of up to 22 years.
- Of the 685 women diagnosed with PD during this period, only 18.7% had a history of migraine, while 81.3% did not. This prompts a critical reflection on how we perceive the relationship between different health conditions.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

A history of migraine is not associated with an elevated risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) in women, regardless of headache frequency or migraine subtype, a new study suggests.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Researchers analyzed data on 39,312 women health professionals aged ‚â• 45 years and having no history of PD who enrolled in the Women's Health Study between 1992 and 1995 and were followed until 2021.
*   At baseline, 7321 women (18.6%) had migraine.
*   The mean follow-up duration was 22 years.
*   The primary outcome was a self-reported, physician-confirmed diagnosis of PD.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   During the study period, 685 women self-reported a diagnosis of PD.
*   Of these, 18.7% of reported cases were in women with any migraine and 81.3% in women without migraine.
*   No significant association was found between PD risk and a history of migraine, migraine subtypes (with or without aura), or migraine frequency.
*   Migraine was not associated with a higher risk for PD than nonmigraine headaches.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""These results are reassuring for women who have migraine, which itself causes many burdens, that they don't have to worry about an increased risk of Parkinson's disease in the future,"" study author Tobias Kurth, Charit√© - Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, said in a [press release](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1054724%3F).

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study was led by Ricarda S. Schulz, MSc, Charit√© - Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin. It was [published online](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209747) on August 21 in _Neurology_.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

The study's findings may not be generalizable to other populations, such as men and non-White individuals. The self-reported data on migraine and PD may be subject to inaccuracies. PD is often not diagnosed until symptoms have reached an advanced stage, potentially leading to cases being underreported. Changes in the status and frequency of migraine over the study period were not accounted for, which may have affected the results.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The authors did not disclose any specific funding for this work. The Women's Health Study was supported by the National Cancer Institute and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Two authors reported having financial ties outside this work. Full disclosures are available in the original article.

Alec Freyn, virology researcher at Moderna and co-first author, stated: ‚ÄúThis study is the first in a nonhuman primate model where we compare an investigational mRNA mpox vaccine directly to the current standard of care.‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúWhen we put those vaccines head-to-head in primates, we saw improved responses from the mRNA vaccine in terms of not just protection from survival but also fewer lesions, shorter duration of disease, and less viral shedding in the blood and respiratory tract.‚Äù

Originally designed to combat smallpox, MVA vaccines contained weakened whole viruses. Yet, this weakening means that they provide limited protection compared to other vaccines. The use of mRNA technology enables vaccines to be developed to only include parts of the virus that are most likely to induce a lasting, protective immune response without exposing the person to a whole infectious virus. The investigational mpox mRNA vaccine is composed of four viral antigens that are essential for the virus to attach and enter host cells.

Previous research has demonstrated that mRNA vaccines can prevent lethal mpox infections in nonhuman primates but their ability to lessen disease severity has not been tested. Therefore, to directly compare the investigational mRNA vaccine to MVA vaccines, the team vaccinated six macaques with each vaccine and then exposed them to a lethal strain of mpox virus eight weeks after their initial vaccine dose. Also, they exposed a control group of six unvaccinated animals to mpox. Then, after infection, the researchers monitored the macaque‚Äôs health for four weeks and collected blood samples to study their immune response.

Disease severity
----------------

Five of the unvaccinated control animals did not survive, whereas all 12 vaccinated animals did, regardless of which vaccine was used. The mRNA-vaccinated animals lost less weight and had fewer lesions than MVA-vaccinated animals, despite both vaccines limiting disease severity compared to the control group.

Furthermore, the mRNA vaccine shortened disease duration, measured by the number of days for which the animals showed lesions, by more than 10 days compared to the MVA vaccine. Lower viral loads were in the blood and throat swabs, indicating that it might be more effective at reducing transmission.

Jay Hooper, virologist at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and senior author explained: ‚ÄúWith the mRNA technology, we‚Äôre able to produce a vaccine that gives quite potent responses with a very tolerable safety profile‚Ä¶We‚Äôve been trying to get a vaccine that will prevent spread like ACAM2000¬Æ but without the safety issues. This is showing that mRNA technology might be able to fill that niche.‚Äù

Immune response
---------------

The mRNA vaccine resulted in a higher number of antibodies and antibodies with more diverse immune functions. Different classes of antibodies that were associated with enhanced viral control and fewer lesions were identified.

Furthermore, the vaccine demonstrated potential to induce cross-immunity to other Orthopoxviruses, whereas the MVA vaccine results in smaller immune responses that are not as strongly neutralising for more remotely related Orthopoxviruses. Serum from the macaques immunised with the mRNA vaccine ‚Äúneutralised not only mpox but also vaccinia, cowpox, rabbitpox, camelpox, and ectromelia virus,‚Äù Freyn said. ‚ÄúWe believe that this vaccine may protect from other Orthopoxvirus threats that may emerge in the future.‚Äù

Now, Moderna‚Äôs mRNA-1769 vaccine is being assessed in a Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT05995275) to determine the safety, tolerability and immune response of a range of doses of mRNA-1769.

The headline result from the MATINEE trial of IL-5 inhibitor Nucala (mepolizumab) in adults with COPD was a statistically significant reduction in the annualised rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared to placebo that GSK said was ""clinically meaningful."" In the study, Nucala was added to inhaled maintenance therapy for COPD.

GSK has been studying Nucala in COPD for some time, and in 2017 reported mixed results for the drug in two earlier phase 3 trials called METREX and METREO.

METREX involved patients with a range of eosinophil levels and showed a statistically significant improvement for Nucala versus placebo on exacerbation rates. However, in METREO ‚Äì which focused on patients with higher levels only ‚Äì the difference between the two arms was not significant.

The company decided to file for approval regardless, but the FDA declined to approve the new indication in 2018, following the advice of an advisory committee, which found that GSK had not proved efficacy. It seems MATINEE will allow GSK to try its luck again.

The size of the improvement over placebo ‚Äì which reportedly extended for up to two years in the trial ‚Äì won't be available until the study is presented at a future medical congress, but is strong enough to warrant discussions with regulators about extending the indications for Nucala, according to the pharma group. It has previously suggested approval for COPD could come in the US in the first half of next year.

Nucala has been approved to treat severe eosinophilic asthma for almost a decade, and in the interim has had its label extended to include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome.

The drug remains one of GSK's top products, with sales of ¬£856 million ($1.1 billion) in the first half of this year, up 15%. COPD could open up a massive new market for the drug, which still has several years of patent life left before it could face biosimilar competition.

The lung disease affects more than 300 million people globally, with up to 40 of patients exhibiting type 2 inflammation characterised by a raised blood eosinophil count, which would make them suitable for treatment with Nucala.

Elevated eosinophil levels are associated with more severe COPD and a higher rate of exacerbations, the sudden flare-ups in symptoms that signal the progression of the disease and can lead to hospitalisation.

The MATINEE data comes at a time when options for COPD are on the up, after a decade with no new therapies.

In July, the European Commission became the first regulator worldwide to approve Sanofi and Regeneron's big-selling IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor Dupixent (dupilumab) as a treatment for the progressive lung disease, shortly after Verona Pharma got the go-ahead from the US FDA for its PDE 3/4 inhibitor Ohtuvayre (ensifentrine).

Dupixent ‚Äì which is due for a verdict from the FDA as a COPD therapy later this month ‚Äì was cleared for adults with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils, while Ohtuvayre can be used in all patients regardless of eosinophil levels.",gpt-4o-mini

- Patients treated with lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) showed improved response rates, highlighting its effectiveness even among those with high-risk features like unmutated IGHV or TP53 mutations. This contradicts previous assumptions that high-risk patients would benefit less from such therapies.
- üìä Objective response rates (ORR) varied between patient subgroups: 41.5% in unmutated IGHV patients versus 63.2% in those with mutated IGHV. Similarly, for those with 17p deletions, the ORR was 47.1%, indicating robust outcomes across different risk profiles.
- Notably, patients with less tumor burden and fewer prior treatment lines experienced better responses‚Äî54.5% ORR in those with 3 or fewer lines of treatment compared to 44.6% in those with more than 3 lines.

- Risk factors like inflammatory markers and lower creatinine clearance rates were linked to increased neurological toxicity, which merits careful monitoring post-treatment.

William G. Wierda, MD, PhD, emphasized the potential for better outcomes when aiming for a less refractory patient population or employing debulking strategies before liso-cel treatment.

Response outcomes with liso-cel were consistent regardless of the presence of high-risk disease features in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) saw improved response outcomes with lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel; Breyanzi) which were consistent regardless of high-risk disease features. Further, lower tumor burden and fewer lines of prior treatment may have correlated with better responses, according to post hoc analysis findings from the phase 1/2 TRANSCEND CLL 004 trial (NCT03331198) presented at the 2024 Society of Hematologic Oncology Annual Meeting (SOHO).

Among patients with unmutated IGHV (n = 41) and those without (n = 19), the objective response rate (ORR) with liso-cel was 41.5% vs 63.2%, respectively (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.13-1.27), and the complete response (CR) rates were 22.0% vs 21.1% (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.28-3.98). For patients with 17p deletions (n = 34) and those without (n = 51), the ORR was 47.1% vs 45.1% (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.45-2.58), and the respective CR rates were 26.5% vs 13.7% (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 0.75-6.82). Additionally, for patients with TP53-mutated disease (n = 36) and those without (n = 50), data showed an ORR of 41.7% vs 50.0% (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.30-1.69) and CR rates of 22.2% vs 16.0% (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.50-4.46).

The ORR for patients with 17p deletions plus TP53 mutations (n = 25) and those without (n = 60) was 44.0% vs 46.7%, respectively (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.35-2.30). The CR rates in each group were 28.0% vs 15.0% (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 0.72-6.78). For patients with complex karyotype (n = 52) and those without (n = 34), the ORR was 44.2% vs 52.9% (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.30-1.68), and the CR rates were 19.2% vs 17.6% (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.36-3.40). Patient age did not appear to influence the likelihood of a response.

The median number of prior lines of therapy was 4 (IQR, 3-6) for patients with a response (n = 41) compared with 6 (IQR, 4-8) among those without a response (n = 46). Investigators reported that the ORR was 54.5% (95% CI, 32.2%-75.6%) among patients with a maximum of 3 prior lines of treatment (n = 22) and 44.6% (95% CI, 32.3%-57.5%) in those with more than 3 prior lines (n = 65; OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.56-3.93).

Study treatment yielded an ORR of 63.2% (95% CI, 46.0%-78.2%) for patients without bulky disease (n = 38) compared with 31.7% (95% CI, 18.1%-48.1%) in those with bulky disease (n = 41; OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.46-9.37). The mean sum of the product of perpendicular diameters (SPD) was 21.5 U/L (95% CI, 15.6-29.7) in patients with a CR (n = 14) compared with 40.9 U/L (95% CI, 34.1-49.1) in those who did not achieve a CR (n = 65). Additionally, patients who achieved a CR (n = 14) had a mean Œ≤-2 microglobulin level of 3.4 U/L (95% CI, 2.8-4.2) vs 5.4 U/L (95% CI, 4.5-6.5) in those without a CR (n = 61).

‚ÄúOne of the more important features of these data and analysis is that patients did respond, including those who had high-risk features [such as] unmutated [IGHV], 17p deletion, TP53 mutations, and complex karyotype. Better outcomes in terms of achieving response were seen in patients who had a lower bulk of disease,‚Äù William G. Wierda, MD, PhD, said in the presentation. ‚ÄúOverall, I believe that these data support an expectation and anticipation that better outcomes would be seen with this strategy in looking at a less refractory population of patients who are earlier in the course of their disease and/or looking at strategies to debulk the disease prior to [treatment with] liso-cel.‚Äù

Wierda is from the Department of Leukemia in the Division of Cancer Medicine at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

In the open-label, multicenter TRANSCEND CLL 004 study, patients underwent lymphodepletion with fludarabine at 30 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide at 300 mg/m2 for 3 days prior to treatment with liso-cel at a recommended phase 2 dose of 100 x 106 CAR-positive T cells.

For this post hoc analysis, investigators assessed how pretreatment variables such as demographic features, disease characteristics, and biomarker lab tests correlated with response and safety outcomes following treatment. Efficacy end points included the ORR and CR rates. Safety end points included any grade and grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurological events.

Patients 18 years and older with relapsed/refractory CLL or SLL and disease progression on or ineligibility for prior Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors were able to enroll on the trial. Other requirements for study entry included having an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and adequate bone marrow, organ, and cardiac function.

Of 87 patients in the full efficacy-evaluable population, the median age was 65 years (IQR, 59-69), and the median number of prior lines of therapy was 5 (IQR, 4-7). Additionally, most patients had Rai stage III or IV disease at screening (51%). In terms of risk factors, patients presented with unmutated IGHV (47%), 17p deletions (39%), TP53-mutated disease (41%), and complex karyotype (60%).

Any-grade neurological events affected 46% of patients, and 20% had events that were grade 3 or higher. Of note, the mean SPD was 49.1 cm2 (95% CI, 40.7-59.2) in patients with any neurological event (n = 38) and 27.7 cm2 (95% CI, 21.6-35.7) in those without any neurological events (n = 41). Additionally, the mean C-reactive protein level was 16.6 mg/L (95% CI, 9.6-28.5) in patients with neurological toxicity (n = 38) compared with 5.1 mg/L (95% CI, 3.5-7.5) in those without (n = 47).

Any-grade neurological events occurred in 53.3% (95% CI, 26.6%-78.7%) of patients with an estimated creatine clearance (CrCl) rate of less than 60 mL per minute (n = 15) compared with 43.7% (95% CI, 31.9%-56.0%) in those with an estimated CrCl rate of 60 mL per minute or higher (n = 71; OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.48-4.51). Additionally, grade 3 or higher neurological toxicity was reported in 46.7% (95% CI, 21.3-73.4%) and 14.1% (95% CI, 7.0-24.4%) in each respective group (OR, 5.34; 95% CI, 1.58-18.00).

Overall, Wierda noted that inflammatory markers, bulky disease, and lower estimated CrCl rates may increase the risk of neurological toxicity following treatment with liso-cel.

Europe's billionaires are taking a growing interest in expensive full-body-scans ‚Äî and startups are popping up all over Europe offering them

This article first appeared in Sifted‚Äôs Daily newsletter, sign up here.

Earlier this week, I visited one of Paris‚Äô few longevity clinics dedicated to preventative medicine ‚Äî and the only one that describes itself as a tech startup.

Hidden behind an unassuming Haussmannian door, just a few minutes away from the Paris Opera, the centre has been operating for nine months. The startup behind it, Zoƒ´, promises customers a ‚Äú360-degree check-up‚Äô ‚Äî a three-hour series of tests and exams, ranging from blood tests to eye scans through spirometry and gut microbiome analyses.

The objective? Collect millions of data points on up to 200 biomarkers that are in turn analysed by an AI model, in order to deliver lifestyle recommendations that, promises Zoƒ´, will prevent disease and improve customers‚Äô long-term wellness.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about adding years of life, but rather life to years,‚Äù says Zoƒ´ cofounder ‚Äî and former special advisor to French president Emmanuel Macron ‚Äî Isma√´l Em√©lien. ‚ÄúThe goal is to learn the body‚Äôs ‚Äòuser manual‚Äô to prevent illnesses and enable people to live in good health for longer.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not for everyone. Membership to Zoƒ´ is ‚Ç¨3.6k per year, which includes an annual checkup as well as the follow-up recommendations. That‚Äôs roughly the cost of a membership to Soho House, says Zoƒ´'s CFO Antoine Attali ‚Äî and the startup's customers usually belong to the same social circles.

The clinic caters to premium needs, from snacks elaborated by world-famous chef Alain Ducasse to a balneotherapy section modelled on ‚ÄòJapanese thermal baths‚Äò, featuring a snow cabin (?) and a mineral bath that is, I am told, ‚Äútwice as salty as the Dead Sea‚Äù.

Attali tells me that in the long-term, Zoƒ´ hopes to become accessible to everyone, and that prices will go down to a similar level to your average WiFi subscription.

For now, though, preventative health remains a hobby of the upper-class. In fact, Zoƒ´'s investors are all private individuals; the company‚Äôs ‚Ç¨20m seed round, which it raised in 2022, included a good number of high-profile billionaires such as Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saad√© and Moderna CEO St√©phane Bancel.

And Zoƒ´ is not the only longevity startup appealing to the ultra-rich. Spotify founder Daniel Ek is behind similar ventures, including Sand Clinic in Stockholm, where customers can receive full body check-ups and treatments ranging from vacuum therapy to red light saunas ‚Äî with membership expected to cost between ‚Ç¨1,000 and ‚Ç¨10,000 a month.

Ek is also the founder of healthtech Neko Health, which has built a full-body scanner for health data collection that it says helps doctors detect potential diseases earlier. The company has a clinic in Stockholm and has just opened a new spot in London, right in the middle of Marylebone, where it prices a one-hour scan at ¬£299 ‚Äî almost double the price of a visit to the Stockholm clinic when it opened in 2023 (‚Ç¨180).

Despite the cost, the proposition seems appealing enough. Neko Health says it already has a waiting list of 22k people; Zoƒ´ says it has ‚Äúaround 1k members‚Äù to date and is currently carrying out a dozen check-ups per day ‚Äî but the startup is confident that it can ramp up to reach its maximum capacity of 35k annual check-ups in the next five years.

Whether or not the preventative treatments promised by startups like Zoƒ´, Neko Health and Sand Clinic will ever reach the masses remains to be seen; what seems certain for now is that billionaires won‚Äôt get tired of full-body-scanning anytime soon.

Key Points

**Question** What is the cost-effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)‚Äìguided risk-stratified mammography screening intervals in the United Kingdom National Breast Cancer Screening Program?

**Findings** This decision analytical model evaluated 4 AI-based risk-stratified screening interval regimens in comparison with the current United Kingdom screening program. The net monetary benefit of introducing the optimal regimen ranged from approximately ¬£60.4 million (US $77.3 million) to ¬£85.3 million (US $109.2 million).

**Meaning** These results suggest that AI-based risk stratified breast cancer screening programs may be more cost-effective screening programs, providing additional health benefits with fewer resources than universal screening intervals for all.

**Importance** Previous research has shown good discrimination of short-term risk using an artificial intelligence (AI) risk prediction model (Mirai). However, no studies have been undertaken to evaluate whether this might translate into economic gains.

**Objective** To assess the cost-effectiveness of incorporating risk-stratified screening using a breast cancer AI model into the United Kingdom (UK) National Breast Cancer Screening Program.

**Design, Setting, and Participants** This study, conducted from January 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024, involved the development of a decision analytical model to estimate health-related quality of life, cancer survival rates, and costs over the lifetime of the female population eligible for screening. The analysis took a UK payer perspective, and the simulated cohort consisted of women aged 50 to 70 years at screening.

**Exposures** Mammography screening at 1 to 6 yearly screening intervals based on breast cancer risk and standard care (screening every 3 years).

**Main Outcomes and Measures** Incremental net monetary benefit based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and National Health Service (NHS) costs (given in pounds sterling; to convert to US dollars, multiply by 1.28).

**Results** Artificial intelligence‚Äìbased risk-stratified programs were estimated to be cost-saving and increase QALYs compared with the current screening program. A screening schedule of every 6 years for lowest-risk individuals, biannually and triennially for those below and above average risk, respectively, and annually for those at highest risk was estimated to give yearly net monetary benefits within the NHS of approximately ¬£60.4 (US $77.3) million and ¬£85.3 (US $109.2) million, with QALY values set at ¬£20‚ÄØ000 (US $25‚ÄØ600) and ¬£30‚ÄØ000 (US $38‚ÄØ400), respectively. Even in scenarios where decision-makers hesitate to allocate additional NHS resources toward screening, implementing the proposed strategies at a QALY value of ¬£1 (US $1.28) was estimated to generate a yearly monetary benefit of approximately ¬£10.6 (US $13.6) million.

**Conclusions and Relevance** In this decision analytical model study of integrating risk-stratified screening with a breast cancer AI model into the UK National Breast Cancer Screening Program, risk-stratified screening was likely to be cost-effective, yielding added health benefits at reduced costs. These results are particularly relevant for health care settings where resources are under pressure. New studies to prospectively evaluate AI-guided screening appear warranted.

Early detection of breast cancer is a top priority for the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS). The NHS largely uses an age-based screening strategy, inviting women aged 50 to 70 years for mammography screening triennially; most other countries with a breast screening program adopt a biennial program. This one-size-fits-all approach might be improved by tailoring screening so that those at highest risk receive the greatest intensity of screening (risk-based screening).

The NHS is considering the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into mammogram interpretation for breast screening in the future. AI is currently not used in NHS breast screening appointments in the UK due to a lack of high-quality prospective studies, but emerging prospective data are promising.

In parallel with AI for cancer detection, AI for risk prediction has been proposed. One such model (Mirai) interprets data automatically generated from mammogram screenings, without the need for data collection through questionnaires. The AI model offers an immediate estimation of an individual‚Äôs short-term risk of cancer incidence following a mammogram with negative findings. The AI model is open source and freely available for research and is arguably the best (retrospectively) validated AI model for short-term breast cancer risk assessment. One analysis included an external validation across 7 hospitals spanning 3 continents, and overall, evidence suggests that in the short term, it attains a higher area under the receiving operating characteristics curve than classical risk models or breast density.

While the performance of the AI model for risk assessment is highly promising, one area that has not been rigorously evaluated is whether using the model to guide screening could offer value for money. Our aim was therefore to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of integrating risk-stratified screening using the model into the UK National Breast Cancer Screening Program, through a health economic model. We considered risk-based screening strategies that would be expected to require the same number of screens as the current triennial program, assuming perfect adherence. In practice, strategies that involve extended screening intervals for a larger proportion of the population than those who receive more frequent screening might require fewer screens overall.

Specific risk-stratified breast cancer screening regimens (RSBCRs), determined by risk thresholds, were based on recent work that used a simplified deterministic model to evaluate potential effectiveness. These RSBCRs involve screening intervals aligned with corresponding risk thresholds tailored for the AI model chosen for this research. In this report, we developed an economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 4 AI-based screening strategies in comparison with the current screening program. The economic model was then used to estimate health-related quality of life, survival, and NHS costs (reported in pounds sterling; to convert to US dollars, multiply by 1.28) over the lifetime of the female population eligible for screening in the UK. Results from our analysis might inform future prospective evaluations of AI-guided screening.

This study was conducted from January 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024. We followed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) reporting guideline and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence methods of technology appraisal manual. We developed a discrete event simulation model in R, version 4.2.2, using the simmer‚Äô package (R Project for Statistical Computing) to accommodate individual attributes that evolve over time within the simulation such as breast cancer risk. The work was funded by Cancer Research UK and the policy research unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions. Because the data are drawn from publicly available sources, ethics approval is not required for decision modeling in the UK.

The following 4 strategies were distinguished by screening intervals in years for groups categorized by a 3-year risk score (RS):

1. One year (RS, ‚â•2.57%), 2 years (RS, 1.32%-2.57%), 3 years (RS, 1.22%-1.32%), or 6 years (RS, ‚â§1.22%)
2. One year (RS, ‚â•2.72%), 3 years (RS, 1.23%-2.72%), or 6 years (RS, ‚â§1.23%)
3. Two years (RS, ‚â•2.79%), 3 years (RS, 1.35%-2.79%), or 6 years (RS, ‚â§1.35%)
4. One year (RS, ‚â•2.20%), 3 years (RS, 1.23%-2.20%), or 4 years (RS, ‚â§1.23%).

The model focused on 5 dynamic processes: (1) Women transition between risk groups based on screen attendance and AI-model‚Äìassessed risk scores. (2) Mammogram accuracy is based on breast density, which changes as women age. (3) Attendance patterns to screening appointments are influenced by age and attendance history. (4) Attendance history and time intervals between screenings impact cancer stage. (5) Cancer prognosis is influenced by age, where it was identified (at regular screening or not), and attendance history, with worse outcomes for women who have not attended breast screenings.

Structure and Model Events

depicts the model structure, illustrating the sequence of clinical events and potential pathways from initiation to screening, cancer detection, and mortality. Women enter the model at the first screening invitation at 50 years of age, with subsequent invitations occurring at regular intervals until 70 years of age. Each screening appointment includes an updated AI risk assessment, determining the timing of the next screen invitation. If a woman misses her initial screening, invitations are sent every 3 years thereafter. The model ends when individuals reach cancer-related mortality or mortality from all other causes.

At entry, women are assigned predetermined ages of noncancer mortality and have a chance of developing breast cancer up to 74 years of age, sourced from Office for National Statistics life expectancy tables (2018-2020) and NHS breast cancer registry data. The age at which symptomatic cancer is detected in a primary care setting is sampled from 2020 incidence data, adjusted for age-related lead time in the UK screening program using overdiagnosis estimates. Screening may identify cancer at an earlier age than this determined age of symptomatic cancer. Data on attendance from 2018 to 2019, stratified by age and screening history, were used to calculate attendance probability to a screening invitation. The NHS incurs a cost of ¬£14.52 (US $18.59) for each screening invitation (details of screening costs are in eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Screening invitations end at 70 years of age or the nearest subsequent year if screening is not scheduled at 70 years of age. For instance, in simulating the current program with screenings every 3 years, a woman attending screening at 68 years of age would receive her last invitation at 71 years of age, after which any developing cancers would be detected symptomatically.

Model Event: Screening Appointment

Attending women undergo a mammogram; if cancer is detected, further assessments are conducted. Breast density and AI model scores are from UK women aged 46 to 74 years and applied based on age and cancer presence. Details are available in eMethods 1 in Supplement 1.

In the model, a woman‚Äôs age for potential tumor detection is set before her first screening and remains constant throughout her life. Screening detection ages are calculated by subtracting the tumor presence period from the age at which symptomatic cancer is detected. The tumor presence period is derived from national breast screening program data and is based on age, with mean durations ranging from approximately 6 years at 35 years of age to 8 years at 85 years of age.

Each mammography session has a cost of ¬£54.32 (US $69.53) and results in a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss of 0.0014 due to associated discomfort. A summary table of the diagnostic accuracy of mammography is presented in eTable 1 in Supplement 1. Sensitivity estimates are sourced from recent estimates in a population-based screening program and vary based on breast density, ranging from 62% (dense) to 90% (not dense). False-positive results occur when no underlying tumor is present during a screening, with chances ranging from 1.5% (not dense) to 2.9% (dense), and they cause a QALY loss of 0.0771. Mammographic results indicating cancer leads to further assessments, which verify whether the cancer is present, and involve mammography, ultrasonography, and biopsy totaling ¬£484.90 (US $620.67). Detailed breakdowns of mammography‚Äôs diagnostic accuracy, screening and further assessment costs, and screen-related QALY losses are found in eTables 2 and 3 in Supplement 1.

Model Event: Interval Between Screening Appointments

Between screening appointments, cancers are detected immediately in primary care on reaching the age of symptomatic detection, with the primary care appointment costing ¬£37.00 (US $47.36), and further assessment totaling ¬£484.90 (US $620.67) NHS cost. Mortality due to other causes than breast cancer can occur and aging results in a health utility loss based on a published formula.

Model Event: Cancer Treatment and Survival

After cancer detection, cancer is classified as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive tumor TNM stages I to IV, determined by age and mode of detection (at a screening appointment or symptomatically in primary care) using UK population screening data. The stage distribution is adjusted based on the time since the last screen, using US data comparing stage distribution by screening frequency. Detailed methodology and sources can be found in Hill et al.

Treatment-related health losses and NHS costs vary by age, stage, mode of detection (screen or symptomatic), and time since detection (for follow-up costs and health recovery). Health utility losses after cancer are taken from multivariate regression, using the utility decrements on age, stage, and mode of detection. Recovery times are 11 years for screen-detected and interval cancers and 12 years for symptomatic cancers, based on peak health-related quality of life values post cancer detection. Stage 4 cancers are assumed to show no improvement in quality of life.

Cancer survival estimates come from Office for National Statistics mortality statistics and multivariable regressions. Mortality hazard ratios by stage and detection mode are applied to age-based mortality to determine life expectancy. Cancer treatment-related utility losses, costs, and survival estimates are available in eTables 4 to 6 in Supplement 1.

Economic and Clinical Outcomes

Costs were assessed from a UK payer perspective and reported in 2022 pounds sterling. Quality-adjusted life-years and costs were discounted at 3.5%. The main economic outcome is incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) per woman, which quantifies in monetary terms the net benefit of interventions by reflecting the potential alternative use of intervention resources for other health care treatments. Incremental net monetary benefit is established from differences in patient costs, and from assigning a monetary value to the difference in QALYs, which we assume to be ¬£20 000 (US $25 600), ¬£30 000 (US $38 400), and ¬£1 (US $1.28) per QALY. The latter represents a scenario where a decision-maker is reluctant to spend additional NHS resources to increase population health. Population-wide INMB is derived by multiplying the per-woman INMB by the population size of women at 50 years of age eligible for screening invitations, which is 174‚ÄØ523, sourced from the 2022 national breast screening program data. Clinical outcomes include tumor stage at detection, cancers detected during screening, breast cancer deaths prevented by RSBCRs in the population (174‚ÄØ523 women), and the number of screens conducted.

All analyses were performed using R, version 4.2.2 (R Program for Statistical Computing). We conducted external validation of the model against targets derived from the 2022 national breast screening program data. To identify where savings occur, cost results are divided into screening-related costs and those for treating DCIS and invasive cancers. Cancer treatment costs are broken down by stage (DCIS, stages I-II, and stages III-IV) and mode of detection (screen-detected and interval cancers). Deterministic sensitivity analysis is conducted by adjusting the cancer treatment and screening costs, health-related quality of life losses from cancer and screening, and mammography sensitivity. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is performed using 250 Monte Carlo simulations using probabilistic sensitivity analysis parameter distributions reported in eTable 8 in Supplement 1. The probability that each RSBCR is cost-effective is illustrated on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Population-wide INMB estimates from the 250 Monte Carlo simulations are calculated across cost per QALY values ranging from ¬£1 (US $1.28) to ¬£100 000 (US $128 000).

shows base-case economic results and the annual impact of the economic results in the entire population. All the AI-based regimens were associated with reduced NHS costs and increased QALYs compared with the current screening program. The strategy of conducting screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk had the highest additional net monetary gain per woman invited for screening. This amounts to ¬£346 (US $442.88) and ¬£489 (US $625.92) under the assumption of QALY values being ¬£20‚ÄØ000 (US $25 600) and ¬£30 000 (US $38 400), respectively. Consequently, this leads to an annual net monetary benefit within the NHS screening program totaling ¬£10.6 million (US $13.6 million) for QALY values of ¬£1, ¬£60.4 million (US $77.3 million) for QALY values of ¬£20 000, and ¬£85.3 million (US $109.2 million) for QALY values of ¬£30 000. The 3 alternative approaches had comparable figures for the net monetary benefit gained. For instance, the screening strategy of 6 yearly, triannual, and biannual screening has the smallest incremental net monetary benefit, amounting to ¬£188 (US $240.64) and ¬£236 (US $302.08) per person, assuming QALY values of ¬£20‚ÄØ000 and ¬£30 000, respectively. This resulted in an annual population incremental net benefit of ¬£32.7 million (US $41.9 million), assuming ¬£20‚ÄØ000 per QALY and ¬£41.2 million (US $52.7 million), assuming ¬£30‚ÄØ000 per QALY.

shows the clinical and screening program results. The clinical outcomes of all regimens showed an improvement compared with the current screening program. Compared with the current screening program, conducting screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk resulted in a higher number of screen-detected cancers (10‚ÄØ549 vs 8943), a greater percentage of DCIS cancers at detection (17.1% vs 13.6%), a reduction in the number of screens (mean [SD], 3.22 [0.02] vs 4.68 [0.05]), and prevention of 834 deaths due to breast cancer.

Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis Results

The deterministic sensitivity analysis results align with the cost-effectiveness of screening regimens found in the base-case model. Screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk was likely to be most beneficial. Risk-stratified breast cancer screening regimens maintained their cost-effectiveness compared with the current program and each other. The breakdown of NHS costs incurred by women show screening costs are lower in the RSBCR than in the current program. Cancer treatment costs incurred are larger for RSBCRs due to life extension for patients with cancer from increased screen detection of cancers and early cancer detection (see Table 2).

Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis Results

The probabilistic sensitivity analysis results demonstrate an improvement in the cost-effectiveness of screening regimens compared with the base-case model, without a shift in the ranking of programs from most to least cost-effective. The regimen with screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, or 6 years had the highest probability of being cost-effective (59% at ¬£20‚ÄØ000 [US $25 600] per QALY) and had the largest net monetary benefit for all cost per QALY thresholds. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve shows the regimen of 2, 3, or 6 years was likely to be the least cost-effective alternative option for RSBCRs, and the current screening program has a negligible probability of being cost-effective across all cost per QALY thresholds.

Under our analytic model, AI-based risk-stratified screening is likely to be cost-effective compared with the current one-size-fits-all screening program. Our findings are consistent with previous modeling studies demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of risk-stratified screening, whether based on traditional risk factors like family history or newer methods such as polygenic risk scores. However, our model is the first to suggest that health care resources might be reduced with RSBCRs, while attaining at least the same effectiveness for the population. This study is also the first to assess the cost-effectiveness of AI interpretation of breast images for risk assessment during routine screening. This might be more feasible at scale than the other risk assessment methods.

While the estimated incremental economic benefits per individual invited to breast screening may seem modest in the base-case model, ranging from ¬£188 (US $240.64) to ¬£346 (US $442.88), the annual monetary gains for the NHS might be substantial, estimated to range from ¬£32.7 million (US $ 41.9 million) to ¬£60.4 million (US $77.3 million). In the probabilistic model, these savings are around 3 times larger. The health economic model suggests that RSBCRs can reduce screening utilization, NHS costs, and invasive cancer in the population and increase QALYs. The reduction in the number of screenings with an RSBCR could free up resources to address screening backlogs and reduce wait times where those problems exist in the UK, potentially further improving breast cancer outcomes.

Annual screening RSBCRs lead to higher percentages of screen-detected cancers and greater percentages of DCIS cancers at detection, along with higher QALYs. However, biennial screening for the highest-risk group, with corresponding 3 and 6 yearly screening for other risk groups, incurs lower costs due to fewer screenings. Screen utilization is not the only explanation of the difference in cost-effectiveness among the regimens. Other contributing factors are the proportion of individuals at medium and high risk within the population undergoing intensified screening surveillance, their uptake to screening appointments, and the accuracy of mammography in women with denser breast tissue that makes cancers harder to detect. Although cost-effectiveness is important, it is not the only factor to consider when comparing the benefits of the regimen. For example, a population accustomed to the UK‚Äôs triennial screening program may view a 6-year gap between screenings as unacceptable, favoring a 4-year interval instead. This change to an RSBCR screening program with a 4-year screening interval for patients at low risk would generate an annual monetary benefit of ¬£50 million (US $64 million), assuming a QALY is valued at ¬£20 000 (US $25 600). Significant variations in screening frequency within programs can be accepted by patients. In the UK, colonoscopy surveillance guidelines for cancer vary by risk level, with no surveillance for patients at low risk, every 3 years for patients at intermediate risk, and annually for patients at high risk.

This study has some limitations. First, the model is parametrized for the UK. Findings may not be directly generalizable to alternative geographical populations, such as the US or elsewhere in Europe. Clinical guidelines in these regions often recommend universal annual or biennial screening, while a triennial screening program is in place in the UK, and typically screening also begins at earlier ages in these regions. Therefore, the comparator screen detection rates based on triennial screening, on which the model depends, are likely to differ across populations with varied screening frequencies and onset ages. For example, in a setting where annual screening is the norm, all the regimens considered would reduce costs but also effectiveness. Further analysis using the model could usefully contribute to decisions on the economic value of decreasing intensity of screening based on breast cancer AI in such settings.

In this decision analytical model study of risk-based screening with AI-based risk assessment, risk-based screening delivered health benefits while using fewer NHS resources compared with the current UK breast screening program. New studies to prospectively evaluate AI-guided screening appear warranted.

- A recent retrospective cohort study in the UK revealed significant demographic disparities in access to cardiac surgery, particularly highlighting that women, Black individuals, and those from deprived areas are notably less likely to receive timely surgical interventions.
- üìâ The study, analyzing data from over 292,000 heart disease patients (2010-2019), found that:
   - Women were 59% less likely to undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) compared to men.
   - Black patients faced a 32% lower likelihood of receiving CABG than White patients.
   - Individuals living in the lowest socioeconomic quintile were 35% less likely to access CABG and experienced a startling 24% higher risk of mortality within a year.

TOPLINE:
--------

In the United Kingdom, women, Black people, and those living in deprived areas are less likely to be offered heart surgery and have higher postoperative mortality rates.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   Retrospective cohort study of the UK National Health Service and national mortality data.
*   Among adults admitted to the hospital with heart disease from 2010 to 2019, authors examined demographics of 292,140 who had coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or valve surgery.
*   Outcomes of interest were access to surgery, in-hospital mortality, 1-year mortality, and hospital readmission.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Worse outcomes occurred in women vs men, Black vs White people, and people living in the lowest vs highest socioeconomic quintile.
*   These groups were 59%, 32%, and 35% less likely to get CABG and 31%, 33%, and 39% less likely to get valve surgery, respectively, than comparator groups.
*   They were 24%, 85%, and 18%, respectively, more likely to die within a year after CABG.
*   After valve surgery, women were 19% more likely to die, and people from the most deprived areas were 10% more likely to die within a year.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

MADRID ‚Äî In a rat study, two versions of an experimental monthly injectable semaglutide-loaded hydrogel show extended release over 1 month and good tolerance. If found to be safe and effective in people, a once-monthly formulation could improve patient adherence and quality of life of those with type 2 diabetes or obesity.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   About half or more patients taking semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist approved for treating obesity with or without type 2 diabetes, may discontinue treatment with their once-weekly subcutaneous injections or daily oral pills at 12 months, but longer-acting formulations may increase drug efficacy and patient adherence.
*   Researchers have developed two versions of an injectable semaglutide-loaded hydrogel mixed with a pair of degradable polymers that chemically bond together.
*   After injection, the formulations form either a gel disk or microgel suspension that enables a gradual and prolonged drug release.
*   To identify the optimal formulation, researchers analyzed the hydrogel compositions in vitro to study drug release kinetics, duration of effectiveness, and semaglutide loading content.
*   The experimental semaglutide-loaded hydrogel disk or microgel particles were injected subcutaneously in six wild-type Wistar Han male rats of normal weight (250-300 g) to characterize semaglutide pharmacokinetics and hydrogel biocompatibility.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   The formulation could be easily injected using a 25G needle, with gelation starting within minutes of mixing.
*   In both versions, a single injection of the hydrogel-based formulations in rats demonstrated a minimal initial early release, followed by a consistent release over the course of 1 month.
*   The product was well tolerated with no edema or inflammatory reaction during the treatment period.
*   The hydrogel could be easily degraded by enzymes in in vitro studies.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""A small dollop of gel, known as a 'depot,' of the semaglutide-laden hydrogel is injected under the skin,"" said Claire M√©gret, PhD, lead author of the poster presentation, in a news release. ""Our pre-clinical results demonstrate that the regular, slow release of semaglutide over one month after administering a single dose, with limited early release, is achievable,"" she added.

Primary Care Women's Health Forum | 09 September 2024

**In Anticipation of Guidelines Live 2024, the PCWHF Provides a Taster of its Sessions in the Women‚Äôs Health Stream, Which Will Address Key Issues Around Menopause and HRT**

The Primary Care Women‚Äôs Health Forum (PCWHF) is excited to return to Guidelines Live in 2024, following its success delivering presentations to full lecture theatres in 2023. This year, PCWHF speaker sessions will have a primary-care relevant, practical focus, underpinned by realistic case studies to illustrate the application of guidelines in the real world.

Published in 2022, the Women‚Äôs Health Strategy for England notes that there is not enough focus on women-specific issues such as menopause. Over the past few years, healthcare professionals have faced challenges such as shortages of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT), a lack of licensed options for testosterone as part of HRT, and funding for the fitting of intrauterine devices and implants that may not cover the costs of the procedure.

In the first of the PCWHF speaker sessions on Day 1, **Dr Julie Oliver**, PCWHF Chair, will discuss the recent British Menopause Society guideline on the management of unscheduled bleeding in women taking HRT. The guideline provides a new approach to risk stratification, and includes a helpful one-page summary flowchart to guide management. It also answers the perennial question ‚ÄòHow high is too high?‚Äô‚Äîthat is, what is the oestrogen dose needed to increase the amount of progestogen in an HRT regime? Dr Oliver is an NHS GP in County Durham, with an extended role in women‚Äôs health and a long history of speaking at conferences such as Guidelines Live.

On the Day 2 of Guidelines Live 2024, **Dr Caroline Cooper** will give a contraception update, with a focus on new guidance. Dr Cooper will explore contraceptive options for women over 40 years of age, emphasising safety, efficacy, and individualised care approaches. Dr Cooper is an experienced GP with an extended role in women‚Äôs health. She is also a faculty-registered trainer, and has served on the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare committees, as well as being a current director of the PCWHF.

Next, **Dr Angela Wright** will continue the HRT theme, but adding relevance to younger women, by discussing testosterone and libido. Informed by her experience of primary and secondary care NHS work, Dr Wright‚Äôs speaker session will explain how those in primary care can support women who have complex menopause issues, sexual dysfunction, and premenstrual disorders. Dr Wright is a fellow of the European Committee of Sexual Medicine, and an active committee member of the British Society of Sexual Medicine.

### The Primary Care Women‚Äôs Health Forum

These Guidelines Live sessions are supported by the Primary Care Women‚Äôs Health Forum (PCWHF), a group of 10,000 healthcare professionals with a special interest in women‚Äôs health. The PCWHF aims to promote and progress standards in women‚Äôs health in primary care through education, resources, and events, and lobbies on behalf of its members to determine future strategic direction and policymaking for women‚Äôs health.

TOPLINE:
--------

Middle-aged adults who consume more ultra-processed foods have an elevated risk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that is mediated in part through circulating biomarkers.

METHODOLOGY: 
-------------

Investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study of 207,012 middle-aged adults without RA from the UK Biobank who completed 24-hour dietary recalls. Foods and beverages were classified as (1) unprocessed or minimally processed foods, (2) processed culinary ingredients, (3) processed foods, or (4) ultra-processed foods (eg, soft drinks, sweet or savoury packaged snacks, reconstituted meat products, pre-prepared frozen dishes). The main outcome was the incident RA based on hospital diagnoses.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

Overall, 0.9% of participants received an RA diagnosis during a median follow-up of about 12 years. Relative to peers in the lowest quintile of ultra-processed food consumption, participants in the highest quintile had a 17% greater adjusted risk for RA. The risk rose across quintile (P < .05) and increased by 6% with each standard deviation increase in ultra-processed food intake. Mediation analyses suggested that inflammatory, lipid, and liver enzyme biomarkers explained 3.1%-14.8% of the association between ultra-processed food intake and RA risk. Findings were similar regardless of participants' age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, household income, and healthy diet score.

IN PRACTICE: 
-------------

""Lower [ultra-processed food] consumption is recommended to reduce RA incidence,"" the authors wrote, noting that up to half of the food consumed in the United Kingdom now falls into the ultra-processed category. ""Dietary guidelines should prominently feature the detrimental effects of [ultra-processed foods], and recommendations to curtail their consumption should be integrated into public health initiatives, to mitigate the risk of RA,"" they added.

- A recent study analyzed outcomes for 1,282 women in Queensland, Australia, who underwent bariatric surgery prior to pregnancy.üåè The findings reveal that women who had this surgery are likely to give birth to smaller babies compared to those who did not. 
- Key statistics indicate a concerning trend: bariatric surgery correlates with a higher risk of having smaller than average infants (Odds Ratio [OR], 1.78) and a lower risk for larger babies (OR, 0.54). üìâ  
- Additionally, the rate of preterm births in women who had surgery was significantly higher (10.5% vs. 7.8%; _P_ = .007).  Babies of these women also weighed less on average at birth (3223 g vs. 3418 g; _P_ < .001). 
- On a positive note, those who underwent the procedure experienced lower rates of gestational diabetes (15.1% vs. 19.9%; _P_ < .001) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (3.7% vs. 5.4%; _P_ = .01). 

While bariatric surgery seems to reduce some maternal risks, the trade-off appears to be an increased risk to the neonate. How should we balance these factors when advising patients considering pregnancy post-surgery? ü©∫

**TOPLINE:**
------------

Women who underwent bariatric surgery prior to pregnancy are more likely to have smaller babies than those who did not undergo the surgery.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   In a cross-sectional matched study, researchers analyzed pregnancy and newborn outcomes among 1282 women in Queensland, Australia, who underwent bariatric surgery prior to pregnancy and gave birth between 2013 and 2018.
*   The outcomes were pregnancy complications, birth weight of newborn, length of pregnancy, whether the baby was smaller or larger than average, and preterm births.
*   Women who had surgery were matched 1:10 on age, smoking status, and body mass index to those who did not have the surgery.
*   Overall, 93% women had a laparoscopic gastric sleeve surgery, 4.3% had a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery, and the remaining 2.7% had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   Bariatric surgery was associated with a higher risk of having smaller than average babies (odds ratio \[OR\], 1.78; 95% CI, 1.46-2.17; _P_ < .001) and a lower risk of having larger than average babies (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44-0.66; _P_ < .001).
*   The rate of preterm births was higher in women who underwent bariatric surgery before pregnancy than in matched women (10.5% vs 7.8%; _P_ = .007).
*   Babies born to women who underwent bariatric surgery had lower average birth weights (3223 g ¬± 605 g vs 3418 g ¬± 595 g; _P_ < .001).
*   Women who underwent bariatric surgery showed lower rates of gestational diabetes (15.1% vs 19.9%; _P_ < .001) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (3.7% vs 5.4%; _P_ = .01).

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""Overall prepregnancy bariatric surgery, including restrictive procedures, appears to reduce some maternal pregnancy risks but increases the neonatal risk of lower birth weight, early preterm delivery, and their potential associated long-term sequalae,"" the authors wrote.

**SOURCE:**

This study was led by Jade Eccles-Smith, of the Department of Obstetric Medicine, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in Brisbane, Australia. It was [published online](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378/(24/)00899-8/abstract) on September 01, 2024, in the _American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology_.

**LIMITATIONS:**  
-----------------

The study's limitations included the potential bias from manual data entry and missing information. Additionally, the lack of data on maternal diet and weight gain limited the ability to assess how these factors might have affected the growth of the baby.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The researchers did not report any specific funding. The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

TOPLINE:
--------

Reduced antibiotic prescribing for pneumonia in primary care, including practices with the lowest prescribing rates, appears to be safe and does not lead to untowards adverse events or increased hospitalisations.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   Retrospective analysis examining the association between antibiotic prescribing rates for respiratory tract infection (RTI) in 1471 general practices (GP) in England and adverse outcomes ‚â§ 30 days (hospitalisation for pneumonia, primary care re-consultation for respiratory/lung conditions, additional antibiotic prescriptions, and new prescription at re-consultation).
*   Data were derived from the Clinical Practice Research Datalinlk (2005-2019) of all ages with GP consultation.
*   GP practice prescriptions were divided by quintile: highest, second highest, third highest, fourth highest, and lower.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Sample comprised 9,913,568 patients across 1471 GP practices with 35,921 RTI-related consultations. There were 29,498,958 prescriptions written, and 1,535,740 hospitalisations. 
*   RTI-related prescriptions, 1-6 days post-RTI consultations fell steadily from 13.9% (higher prescribing practices) to 5.2% (lower).
*   Annual GP RTI-related consultations and prescriptions increased from 2005, peaked in 2012 and then declined; higher numbers were recorded for women, and prescriptions increased with number of comorbidities and with age.
*   No significant changes were seen in hospitalisation for pneumonia ‚â§ 6 days of an RTI-related consultation over quintiles and included the lowest (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1.02).
*   RTI-related consultations ‚â§ 30 days were significantly higher for lowest prescribing practices (aOR, 1.209; 95% CI, 1.206-1.212) but additional and subsequent prescriptions were significantly lower (aOR, 0.317 [95% CI, 0.314-0.321] and 0.706 [95% CI, 0.699-0.712], respectively).

IN PRACTICE:
------------

""For the vast majority of primary care practices, further reductions in RTI-related antibiotic prescribing, up to an order of two- to three-fold reductions, should be possible without an increase in adverse clinical outcomes,"" the authors wrote.

SOURCE:
-------

The study was led by James Stimson, UK Security Agency, UK, and appeared online in the Journal of Infection.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Limitations included inconsistent diagnostic coding, a lack of information on prescription fills or delayed starts.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

The study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. The authors expressed no financial disclosures of interest.

However, recent updates from the Endocrine Society offer new guidance for assessing and supplementing vitamin D in healthy individuals.

- The **Endocrine Society** now recommends **against routine testing** of vitamin D levels in asymptomatic individuals, including children and those over 75 years of age. This could significantly reduce unnecessary testing burdens.

- üí° Surprisingly, the **recommended daily intake** for vitamin D by the Endocrine Society has increased to **600 IU** (15 mcg) for ages 1-70, and **800 IU** (20 mcg) for those 71 and older, much higher than the UK‚Äôs current recommendation of **400 IU**. 

- Key populations advised for **empiric supplementation** include:
  - **Children and adolescents** (1-18 years) to help prevent rickets and reduce respiratory infections.
  - Individuals aged **75 and older** to lower mortality risk.  
  - **Pregnant women**, to minimize risks related to pre-eclampsia and neonatal mortality, with recommended doses ranging from **600-5000 IU**. 
  - Adults with **high-risk prediabetes** to prevent progression to diabetes.

As we consider these updates, it begs the question: How can we optimize vitamin D supplementation while navigating existing healthcare practices and patient beliefs? ü§î

Read This Article to Learn More About:

*   the Endocrine Society‚Äôs recommendations on who should and should not undergo testing for vitamin D status, and which asymptomatic groups should receive empiric supplementation
*   recommended daily reference intakes for vitamin D in the updated guideline, which differ from those of other guidance 
*   potential barriers to implementation of the Endocrine Society guideline in the UK.

Vitamin D is made in the skin by the action of ultraviolet B (UVB) light (accounting for 80‚Äì90% of total body vitamin D), or ingested in natural or fortified foods or supplements (accounting for 10‚Äì20% of total body vitamin D). It is metabolised to 25(OH) vitamin D in the liver, then a second hydroxylation occurs, primarily in the kidneys, to produce the active form 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D. Through its interaction with the vitamin D receptor, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D helps to control calcium and phosphate levels in the body, thus impacting musculoskeletal health. Vitamin D is also associated with nonmusculoskeletal conditions, including respiratory infections, cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic diseases, autoimmune conditions, cancers, and neurological illnesses. Drugs, genetic polymorphisms, terminal ileal disease, malabsorption, and kidney disease can all influence the metabolism and circulating level of vitamin D.

The identification of links between vitamin D status and certain conditions has resulted in increased testing for 25(OH) vitamin D, the recommended biomarker, as well as widespread supplementation, both prescribed and purchased in pharmacies and health stores across the UK. Supplementation further increased in the COVID-19 pandemic, during which free 400-IU vitamin D supplements were provided to vulnerable people practising shielding. However, there is growing concern that individuals for whom vitamin D supplementation (albeit at a low dose) is currently recommended are not receiving or choosing not to take the appropriate supplementation.

### The Updated Endocrine Society Guideline on Vitamin D

Against this backdrop, Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline was presented at the Endocrine Society meeting in June 2024, and simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. The updated guideline offers pragmatic advice on blood testing for 25(OH) vitamin D and vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of disease in healthy people in particular, and may cause some controversy by altering current practice in the UK. It is supported by an open-access systematic review, published in the same issue of the journal, that focuses on 14 clinically relevant questions relating to vitamin D testing and supplementation.

Other guidelines on vitamin D in specific groups are available in the UK, including the Royal Osteoporosis Society (ROS)‚Äôs Vitamin D and bone health: a practical clinical guideline for patient management‚Äîwhich covers the management of osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and people at risk of these conditions‚Äîand other guidelines focusing on chronic diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; see the Useful Resources box at the end of the article). These groups are not covered by the Endocrine Society guideline, which seeks to provide vitamin D guidance for asymptomatic populations.

This article examines the updated Endocrine Society guideline, highlighting the key practice-changing recommendations for primary care.

**Overview of the Updated Guideline**

### Daily Reference Intakes and Definitions of Key Terms

In 2011, the US National Academy of Medicine (NAM; formerly the Institute of Medicine) established daily reference intakes (DRIs) for vitamin D of 600 IU (15 mcg) for those aged 1‚Äì70 years and 800 IU (20 mcg) for those aged 71 years and older, and these are retained as the baseline intakes for all groups for which supplementation is not recommended in the Endocrine Society guideline. Notably, these daily intake recommendations are higher than the 10-mcg reference nutrient intake (RNI; equating to 400 IU), advocated in the UK since 2016 for everyone in the general population aged 4 years or older by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN).

The term ‚Äòempiric supplementation‚Äô is used throughout the updated guideline to mean supplementation that exceeds the DRI for a given age group and is derived from natural and fortified foods and oral supplements without testing of 25(OH) vitamin D levels. When supplementation is recommended within the guideline, the range of doses used in clinical trials is documented, together with the approximate weighted average daily dose equivalent, as demonstrated in the preceding paragraph.

### Overarching Themes

Three central topics are covered in the guideline: assessment of vitamin D status, mode of vitamin D supplementation, and skin pigmentation and vitamin D. These are discussed in more detail in Box 1.

Box 1: Three Overarching Topics in the Updated Endocrine Society Guideline

**Assessment of Vitamin D Status**

Previously, guidance on vitamin D focused mainly on those with vitamin D deficiency, who it was assumed would most benefit from supplementation. However, the optimal 25(OH) vitamin D blood level for asymptomatic, healthy people has yet to be determined, and varies between guidelines.

The Endocrine Society guideline development group sought to use subgroup analyses of RCT evidence to identify vitamin D thresholds for patient-important outcomes, but found that there is no clear lower threshold below which supplementation has been demonstrated to be beneficial and that, for some populations, those with a high blood level of vitamin D may still benefit from supplementation. Based on the RCT evidence in the associated systematic review, baseline testing or monitoring of 25(OH) vitamin D status in the asymptomatic people covered by the guideline is therefore not recommended. As a result, the Endocrine Society no longer recognises the thresholds for 25(OH) vitamin D levels given in its 2011 guideline‚Äîvitamin D sufficiency (at least 75 nmol/l) and insufficiency (more than 50 nmol/l but less than 75 nmol/l) based on serum testing.

**Mode of Vitamin D Supplementation**

Throughout the guideline, daily vitamin D dosing as oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or D2 (ergocalciferol) is recommended over higher-dose, intermittent supplementation for healthy people in whom supplementation is recommended. This is particularly relevant in older people, in whom higher intermittent vitamin D doses may be ineffective or increase the risk of falls or fractures.

Use of active vitamin D metabolites, such as calcitriol, is not recommended in the Endocrine Society guideline‚Äîthese can cause hypercalcaemia, and need careful monitoring. They are, however, recommended in some other guidelines for individuals with compromised vitamin D metabolism, such as those with CKD.

**Skin Pigmentation and Vitamin D**

The updated guideline does not make specific recommendations on skin pigmentation and vitamin D, firstly because of a lack of clinical studies looking specifically at pigmentation, and secondly because of controversy about the relative impact of studying skin pigmentation versus race and ethnicity. These topics are addressed in an accompanying open-access commentary.

RCT=randomised controlled trial; CKD=chronic kidney disease

**Prioritised Clinical Questions**

### Recommendations Against Routine Testing

In the updated guideline, the 14 prioritised clinical questions relating to vitamin D testing and supplementation in healthy, asymptomatic individuals are discussed individually. Crucially, recommendations 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, and 14 recommend against routine testing for 25(OH) vitamin D in children and adults of all ages in the general population, including in those aged 75 years and older, during pregnancy, and in those with pigmented skin or obesity.

#### _Pregnancy_

In pregnancy, there is no evidence that only those with a low blood level of 25(OH) vitamin D stand to benefit from vitamin D supplementation; therefore, the Endocrine Society recommended against testing. However, despite the fact that the necessity of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is evidence-based, supplementation to the baseline levels recommended in this guideline is not widely adopted in the UK at present.

#### _Obesity_

People with obesity can have lower levels of circulating 25(OH) vitamin D, but this may reflect increased sequestration of the 25(OH) vitamin D in fat, its dilution in a larger fat mass, or decreased vitamin D hydroxylation in people with obesity. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation (daily vitamin D doses: 400 IU with calcium or 2000 IU without calcium) in people with obesity (body mass index over 30 kg/m2) showed no reduction in fracture risk; likewise, a range of RCTs found no decrease in the incidence of CV events, cancers, or respiratory infections in people with obesity receiving vitamin D supplementation. Therefore, based on current RCT evidence, a decision was taken not to routinely test or offer empiric supplementation in people with obesity, although further evidence will be explored in future updates.

#### _Pigmented Skin_

Increased melanin content in the skin reduces 25(OH) vitamin D production in response to sunlight exposure; it could be assumed, therefore, that people with deeply pigmented skin are at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency or are more likely to benefit from supplementation. However, the Endocrine Society examined the RCT evidence and found no trials comparing different skin colours, although many studies use self-declared race or ethnicity as unvalidated proxies for skin pigmentation. Moreover, there are no standardised methods for measuring skin pigmentation, and some factors associated with self-declared race, such as social determinants of health, may have more impact on 25(OH) vitamin D levels than skin colour. Therefore, the panel made a conditional recommendation supported by very low-quality evidence not to recommend 25(OH) vitamin D screening in this group. However, the panel did call for further research.

### Recommendations on Supplementation

The evidence-based recommendations on supplementation are discussed in Box 2.

Box 2: Recommendations on Supplementation in the Endocrine Society Guideline

**Recommendation 1: Children and Adolescents**

In children and adolescents aged 1‚Äì18 years, vitamin D supplementation is recommended to both prevent nutritional rickets and reduce the risk of respiratory tract infections. Daily doses of 300‚Äì2000 IU (7.5‚Äì50 mcg) were used to reduce respiratory infections in the RCTs examined by the systematic review, with a weighted mean of 1200 IU (30 mcg). Notably, in the US, supplementation with 400 IU (10 mcg) vitamin D is recommended for children younger than 1 year who are not exclusively formula-fed.

**Recommendations 2 and 4: The General Adult Population**

In the general population of adults aged under 50 years and 50‚Äì74 years, empiric vitamin D supplementation is not recommended. 'Empiric' refers to supplementation that exceeds baseline DRIs; generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing should follow the DRIs established by the NAM (600 IU [15 mcg] daily for those aged 18‚Äì70 years; 800 IU [20 mcg] daily for those older than 70 years).

**Recommendation 6: Adults Aged Over 75 Years**

In the general population of adults aged 75 years or older, empiric vitamin D supplementation is recommended to reduce mortality risk, based on high-certainty evidence showing small mortality reductions. Daily, lower-dose supplementation is recommended over irregular, higher doses. The daily doses used in the trials demonstrating reduced mortality ranged from 400‚Äì3333 IU (10‚Äì83 mcg), with a weighted average of 900 IU (23 mcg); however, many trial participants were also allowed to continue their own additional vitamin D supplements of up to 800 IU (20 mcg) during the studies.

**Recommendation 8: Pregnancy**

Empiric vitamin D supplementation is recommended during pregnancy to lower the risks of pre-eclampsia, intrauterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality, based on low-certainty evidence. The vitamin D doses used in the studies ranged from 600‚Äì5000 IU (15‚Äì125 mcg), and were provided daily or weekly. The estimated weighted average was approximately 2500 IU (63 mcg) daily. These doses are significantly higher than the 400-IU baseline vitamin D intake from foods and supplements currently recommended during pregnancy in the UK.

**Recommendation 10: High-risk Prediabetes**

In addition to lifestyle modification, empiric vitamin D supplementation is recommended in adults with high-risk prediabetes to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes, based on moderate-certainty evidence. High-risk prediabetes is defined as meeting two or three ADA glycaemia criteria for prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose [fasting glucose of 5.6‚Äì6.9 mmol/l], HbA1c 39‚Äì47 mmol/mol, or impaired glucose tolerance [2-h plasma glucose after 75-g OGTT of 7.8 mmol/l to less than 11.1 mmol/l]). The daily doses used in the studies ranged from 842‚Äì7543 IU (21‚Äì189 mcg), with an estimated weighted average of 3500 IU (88 mcg).

Because only HbA1c is currently used to identify prediabetes in the UK and a range of 42‚Äì47 mmol/mol is used, rather than the 39‚Äì47 mmol/mol range used in the US, it may prove difficult to identify those meeting this definition without additional testing of fasting blood glucose, as the OGTT is now not generally used in the UK, except for diagnosing gestational diabetes. Those with an HbA1c towards the top of the prediabetes range, or in whom HbA1c is increasing despite lifestyle interventions, can be considered high risk and may benefit from supplementation; however, UK guidance does not make specific recommendations about vitamin D supplementation in this group.

**Recommendation 11: Mode of Empiric Vitamin D Supplementation**

For adults aged 50 years and older in whom empiric vitamin D is recommended, daily, lower-dose vitamin D supplementation is recommended instead of intermittent, higher doses, because these have been shown in some studies to increase risk of falls or fractures.

RCT=randomised controlled trial; DRI=daily reference intake; NAM=National Academy of Medicine; ADA=American Diabetes Association; HbA1c=glycated haemoglobin; OGTT=oral glucose tolerance test

### Limitations of Evidence

Everyone in the clinical studies likely had some sun exposure and ingested some vitamin D from natural or fortified foods, and many studies allowed continuation of self-purchased baseline supplementation, making it difficult to evaluate the exact vitamin D intake in the individual studies informing the guideline. The authors were hampered by lack of RCT evidence of sufficient duration to provide data on conditions such as cancer, CV disease, or osteoporosis. Studies in those aged over 50 years often used a combination of calcium and vitamin D, making the effects of vitamin D alone unclear. Few studies included people with low baseline 25(OH) vitamin D levels.

**Comparisons With Other Guidance**

Several other guidelines cover vitamin D supplementation in healthy people, the recommendations of which differ from those of the Endocrine Society guideline on some points.

### Recommended Daily Intakes

Published in 2012, DHSC guidance suggests that people aged 65 years and older, with low or no sun exposure (housebound or covering skin for cultural reasons), or with darker skin may be at risk of vitamin D deficiency, and should take a daily 400-IU vitamin D supplement. Similarly, the 2018 SACN guidance, last reviewed in December 2023, recommends a ‚Äòsafe intake‚Äô of 8.5‚Äì10 mcg of vitamin D for infants from birth to 1 year and 10 mcg/400 IU daily for those aged 1‚Äì4 years, and sets a year-round RNI of 10 mcg for all those aged over 4 years in the UK, including pregnant and lactating women and those at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency. Both the DHSC and SACN guidelines therefore advocate a significantly lower intake than that of the NAM, used by the Endocrine Society guideline, which recommends a daily vitamin D dose of 600 IU for people aged 1‚Äì70 years, and 800 IU per day for those aged 71 years and over.

### Doses in Infants, Children, and Young People

The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) guidance on vitamin D in infants, children, and young people recommends that all infants ‚Äòshould receive a daily vitamin D supplement of 8.5‚Äì10 mcg from birth until one year old, unless they are consuming more than 500 mL of formula milk a day, as infant formula is fortified with vitamin D.‚Äô The guidance states that children aged 1‚Äì4 years should receive a daily vitamin D supplement of 10 mcg (400 IU). Separately, the RCPCH has said that parents should consider continuing the same vitamin D dose in children aged over 4 years, particularly through the winter months. These recommendations differ slightly from those of the Endocrine Society.

UK Government advice recommends that all children aged 6 months to 5 years are given vitamin supplements containing vitamins A, C, and D; these vitamin drops are free for children who qualify for the Healthy Start programme. Despite this guidance, most children do not receive vitamin D supplementation or achieve recommended intakes through diet and sun exposure, and rickets is now returning in children.

### Hidden Comorbidities

The NHS recommends caution with vitamin D supplements in certain individuals, such as those with kidney disease or sarcoidosis. Some conditions that preclude vitamin D supplementation will not be known at the time of prescribing, so care is required.

**Barriers to Implementation**

The biggest challenge in implementing the Endocrine Society guidance will be ensuring that clinicians understand that this guideline applies to asymptomatic, healthy people, and that its recommendations are not generalisable to other groups with, or at risk of, chronic diseases for which measurement of 25(OH) vitamin D or different dosing or treatment recommendations may be appropriate. The importance of this cannot be overstated.

Some of the further challenges that UK clinicians may have to overcome if they choose to implement the Endocrine Society guidelines are covered in the following sections.

### Obtaining Vitamin D From Natural Sources

Vitamin D is only found in significant amounts naturally in oily fish and egg yolk, with a small amount in some meats, including offal; however, some fat spreads, breakfast cereals, and yoghurts are fortified with vitamin D in the UK. Vitamin D is also made in the skin via the action of sunlight but, in the UK, UVB light in the necessary wavelength is only available between March and September. Sun avoidance may mean that some people do not make significant amounts of vitamin D in their skin; normal sunscreen use, often used at lower coverage than recommended, does not block vitamin D production, but high-factor sunscreens used on all exposed skin may compromise vitamin D status. Therefore, it is likely that, without supplementation, much of the population will not be achieving the Endocrine Society guideline‚Äôs DRIs for vitamin D of 600 IU for those aged under 70 years and 800 IU for those aged 70 years and over. Even meeting the daily RNI of 10 mcg (400 IU) recommended by the SACN may be challenging.

The UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) assesses the diet, nutrient intake, and nutritional status of people aged over 1.5 years living in private homes in the UK. Using a threshold of <25 nmol/l serum 25(OH) vitamin D, the NDNS found that, over a 4-year rolling programme (2008‚Äì2012), 22% of children aged 11‚Äì18 years, 23% of adults aged 19‚Äì64 years, and 21% of adults aged over 65 years had serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels below this threshold. Among children aged 11‚Äì18 years and adults aged 65 years or older, the proportion of individuals with vitamin D levels below the threshold increased to approximately 40% and 30%, respectively, during winter. Similarly, a longitudinal study of more than 6 million primary care patients in the UK with a mean follow up of 5.4 years demonstrated that one-third of those receiving vitamin D testing had a 25(OH)D level below 30 nmol/l.

### Entrenched Views About Supplementation

Recommendations to supplement vitamin D without measuring 25(OH) vitamin D levels have been in place for many groups in the UK for several years. This may feel counterintuitive if clinicians retain the idea that supplementation works best in those with the lowest blood levels of 25(OH) vitamin D. It will therefore be important to reassure clinicians and their patients that the recommendations in this guideline are based on solid RCT evidence. Indeed, supplementing when appropriate without the costs of testing may be cost-saving‚Äîfor example, in those with prediabetes or during pregnancy. However, the author acknowledges that encouraging extra supplementation may be challenging for those already facing a high daily pill burden.

### Health Inequalities

In the UK in recent years, it has been recommended that people purchase vitamin D supplements from retailers such as pharmacies and supermarkets rather than having them prescribed. This is likely to result in lower supplementation among those living in areas of deprivation, as well as among elderly people, who may not be able to source supplements. Also, variability in the vitamin D content of supplements purchased from different retailers may lead to over- or underdosing.

Despite widespread publicity campaigns aimed at increasing the uptake of the Healthy Start programme (which includes free multivitamin drops containing 400-IU vitamin D) among UK families experiencing deprivation, and despite the programme providing free vitamin D supplements in England during the COVID-19 pandemic, uptake of free supplementation remains low.

### Relevance to the UK

Although the Endocrine Society‚Äôs guideline development group includes researchers from the Netherlands and New Zealand, the remainder of the panel are from the US, and this may impact implementation of the recommendations in the UK. However, the studies in the systematic review informing the guideline have a global reach, and some were carried out in the UK.

**Summary**

The author has met with resistance from other clinicians and her practice population when trying to implement vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy, in infants and young children, and in those at risk of deficiency because of a lack of sunlight exposure. Supplementation in older adults without first measuring 25(OH) vitamin D level has also been challenged because of concerns about the lack of available evidence.

Anecdotally, laboratory teams concerned by escalating requests for 25(OH) vitamin D status have sought to restrict testing to people who are symptomatic or in high-risk groups, often by requesting a detailed history and completion of a complex request form. This is entirely appropriate, but may deter clinicians from requesting testing when it is required. The Endocrine Society guideline may help to decrease inappropriate testing in asymptomatic, healthy people, while reassuring clinicians that those in whom supplementation is recommended can receive it without the need for baseline measurements or monitoring of 25(OH) vitamin D level. Primary care teams have an important role to play in educating people about when vitamin D supplementation is appropriate. The guideline clarifies which groups are likely to benefit, and the level of supplementation to recommend or prescribe.

Key Points

*   Vitamin D status has been associated with a range of musculoskeletal and nonmusculoskeletal conditions, resulting in increased testing for 25(OH) vitamin D and widespread supplementation
*   The updated Endocrine Society guideline offers pragmatic advice on blood testing for 25(OH) vitamin D and vitamin D supplementation in healthy, asymptomatic people
*   This guideline does not apply to people with specific indications for 25(OH) vitamin D testing or vitamin D supplementation, including those with osteoporosis, osteomalacia, or other chronic conditions such as CKD or IBD
*   As the baseline intakes for all groups for which supplementation is not recommended, the Endocrine Society retains the NAM-established DRIs for vitamin D of 600 IU (15 mcg) for those aged 1‚Äì70 years and 800 IU (20 mcg) for those aged ‚â•71 years 
    *   these daily intake recommendations are notably higher than the 10-mcg (400-IU) RNI recommended by the SACN in the UK
*   Based on RCT evidence, the Endocrine Society recommends against routine testing in asymptomatic populations, including people aged ‚â•75 years, with obesity, or with skin pigmentation
*   The guideline recommends supplementation for: 
    *   children and adolescents aged 1‚Äì18 years‚Äîto prevent nutritional rickets and to lower the risk of respiratory infections (other guidelines already recommend supplementation during the first year of life)
    *   people aged ‚â•75 years‚Äîto reduce mortality
    *   during pregnancy‚Äîto reduce the risks of pre-eclampsia, intrauterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality
    *   those with high-risk prediabetes‚Äîto reduce the risk of progression to diabetes
*   'Empiric supplementation' refers to vitamin D intake that exceeds the DRI and is implemented without testing for 25(OH) vitamin D
*   Barriers to implementation of the guideline include entrenched views about who is eligible for supplementation and misconceptions about the evidence base for supplementation without testing.

**Implementation Actions for ICSs**

The following implementation actions are designed to support ICSs with the challenges involved in implementing new guidance at a system level. Our aim is to help you to consider how to deliver improvements to healthcare within the available resources.

*   **Recognise** the considerable implications of and operational issues associated with adopting the Endocrine Society guidance on vitamin D in your area
*   **Consider** establishing a multidisciplinary group to discuss the potential adoption and implementation of this guidance, involving Public Health colleagues, paediatricians, obstetricians, geriatricians, endocrinologists, and GPs
*   **Make clear decisions** on whether, if the guidance is adopted, supplementation is provided via NHS prescription (as some groups for which it is recommended are eligible for free prescriptions), and **explore** the budget and opportunity costs of such decisions
*   **Publish** the outcomes of any local decisions on formulary websites, with an explanation of these decisions and guidance on medication and testing regimens.

Implementation Actions for Clinical Pharmacists in General Practice

The following implementation actions are designed to assist clinical pharmacists in general practice during patient interactions related to vitamin D supplementation:

*   **conduct a training session**‚Äîas medicine experts, pharmacists are key in communicating new treatment guidelines. Conducting a clinical session can update the multidisciplinary team about vitamin D testing and supplementation effectively, ensuring alignment with current best practice and improving patient care
*   **collaborate with the local integrated care board**‚Äîto align processes with the latest clinical evidence, pharmacists can support the revision and update of protocols on vitamin D testing and supplementation to ensure that they reflect up-to-date guidance, in line with the local formulary and best practice
*   **create educational materials for patients**‚Äîchanges in treatment can lead to patient resistance when previous practices are entrenched. To ensure optimal patient outcomes, pharmacists can provide literature explaining why routine vitamin D blood tests may no longer be necessary, emphasising that these changes align with the latest best practice. For example, AccurRx templates can be created for the team to circulate information to patients as needed
*   **coordinate with local community pharmacies**‚Äîpatients often seek advice from community pharmacies about vitamin D deficiency and supplementation. Ensuring consistent messaging between GP practices and community pharmacies is crucial to avoid patient confusion. Pharmacists working in general practice can distribute new guidance to local pharmacies to guarantee that they are giving patients the most current information.
