The FDA has granted Priority Review Designation to SpringWorks Therapeutics and accepted its New Drug Application for mirdametinib to treat adult and pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN).

The investigational MEK inhibitor has been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of February 28, 2025. The rare genetic disorder arises from loss-of-function variants in the NF1 gene, which encodes for neurofibromin, a key suppressor of the MAPK pathway. There is an estimated global birth incidence of approximately 1 in 2,500 individuals, and approximately 100,000 patients living with NF1 in the United States.

""NF1 patients have approximately a 30-50% lifetime risk of developing plexiform neurofibromas, or PN, which are tumors that grow in an infiltrative pattern along the peripheral nerve sheath and that can cause severe disfigurement, pain and functional impairment; in rare cases, NF1-PN may be fatal,"" stated Spring Works.

Submission to the FDA included data from the phase 2b ReNeu trial (NCT03962543) evaluating mirdametinib in patients aged 2 years or older with NF1-associated PN causing significant morbidity. Results, presented in an oral presentation at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, demonstrated that mirdametinib objective response rates, improvement in pain and health-related quality of life, along with a ""manageable safety profile across both the adult and pediatric cohorts,"" according to SpringWorks.

The trial enrolled 114 patients to receive mirdametinib at a dose of 2 mg / m2 twice daily without regard to food. It was administered orally in a 3-week on, 1-week off dosing schedule as either a capsule or dispersible tablet.

The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate assessed by proportion of patients with a 20% or greater reduction in target tumor volume on consecutive scans in a 24 cycle treatment phase, measured by MRI.

""People living with NF1-PN are in need of new advances and we look forward to working with the FDA and EMA during their review processes as we prepare to bring our second medicine to patients suffering from devastating diseases,"" said Saqib Islam, Chief Executive Officer of SpringWorks, in the press release.

“Plexiform neurofibromas may sit next to or surround vital organs and can cause serious medical complications for patients. While progress has been made, there remains a pressing need for more treatment options, particularly for adults who currently have no approved therapy,” said Annette Bakker, PhD, CEO, Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF); Board Chair of CTF Europe. “CTF is dedicated to deploying its time, talent and funding towards accelerating the development of new treatments. We are thrilled that patients in the United States and Europe could soon have a new therapy available to them.”

2024-08-30 07:52:00,2024-08-31 03:41:58,"### Revolutionizing Anticoagulant Treatment: New Insights on Apixaban Versus Warfarin!
A recent study has successfully emulated the pivotal ARISTOTLE trial using real-world data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. This research indicates that apixaban shows noninferiority to warfarin in preventing stroke, but does not demonstrate superiority. Notably, the influence of warfarin’s therapeutic range on patient outcomes sheds light on treatment optimization. 

The implications are significant: understanding that effective anticoagulation management requires careful monitoring of individual patient circumstances and characteristics, especially when considering switching from warfarin to apixaban. As clinicians, how do you assess the appropriate use of anticoagulants in your practice? Share your experiences in the comments below!

Abstract
--------

### Background

Stroke prevention guidance for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) uses evidence generated from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, applicability to patient groups excluded from trials remains unknown. Real-world patient data provide an opportunity to evaluate outcomes in a trial analogous population of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) users and in patients otherwise excluded from RCTs; however, there remains uncertainty on the validity of methods and suitability of the data.

Successful reference trial emulation can support the generation of evidence around treatment effects in groups excluded or underrepresented in trials.

We used linked United Kingdom primary care data to investigate whether we could emulate the pivotal ARISTOTLE trial (apixaban versus warfarin) and extend the analysis to investigate the impact of warfarin time in therapeutic range (TTR) on results.

### Methods and findings

Patients with AF in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD Aurum) prescribed apixaban or warfarin from 1 January 2013 to 31 July 2019 were selected. ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria were applied to this population and matched to the RCT apixaban arm on baseline characteristics creating a trial-analogous apixaban cohort; this was propensity-score matched to warfarin users in the CPRD Aurum. ARISTOTLE outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression stratified by prior warfarin exposure status during 2.5 years of patient follow-up and results benchmarked against the trial results before treatment effectiveness was further evaluated based on (warfarin) TTR.

The dataset comprised 8,734 apixaban users and propensity-score matched 8,734 warfarin users. Results \[hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)\] confirmed apixaban noninferiority for stroke or systemic embolism (SE) \[CPRD 0.98 (0.82,1.19) versus trial 0.79 (0.66,0.95)\] and death from any cause \[CPRD 1.03 (0.93,1.14) versus trial 0.89 (0.80,0.998)\] but did not indicate apixaban superiority. Absolute event rates for stroke/SE were similar for apixaban in CPRD Aurum and ARISTOTLE (1.27%/year), whereas a lower event rate was observed for warfarin (CPRD Aurum 1.29%/year, ARISTOTLE 1.60%/year).

Analysis by TTR suggested similar effectiveness of apixaban compared with poorly controlled warfarin (TTR < 0.75) for stroke/SE \[0.91 (0.73, 1.14)\], all-cause death \[0.94 (0.84, 1.06)\], and superiority for major bleeding \[0.74 (0.63, 0.86)\]. However, when compared with well-controlled warfarin (TTR ≥ 0.75), apixaban was associated with an increased hazard for all-cause death \[1.20 (1.04, 1.37)\], and there was no significant benefit for major bleeding \[1.08 (0.90, 1.30)\]. The main limitation of the study’s methodology are the risk of residual confounding, channelling bias and attrition bias in the warfarin arm, and selection bias and misclassification in the analysis by TTR.

### Conclusions

Analysis of noninterventional data generated results demonstrating noninferiority of apixaban versus warfarin consistent with prespecified benchmarking criteria. Unlike in ARISTOTLE, superiority of apixaban versus warfarin was not seen, possible due to the lower proportion of Asian patients and higher proportion of patients with well-controlled warfarin compared to ARISTOTLE. This methodological template can be used to investigate treatment effects of oral anticoagulants in patient groups excluded from or underrepresented in trials and provides a framework that can be adapted to investigate treatment effects for other conditions.

Author summary
--------------

### Why was this study done?

*   Stroke prevention treatment guidelines for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are based on results from randomised controlled trials (RCTs); we do not know if these results are relevant to patients that would not have been eligible to be included in the RCTs.
*   This study used routinely collected health data from the United Kingdom to emulate an RCT that compared apixaban to warfarin, ARISTOTLE, and also looked at whether the benefit of apixaban compared with warfarin was impacted by the quality of warfarin therapy (measured by time in therapeutic range (TTR)).
*   Emulating an RCT for stroke prevention in patients with AF should help to understand how transferable RCT results are to “real-world” practices and whether this methodological approach can help to improve treatment options and outcomes for patient groups currently underrepresented in clinical trials.

### What did the researchers do and find?

*   The researchers looked at patients with AF in a UK primary care data prescribed apixaban or warfarin and applied a “reference trial emulation” approach, in which the ARISTOTLE trial eligibility, selection, and analysis approaches were applied to UK primary care data and results benchmarked against those of ARISTOTLE.
*   Patients prescribed apixaban had similar rates of outcomes to those prescribed warfarin in our cohort, and our results were successfully benchmarked against ARISTOTLE. Unlike ARISTOTLE, we did not see superiority of apixaban versus warfarin \[hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)\] for time to stroke or systemic embolism: 0.98 (0.82,1.19) in our cohort versus 0.79 (0.66,0.95) in ARISTOTLE.
*   We also found the benefit of apixaban versus warfarin differed for some outcomes depending on the quality of warfarin therapy with apixaban (i) superior only to poorly controlled warfarin therapy for major bleeding \[TTR < 0.75: 0.74 (0.63, 0.86), TTR ≥ 0.75: 1.08 (0.90, 1.30)\] (ii) associated with an increased risk of death compared only to well-controlled warfarin therapy \[TTR ≥ 0.75: 1.20 (1.04, 1.37), TTR < 0.75: 0.94 (0.84, 1.06)\].

### What do these findings mean?

*   Our results support the NICE guidelines on selecting treatment for stroke prevention in patients with AF and also provide reassurance on continuing warfarin in patients with high TTR.
*   We can use UK primary health care data to emulate a reference trial of treatments for the prevention of stroke in AF.
*   We can use the data and methods to look at how well treatments work in patients that would not have been included in RCTs such as those with multimorbidity or patient groups underrepresented in RCTs such as ethnic minority groups and older patients.
*   Study limitations include the possibility of residual confounding, a risk patients doing well on warfarin were overrepresented in our cohort, a lower proportion of Asian participants in our cohort compared with ARISTOTLE, and the likelihood of residual selection bias/misclassification in the TTR analysis.

Introduction
------------

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common type of cardiac arrhythmia with an estimated prevalence of 3.3% in UK adults aged ≥35 years \[[1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref001)\]. AF is a risk factor for stroke; patients with AF have a 5-fold increased risk of stroke compared with people without AF \[[2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref002)\], and around a quarter of all strokes are attributed to this arrhythmia \[[3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref003)\]. In addition, increased levels of mortality, morbidity, and disability with longer hospital stays are observed in stroke patients with AF compared with stroke patients without AF \[[4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref004),[5](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref005)\].

Pharmacological therapy recommended to reduce the risk of stroke in AF includes the use of oral anticoagulants (OACs). The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for AF since 2012 in the United Kingdom provided a choice of treatment alongside the older OAC class of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, which has been available for over 60 years. The VKA OACs require regular monitoring of international normalised ratio (INR) to keep patients in the optimal therapeutic range (typically 2.0 to 3.0) in which risk of both ischemic and bleeding events are minimised \[[6](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref006)\]. A patient may require dose adjustments to stay within their INR target range. A key measure of quality of warfarin treatment is, therefore, the time in therapeutic range (TTR), which estimates the proportion of time a patient has spent with INR within optimal range. A TTR of 0.75 or greater is often considered as indicating optimal INR control and suggests a patient is spending a high proportion of their time in their INR target range.

ARISTOTLE was a pivotal randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the DOAC apixaban designed to demonstrate noninferiority compared with warfarin in the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) in patients with AF. The results demonstrated superiority of apixaban over warfarin for both prevention of stroke/SE and safety (major bleeding) \[[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref007)\]. Results in the European Union patient subset from the trial suggested the observed superiority of apixaban might be dependent on how well warfarin therapy was managed in the comparator group \[[8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref008)\], an analysis that has not yet been performed outside of trial settings. In the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) review of ARISTOTLE, several professional groups noted the TTR of warfarin users in ARISTOTLE may be lower than what is typical in UK clinical practice \[[9](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref009)\].

Treatment guidelines for DOACs are based on evidence from RCTs; however, it is unclear whether these results extend to patient groups typically excluded from trials such as those with increased bleeding risk or severe comorbidities. While there have been a number of previous studies of DOAC effectiveness using noninterventional data, there remains uncertainty on whether the data sources and methods used have fully accounted for the lack of treatment randomisation and issues such as selection bias and confounding. Comparing results from real-world studies with RCT results is challenging due to differences in patient populations, treatment adherence, and study design. However, reference trial emulation involves use of an existing named RCT to (1) inform observational study design and (2) benchmark results against, providing confidence in validity of the selected observational methods and data \[[10](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref010)–[13](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref013)\]. The noninterventional analysis methods can then be applied, under a set of assumptions, to reliably estimate effects in groups of patients with AF who would have been excluded from (or underrepresented in) the reference trial \[[14](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref014)\] such as patients aged >80 that were underrepresented in ARISTOTLE compared with patients with AF in UK clinical practice and patients with increased bleeding risk that were excluded by the trial eligibility criteria.

There is increasing interest in trial emulation using observation data and in the application of recent developments in pharmacoepidemiology methods involving the inclusion of prevalent users. This study used a framework that involved coarsened exact matching to select patients matching the trial population on aggregate, and sampling of prevalent users in a way that avoids selection bias and emulates the process of screening into an RCT, to construct a cohort of patients similar to the target trial population that included both new and prevalent users. This methodological approach could be adapted to a variety of treatments and different therapeutic areas.

This study sought to (1) create an ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort using routinely collected primary and secondary care data in the UK, (2) benchmark results obtained in the ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort with ARISTOTLE results, and (3) explore whether apixaban treatment-effects in clinical practice are influenced by how well warfarin therapy is controlled.

Materials and methods
---------------------

This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline ([S1 STROBE](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s001) Checklist).

### Study design

A propensity score (PS) matched cohort study with emulation of a reference trial (ARISTOTLE).

### Setting/data sources

#### UK electronic healthcare records.

This study used noninterventional data from UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum, a database containing anonymised data from 738 primary care practices across England (approximately 13% of the population of England with 19 million patient records and 7 million active as of September 2018 \[[15](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref015)\]). CPRD Aurum contains information on clinical diagnoses, prescribing, referrals, tests, and demographic/lifestyle factors and is representative of the population of England in geographical spread, social deprivation, age, and sex \[[15](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref015)\]. This study also used 2 additional data sources linked to CPRD Aurum: Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data, which contain data on patients admitted to NHS hopsitals including diagnoses, admission, and discharge, and Office of National Statistics (ONS) mortality data.

#### The reference trial (ARISTOTLE).

ARISTOTLE was a randomised, double-blind trial completed in 2011, comparing apixaban with warfarin in the prevention of stroke and SE. The trial included 18,201 patients with AF and at least 1 additional risk factor for stroke. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority of apixaban compared with warfarin (noninferiorirty margin of 1.38 for the upper limit of the 95% CI of the hazard ratio (HR) for the primary outcome) and showed apixaban superiority for (1) the primary outcome of stroke or SE (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66, 0.95), (2) the safety endpoint of major bleeding (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.60, 0.80), and (3) death from any cause (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80, 0.99). The ARISTOTLE findings led to the NICE guidelines on stroke prophylaxis in patients with AF recommending apixaban as a treatment.

ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria and summary baseline patient characteristics were used to select a cohort of patients from CPRD Aurum analogous to the ARISTOTLE participants.

The use of CPRD and ARISTOTLE are described in a previous publication \[[14](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref014)\], and the use of CPRD for this project was approved by the MHRA Independent Scientific Advisory Committee ([S1 ISAC](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s002) Protocol). All data used in this study were anonymised.

### Patient selection

#### Step 1: Application of trial eligibility criteria to patients in CPRD.

We first selected HES-linked patients registered in CPRD Aurum between 1 January 2013 and 31 July 2019, who had at least 6 months between registration and the index date. ARISTOTLE recruited both new (warfarin-naïve) and prevalent (warfarin-experienced) users of warfarin with randomisation stratified on prior warfarin (or other VKA) exposure status (warfarin naïve or experienced). To be classified as warfarin-naïve patients were required to have no evidence of exposure to warfarin or other VKA in the 5 years prior to the index date. To enable selection of a similar cohort of patients in CPRD Aurum (including both new and prevalent users of warfarin), the following process was used in determining index date:

\- apixaban users

index date = first prescription of apixaban in the study period;

apixaban user classified as warfarin-naïve or warfarin-experienced at this date

\- warfarin users

for new users of warfarin: index date = first prescription of warfarin in the study period;

for prevalent users of warfarin: a pool of potential index dates was selected containing all prescription dates in the study period, with index date selected at the later treatment-history sampling stage (see step 3).

ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria (Table A2 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)) \[[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref007)\] were applied giving a trial-eligible cohort for apixaban users, a trial-eligible cohort of new users of warfarin, and a pool of potential index dates (with all potential index dates kept in regardless of ARISTOTLE eligibility at this stage) for warfarin continuers (prevalent warfarin users).

#### Step 2: Selection of apixaban trial-analogous patients in CPRD.

We selected a subset of the CPRD Aurum trial-eligible apixaban patients that better matched the ARISTOTLE apixaban participants based on aggregate summaries for the following key ARISTOTLE baseline characteristics:

*   Age
*   Sex
*   Congestive heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction
*   Hypertension requiring treatment
*   Diabetes mellitus
*   Prior stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/SE
*   Level of renal impairment
*   Prior VKA/warfarin exposure

To characterise the baseline patient characteristics of ARISTOTLE, we used the key publication of the trial results \[[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref007)\], discussion of trial results by regulatory bodies \[[8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref008),[9](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref009),[16](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref016)\], and publications on the trial presenting cross-tabulations on key characteristics \[[17](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref017),[18](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref018)\].

An ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort of CPRD Aurum apixaban patients was then selected using a modified form of coarsened exact matching \[[19](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref019)\] (see [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) for details).

#### Step 3: Matching of apixaban trial-analogous patients to warfarin trial-eligible patients in CPRD.

To emulate ARISTOTLE, which stratified randomisation on prior VKA exposure status, patients in the CPRD cohort were matched separately within the VKA-naïve and VKA-experienced strata. A 3-step procedure, based on methods proposed by Suissa and colleagues \[[20](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref020)\] and Webster-Clark and colleagues \[[21](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref021)\], was used to select and match patients in the VKA-experienced strata while avoiding selection bias; this procedure is summarised in [Fig 1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g001) and described in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003).

[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377.g001](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377.g001)

The trial-analogous CPRD Aurum apixaban patients were matched to warfarin CPRD Aurum patients using greedy nearest-neighbour matching on the logit of the PS; a caliper of 0.2 times the standard deviation of the logit of the PS was used for matching as recommended by Austin \[[22](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref022)\].

The covariates included in the PS models are detailed in [Table 1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t001).

The model resulting in the most balanced cohort was chosen with balance assessed by looking at standardised differences across all variables after matching using a target threshold of 0.05 for the maximum difference allowed for any individual variable. Balance of covariates considered to be most important in predicting outcome were prioritised, namely, age, sex, and stroke risk factors.

### Exposures and outcomes

#### Exposures.

Exposure to apixaban (5 mg/2.5 mg) or warfarin was determined using CPRD prescribing records with no restrictions on the dose prescribed.

#### Outcomes.

The primary effectiveness outcome was the composite of stroke (ischemic or haemorrhagic) or SE; individual components of this outcome (stroke, ischemic or uncertain type of stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, SE) and death from any cause were the key secondary effectiveness outcomes. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, and composite endpoints of effectiveness outcomes. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding (including by location—intracranial, gastrointestinal, or other location such as urinary or gynaecological). All outcomes involved hospitalisation or death and were ascertained using HES and ONS data. The ICD-10 codes used in ascertaining stroke occurrence have been recommended as having high positive predictive value \[[23](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref023)\].

### Statistical analysis

#### Methods of analysis.

A prospective protocol was published prior to the analysis detailing the planned analyses (\[[14](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref014)\]; also in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)).

Changes from the planned protocol are described in [Table 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t002).

All time-to-event endpoints were analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by prior VKA status (experienced, naïve). The effectiveness outcomes were analysed using the intention-to-treat principle, and major bleeding was analysed using an on-treatment censoring scheme. Patients were censored at 2.5 years after index date reflecting typical maximum duration of follow-up in ARISTOTLE. Cluster-robust standard errors were used with pair membership as the clustering variable \[[24](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref024),[25](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref025)\]. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed by looking at the log-log of the Kaplan–Meier survival curves and inspection of scaled Schoenfeld residuals plotted against time. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 and R version 4.2.1.

#### Supplementary analyses.

A protocol planned analysis in the subset of patients deemed adherent (with adherence measured by TTR in the warfarin users and by proportion of days covered by prescriptions in the apixaban users) was planned to assess the impact of adherence on outcomes. The planned analysis was not possible due to the apixaban prescription data not providing a useful measure of adherence. An analysis by INR TTR was performed instead to assess the impact of warfarin control on results with all outcomes analysed by TTR (TTR < 0.75 and TTR ≥ 0.75). Individual predicted TTR based on baseline variables was used for patients missing TTR. In order to perform the TTR analysis while maintaining balance in the baseline covariates, inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to rebalance the baseline characteristics, applying stabilised weights to the ARISTOTLE-analogous apixaban users. A similar approach to the main analysis was used with PS models constructed separately for the new users and warfarin-experienced users.

An additional post hoc analysis was performed looking at the proportion of apixaban patients prescribed reduced-dose apixaban along with a comparison of the patients meeting the criteria for dose-reduction against the dose actually prescribed. In this analysis, apixaban dose in the ARISTOTLE-analogous CPRD cohort was assessed and compared against the ARISTOTLE protocol-specified criteria and NICE criteria for reduced apixaban dose. ARISTOTLE specified that participants meeting any 2 of the following criteria assessed at the time of randomisation should have their apixaban dose reduced to 2.5 mg BID: age ≥80 years, body weight ≤60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL. These criteria are equivalent to the NICE guidelines for dose reduction with NICE having an additional criteria indicating reduced dose in those with creatinine clearance 15 to 29 mL/minute.

In addition, to assess the impact of the quality of dose-adjustment in the CPRD cohort on the observed effectiveness of apixaban relative to warfarin, a supplementary post hoc analysis was performed looking at the results in the subset of apixaban patients prescribed the correct dose compared with IPTW rebalanced warfarin comparators.

#### Sensitivity analyses.

Primary and secondary effectiveness outcomes were also analysed using the on-treatment censoring scheme to investigate whether treatment discontinuation compromises confidence in the effectiveness analyses.

Treatment persistence was defined by looking at longitudinal prescription data for OACs; OAC treatment windows were derived in which gaps > = 6 months between prescription dates were considered as distinct treatment windows. The end of each OAC treatment window was derived as the date of the last prescription of index OAC + the number of days supply given in the last prescription + a grace period of 30 days. In cases of overlapping OAC treatment windows, the date of the first prescription of the subsequent OAC treatment window was used to define the end of the prior OAC window. A prescription for a different OAC from the index OAC treatment was considered as a treatment switch. An ending of index OAC treatment with no subsequent prescription for any other OAC recorded was considered as treatment stop. Gaps of > = 6 months with no subsequent OAC prescriptions recorded were categorised as having stopped OAC treatment.

The set of patients who switched or discontinued treatment during follow-up were examined to ascertain whether selection bias due to attrition may have affected the on-treatment analyses (Table A9 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)).

Apixaban was first launched for AF in the UK in January 2013, with relatively few patients receiving a prescription in the first year it was available; we therefore performed a sensitivity analysis with the start of study period shifted forwards a year to investigate the impact of inclusion of early adopters who may differ from later adopters of a new drug.

#### Confounding and bias.

In the study period, apixaban was a newly available treatment leading to the possibility of channelling bias \[[26](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref026)\]. By applying trial eligibility criteria to both treatment cohorts and matching using baseline covariates, we aimed to minimise channelling bias. To handle confounding, treatment arms were matched using propensity score matching (PSM) \[[27](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref027)\].

#### Benchmarking results against ARISTOTLE.

The study hypothesis was that results in the CPRD ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort would be comparable to the ARISTOTLE results, as defined by the prespecified benchmarking criteria. A slightly weaker benefit of apixaban versus warfarin was expected based on the weaker benefit seen in the EU subgroup of ARISTOTLE, and an expectation that the quality of warfarin control in UK patients may be higher than that observed in ARISTOTLE.

The benchmarking criteria for considering the results in the trial-analogous CPRD cohort to be comparable with ARISTOTLE were prespecified and published previously \[[14](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref014)\]:

*   The effect size must be clinically comparable with the ARISTOTLE findings; the HR for time to stroke/SE with the HR must be between 0.69 and 0.99. This range is not symmetrical around the ARISTOTLE estimate of 0.79 as it is anticipated the treatment effect in routine clinical care may be weaker than that seen in the optimised setting of a clinical trial.
*   The upper limit of the 95% CI for the HR for time to stroke/SE must be less than 1.38 (noninferiority margin used in ARISTOTLE, updated since protocol—see [Table 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t002)).

The benchmarking step applied only to the primary effectiveness outcome in the trial-analogous CPRD cohort; results in other groups such as patients underrepresented or excluded from the trial would not necessarily be expected to remain consistent to the RCT results, given the relative risks may differ in these groups. Comparability of other outcomes was to be assessed descriptively with no formal criteria or hypothesis testing used.

### Missing data

Patients with missing systolic blood pressure (0.1%), body mass index (3.3%), smoking status (0.1%), or socioeconomic status (0.1%) were excluded from the trial-eligible cohort as the proportion of patients with these missing was low. Patients with missing renal function (1.3%), ethnicity (0.4%), or alcohol use (5.6%) were kept in the cohort through a missing indicator approach; this approach is valid under the assumption that these variables act as confounders and influence clinician prescribing decisions only when observed \[[28](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref028)\]. A total of 1,176 (13.3%) warfarin users in the CPRD cohort did not have INR measurements in the data during their treatment period with predicted TTR used for these patients in the analysis by TTR (see [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) for details).

### Ethics

Scientific approval was provided by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine research ethics committee (ref 17682) and the independent scientific advisory committee of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (protocol no. 19\_066R). CPRD data are already approved via a national research ethics committee for purely noninterventional research of this type. CPRD data are analysed anonmymously; therefore, individual patient consent is not sought by contributing medical practices when data are shared with CPRD; however, patients are able to opt out of their patient information being shared for research.

### Participants

Between 1 January 2013 and 31 July 2019, there were 86,888 people with AF prescribed apixaban and 159,632 prescribed warfarin in HES-linked CPRD Aurum practices ([Fig 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g002)). Application of minimum registration period and ARISTOTLE inclusion criteria reduced this to 67,539 apixaban and 139,527 warfarin patients. After applying ARISTOTLE exclusion criteria, there were 41,487 apixaban and 101,159 warfarin patients.

See Table A1 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) for detailed list of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Note: For prevalent warfarin users, trial eligibility only revealed at point of random selection into the cohort for prevalent users. Numbers in figure show maximum theoretical number of warfarin users available should they be selected only at a time they were eligible for the trial.

[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377.g002](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377.g002)

Selecting apixaban patients to match ARISTOTLE on key baseline characteristics yielded 9,120 apixaban patients (3,912 new users and 5,208 prevalent users) available for PSM to 101,159 warfarin patients. For 274 apixaban patients, no match could be found giving a PS matched cohort of 8,846 apixaban and 8,846 warfarin patients.

### Application of ARISTOTLE inclusion/exclusion criteria and matching to ARISTOTLE

Applying the ARISTOTLE inclusion/exclusion criteria and matching to ARISTOTLE baseline patient characteristics resulted in a cohort similar to the ARISTOTLE apixaban participants ([Table 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t003)); for example, median age was 78 and mean CHADS2 score 2.4 in CPRD Aurum before applying trial criteria and matching, whereas the median age of 71 and mean CHADS2 score 2.1 after these steps matched the ARISTOTLE apixaban participants. The ARISTOTLE-analogous apixaban arm matched the trial arm on prior VKA exposure, age, sex, stroke risk factors and CHADS2 score, and proportion of patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.

[![Image 4: thumbnail](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/figure/image?size=inline&id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377.t003)](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/figure/image?size=medium&id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377.t003 ""Click for larger image"")

Table 3. Baseline characteristics of patients with AF prescribed apixaban and warfarin in CPRD Aurum compared with ARISTOTLE participants: (i) before and (ii) after applying ARISTOTLE inclusion and exclusion criteria and (iii) after matching to the trial participants.

Differences remained on baseline characteristics it was not feasible to match on, namely, ethnicity (95.2% white, 2.4% Asian in CPRD Aurum apixaban versus 82.6% white, 14.4% Asian in ARISTOTLE) and concomitant medications (amiodarone 3.8%, aspirin 5.8%, digoxin 13.9% in CPRD Aurum apixaban users versus amiodarone 11.1%, aspirin 31.3%, digoxin 32.0% in ARISTOTLE apixaban arm). See [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) for details on matching feasibility.

### Propensity score matching of CPRD Aurum trial-analogous apixaban users to CPRD Aurum warfarin users

#### Results of propensity score matching.

Before PSM, differences between treatment groups were evident for most baseline variables including age (median age 71 in apixaban versus 78 in warfarin), sex (apixaban 35.6% female versus warfarin 43.6%), and stroke risk factors (see [Table 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t003)). After PSM, all baseline characteristics were well balanced (maximum standardised difference .031). From 9,120 apixaban users, only 274 (3.0%) were dropped due to unsuccessful matching.

### Main results

The HR for stroke/SE in the PS matched groups was 0.98 (95% CI 0.82,1.19) ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003) and Table A3 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)). This association was consistent with the noninferiority margin (upper limit of the 95% CI less than 1.38) \[[7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref007)\] but did not show superiority as predicted by ARISTOTLE \[HR 0.79 (95% CI 0.66,0.95)\] ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003) and Table A2 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)). The outcome of all-cause mortality also showed noninferiority \[Aurum 1.03 (0.93,1.14) versus trial 0.89 (0.80,0.998)\] but did not indicate apixaban superiority. Absolute event rates for the primary outcome and components were close to the trial for apixaban—for example \[comparing Aurum versus trial\], stroke/SE event rate of 1.27%/year versus 1.27%, whereas the warfarin group had a lower event rate compared with ARISTOTLE (stroke/SE event rate of 1.29%/year versus 1.60% and hemorrhagic stroke 0.33%/year versus 0.47%/year) ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003)). Mean duration of follow-up in the cohort was 1.8 years in the apixaban arm and 2.2 years in the warfarin arm.

### Analysis of impact of warfarin time in therapeutic range (TTR)

TTR was higher in the CPRD cohort than in ARISTOTLE (mean 0.73 versus 0.62, median 0.76 versus 0.66).

Analysis by TTR suggested noninferiority of apixaban versus warfarin in those with TTR < 0.75 \[stroke/SE 0.91 (0.73,1.14), all-cause death 0.94 (0.84, 1.06)\] ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003)). Apixaban was associated with similar hazards for stroke by category of TTR and increased hazards of death compared to warfarin in those with well-controlled warfarin treatment (TTR ≥ 0.75) \[stroke/SE 1.05 (0.82, 1.34), all-cause death 1.20 (1.04, 1.37)\] ([Fig 3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g003)).

### Analysis of apixaban dose-adjustment

The proportion of patients meeting the criteria for reduced dose apixaban ([Table 4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t004)) was similar between the CPRD ARISTOTLE-analogous apixaban, warfarin, and RCT apixaban groups (4.9%, 4.9%, and 4.7%, respectively). When including the additional NICE criteria of creatinine clearance, 5.1% of apixaban users in the ARISTOTLE-analogous cohort had an indication for reduced-dose apixaban, yet a larger proportion (14.3%) were prescribed reduced dose apixaban implying some patients in CPRD Aurum may have been prescribed the wrong dose and/or information on criteria for dose reduction may have been missing from CPRD Aurum.

A futher analysis of the quality of dose-adjustment in patients in CPRD Aurum ([Table 5](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-t005)) indicated 10.5% of patients may have been prescribed an incorrect dose of apixaban at the index prescription based on the data contained in their electronic health records (EHRs). The majority of incorrect dose relating to patients being prescribed reduced-dose apixaban despite not meeting the criteria for dose reduction. A large proportion of patients prescribed an incorrect dose had only 1 dose adjustment criteria (59.6% of those with incorrect dose), suggesting some prescribers may have thought a dose reduction was warranted when only 1 criteria was present. Other possible reasons for the incorrect dose-adjustment observed here may be data on the criteria missing from the EHR (i.e., incorrect ascertainment) or consideration of other medical history that made a prescriber adjust the dose.

To assess the impact of the quality of dose-adjustment in the CPRD cohort on the effectiveness of apixaban, a supplementary post hoc analysis was performed looking at the results in the subset of apixaban patients prescribed the correct dose (_N_ = 7,921) compared with IPTW rebalanced warfarin comparators. The results in this subset were consistent with the primary results showing apixaban to be noninferior to warfarin (stroke/SE 0.96 \[0.78,1.17\], death 0.97 \[0.87,1.09\]) with the results moving slightly closer to those observed in ARISTOTLE.

### Safety results

The analysis for safety outcomes is presented in [Fig 4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g004) and Table A5 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003); patients on apixaban had a lower risk of major bleeding compared with those on warfarin, HR (95% CI) 0.88 (0.77,1.00), consistent with ARISTOTLE. Analysis by TTR suggested superiority of apixaban for major bleeding in those with TTR <0.75 \[0.74 (0.63, 0.86)\], whereas apixaban users had a similar risk of major bleeding compared with those with optimal warfarin control (TTR ≥ 0.75) \[1.08 (0.90,1.30)\].

### Sensitivity analyses

Table A7 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003) shows the proportion of patients switching treatment. A higher proportion of patients on warfarin switched to an alternative OAC during follow-up compared with those on apixaban (16.3% versus 6.1%).

Comparing patients who switched treatment during follow-up with those that continued on index treatment (Table A8 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)) suggests possible selection bias due to attrition in on-treatment analyses with median TTR markedly lower in warfarin users who switched treatments compared with persistent warfarin users (median TTR 0.64 versus 0.78). On-treatment analyses would likely be biased against apixaban since patients doing badly on warfarin (i.e., with low TTR) who would be more likely to experience events in the warfarin arm would be censored at treatment switch.

On-treatment analyses censoring around treatment switch or discontinuation are presented for the effectiveness analyses in the appendix (Table A6 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)); the results show evidence of the expected attrition bias against apixaban when compared with the ITT results in [Fig 2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed-1004377-g002), for example, HR for stroke/SE is 1.04 (0.86, 1.25) in the on-treatment compared with 0.98 (95% CI 0.82, 1.19) in the ITT analysis.

Repeating the analysis with start of study period shifted forwards a year to investigate the impact of inclusion of early adopters yielded similar results to the primary analysis (Table A9 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003)).

Prior INR control was not included in the PS models for the VKA-experienced due to a high rate of missing prior INR data (missing for 34% in the apixaban arm). A post hoc sensitivity analysis including a prior INR control variable in the PSM gave results consistent with the primary results \[stroke/SE HR 95% CI 1.02 (0.86,1.21)\]. Details of this post hoc analysis are in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003).

Discussion
----------

In our emulation of ARISTOTLE using UK routinely collected healthcare data, we found results that met our predefined criteria for comparability with the trial. We saw noninferiority of apixaban versus warfarin for prevention of stroke or SE, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding but did not see superiority of apixaban versus warfarin for these outcomes as was seen in ARISTOTLE. We found higher TTR in the patients using warfarin in our cohort compared with the warfarin arm of ARISTOTLE (median 0.76 versus 0.66). While our analysis by TTR showed noninferiority of apixaban versus warfarin for our stroke or SE outcome, we observed an increased risk of death on apixaban compared with patients well-controlled on warfarin (TTR ≥ 0.75) but not when compared with those on poorly controlled warfarin (TTR < 0.75). For major bleeding, while apixaban was superior when compared to those on poorly controlled warfarin, there was no difference when compared to those on well-controlled warfarin. We saw evidence suggesting suboptimal dosing of apixaban in our cohort with approximately 10% of patients in the apixaban arm prescribed the reduced dose without meeting the criteria for the reduced dose.

We found the differences in the overall treatment-effect estimates between our cohort and ARISTOTLE may be explained by the lower proportion of Asian patients in our cohort, differences in INR control in the warfarin arm of our cohort compared with ARISTOTLE, and the higher proportion of patients prescribed a reduced dose of apixaban in our cohort compared with ARISTOTLE.

Our findings are consistent with a UK study of ischemic stroke, which compared DOACs with warfarin \[[29](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref029)\]. A Danish study found similar results to ours for stroke/SE \[[30](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref030)\], although they found apixaban users had a lower risk of death; a study of US claims data \[[31](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref031)\] also found apixaban was associated with a lower risk of death. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 studies \[[32](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref032)\] found pooled results for stroke and intracranial haemorrhage that were consistent with ours. One study (in US claims data) also aimed to replicate ARISTOTLE \[[33](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref033),[34](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref034)\] and, in contrast to our study, found superiority for apixaban for stroke/SE, which may be linked to population differences such as lower TTR in US patients on warfarin \[[35](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref035)\] and differences in ethnicity. None of these studies matched to the ARISTOTLE trial participants, included prevalent users, or looked at how warfarin control impacted results. Further details on these studies including design and key results are summarised in Table A10 in [S1 Appendix](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.s003).

A key strength of our study was the use of a framework that sampled prevalent users (the continuing users of warfarin in this study) in a way that avoided selection bias facilitating the construction of a cohort of patients similar to the target trial population, which included both new users of apixaban and warfarin (VKA-naïve) and patients with prior VKA exposure (VKA-experienced) that were randomised to stay on warfarin or switch to apixaban. The use of PSM, stratified by treatment history, enabled us to select a matched cohort well balanced on important covariates. The successful emulation of ARISTOTLE by our study shows that valid treatment effects can be obtained for important outcomes with OACs using noninterventional methods with routinely collected clinical data. Having validated this framework, in future studies, we can look at the effectiveness of OACs in AF patient groups not included or underrepresented in the RCT, such as elderly patients and those at increased bleeding risk. We also recommend future analyses with an extended follow-up period compared with this study to compare the long-term outcomes seen in the noninterventional cohort with projected long-term outcomes from the RCT.

An additional strength of our study was the ability to explore the quality of warfarin treatment in our cohort and the impact of INR control on the treatment effect estimates. Our finding that the benefits of apixaban versus warfarin for some outcomes depended on the quality of INR control in the warfarin arm answers questions raised in the NICE premeeting briefing, which looked at apixaban in the NVAF population and noted the TTR seen in ARISTOTLE “may be lower than what is typical in UK clinical practice” and “apixaban compared with well-controlled warfarin (TTR 75% or more) may not be superior in the long term” \[[8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref008)\]. ARISTOTLE presented outcomes by centre (for example, hospital) TTR quartile and did not show a signal of treatment efficacy differing by centre TTR quartile. We were able to use IPTW to estimate the treatment effect in the different warfarin TTR groups and used predicted TTR for warfarin users missing TTR to attempt to limite the risk of selection bias.

While our study aimed to emulate ARISTOTLE using suitable methods, there were several limitations. Some of the criteria assessed for ARISTOTLE eligibility may not be well recorded in CPRD leading to a risk of misclassification. Furthermore, misclassification of ARISTOTLE eligibility criteria and baseline covariates could be differential by treatment in the VKA-experienced patients if criteria such as renal function are more likely to be checked before changing treatment. However, the most important risk factors for the primary outcome of stroke (the components of CHA2DS2\-VASc stroke risk score) are mostly well recorded in CPRD Aurum and HES.

Our cohort did not attempt to match the trial on the use of concomitant medications in order for our cohort to reflect typical UK prescribing. In ARISTOTLE, 31% of participants were using aspirin and 11% using amiodarone at baseline, whereas in our cohort, only 6% were recorded as using aspirin and 4% amiodarone. Amiodarone potentiates the effects of warfarin, and concomitant use of amiodarone with DOACs is associated with increased risk of major bleeding \[[36](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref036)\], while concomitant use of aspirin increases the risk of bleeding for both warfarin \[[37](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref037)\] and DOACs \[[38](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref038)\]. The difference in concomitant medication usage between our cohort and the trial population may explain some of the observed differences in treatment effects.

A key limitation of our study was the inability to match ARISOTLE on ethnicity, meaning the CPRD Aurum cohort included a low number of patients from Asian and Hispanic groups when compared with the RCT (14.5% of participants in ARISTOTLE were Asian compared to 2.4% in our ARISTOTLE-analogous CPRD cohort). There are known racial differences in the treatment effects of OACs with Asian patients experiencing a higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage compared with white patients; in ARISTOTLE, Asian participants experienced double the risk of stroke or SE when on warfarin therapy when compared with white participants \[[39](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref039)\]. The reasons for the increased risk of bleeding associated with warfarin therapy in Asian patients is hypothesised to be associated with differences in drug metabolism and prevelance of cerebral microbleeds \[[40](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref040)\]. The difference in proportion of Asian patients between our cohort and ARISTOTLE is therefore likely to explain some of the differences in treatment effects seen and limits the generalisability of our study, with the results of our study of most relevanance to white patients. This limitation on ethnicity arose from the data source used and time period studied (patients with AF in CPRD Aurum 2013–2019), which had a low proportion of Asian patients, likely due to AF being associated with older age combined with a lower prevalence of AF in Asian patients compared with white patients \[[41](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref041)\]. While CPRD Aurum is largely representative of the UK population in relation to ethnicity \[[42](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref042)\], diversity is still limited for older individuals. Despite this, CPRD Aurum has shown to be a useful resource for investigating treatment effects in different ethnic groups for indications such as hypertension, which is more prevalent and occurs at a younger age in ethnic minority groups, with similar trial replication methods used to compare antihypertensive treatment effects in underrepresented ethnic groups \[[13](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref013)\].

The approach our study used for handling missing data on baseline covariates relied on assumptions on the relationship between missingness, treatment, and outcomes, which may not be valid; however, the low proportion of missing data means that this is unlikely to have impacted the results. In the coarsened exact matching step, the choice of variables will have an impact on the resulting cohort selected, meaning a different combination of variables could lead to different results. There is a risk that residual confounding may be present despite the use of PSM. The use of PSM also has the potential to introduce bias by dropping patients from the cohort \[[19](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref019)\]; however, PSM is well suited to the process of trial emulation including prevalent users, and a low number of apixaban users were dropped due to unsuccessful matching. The inclusion of prevalent users of warfarin in the cohort risks the introduction of selection bias \[[20](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref020),[21](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref021)\]; this was avoided by use of a method shown to produce unbiased estimates in a simulation study \[[21](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref021)\]. We found consistent results between our new and prevalent user strata across multiple outcomes providing reassurance the method used was likely to have successfully avoided selection bias.

Apixaban along with other DOACs were rapidly adopted as preferred first-line OAC in AF during the study period; it was therefore not possible to match on calendar date leading to a difference in follow-up time between the treatment arms in our cohort. A higher proportion of warfarin users switched to alternative OAC during follow-up compared with those prescribed apixaban (16% versus 6%). The impact of this differential switching during follow-up was addressed in the sensitivity analyses. The availability of new alternative treatments during the study period also means there is a risk of channelling bias in that over time the patients still on warfarin are more likely to be those doing well on warfarin. INR control prior to the index date was not included in the PS for the prevalent users due to a high rate of missing data; however, other variables associated with poor INR control were included in the models, and an exploratory post hoc analysis including a variable for poor INR control gave results consistent with the primary results.

Adherence to treatment was difficult to assess in our study due to automatic repeat prescriptions; treatment persistence was more useful in providing a measure of pattern of medicine use over time. In the analysis by TTR, the adherence of patients using apixaban was not accounted for; however, a previous UK study showed apixaban had higher adherence than VKAs \[[43](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004377#pmed.1004377.ref043)\], meaning we would expect to see better effectiveness outcomes in apixaban. Futhermore, the use of IPTW in the analysis by TTR means predictors of poor adherence are likely to have been balanced between treatments. The analysis of TTR is limited by this being a post-baseline measure available for only 1 treatment arm leading to a risk of selection bias in this analysis—patients with TTR available in the study may be more healthy than those without this measure given that patients have to survive and not be hospitalised to have INR measurements available in CPRD Aurum. The limitation of use of a post-baseline measurement available for 1 treatment arm was also evident in the RCTs of DOACs versus warfarin and is mitigated in our study through the use of IPTW and predicted TTR for patients that were missing TTR (using a model to predict TTR that used INR measurements restricted to the first year of follow-up). Given the risk of selection bias in the analysis by TTR and risk of misclassification of TTR for those missing TTR, these results should be considered exploratory and interpreted with caution. Sensitivity analyses in our cohort using an on-treatment censoring scheme showed evidence of attrition bias. The regular measurement of INR and availability of alternative anticoagulants makes warfarin therapy particularly prone to attrition bias since a patient may be more likely to switch to a DOAC if their INR is frequently out of the optimal range or if they have not been adhering to scheduled INR testing.

To conclude, we found that applying a reference trial emulation approach allowed us to emulate a landmark randomised trial of apixaban versus warfarin using UK noninterventional data, with results meeting prespecified benchmarking criteria based on the reference trial results. This trial emulation method provides valid treatment effect estimates for apixaban compared to warfarin and can be used to determine risks and benefits of AF medications in people treated in routine clinical care. This study demonstrates a successful real-world application of novel methods that have been proposed for the inclusion of prevalent users in observational studies, with the application of an adaptation to mimic the screening process making the method suitable for emulation of RCTs that include prevalent users. These methods could be adapted for emulation of RCTs in other therapeutic areas and for looking at patient groups underrepresented or excluded from RCTs.

The weaker overall treatment benefit observed in our cohort appears to be due to a higher proportion of patients with well-controlled warfarin in the UK clinical context, compared with the trial. Our exploratory analysis by TTR showed similar results for stroke and a greater benefit for apixaban for major bleeding compared with TTR <0.75; conversely, a slightly higher risk of death was observed on apixaban compared with well-controlled warfarin.

A recent multinational, double-blind trial published in the *New England Journal of Medicine* has revealed that intravenous amino acids significantly lower the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The study involved over 3,500 patients, showing a reduction in AKI occurrences from 31.7% in the placebo group to 26.9% in the amino acid group (P=0.002). This is a substantial finding for cardiac surgeons and anesthesiologists aiming to enhance patient outcomes in high-risk surgical environments.

Abstract
--------

### Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious and common complication of cardiac surgery, for which reduced kidney perfusion is a key contributing factor. Intravenous amino acids increase kidney perfusion and recruit renal functional reserve. However, the efficacy of amino acids in reducing the occurrence of AKI after cardiac surgery is uncertain.

### Methods

In a multinational, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned adult patients who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass to receive an intravenous infusion of either a balanced mixture of amino acids, at a dose of 2 g per kilogram of ideal body weight per day, or placebo (Ringer’s solution) for up to 3 days. The primary outcome was the occurrence of AKI, defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes creatinine criteria. Secondary outcomes included the severity of AKI, the use and duration of kidney-replacement therapy, and all-cause 30-day mortality.

### Results

We recruited 3511 patients at 22 centers in three countries and assigned 1759 patients to the amino acid group and 1752 to the placebo group. AKI occurred in 474 patients (26.9%) in the amino acid group and in 555 (31.7%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.77 to 0.94; P=0.002). Stage 3 AKI occurred in 29 patients (1.6%) and 52 patients (3.0%), respectively (relative risk, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.87). Kidney-replacement therapy was used in 24 patients (1.4%) in the amino acid group and in 33 patients (1.9%) in the placebo group. There were no substantial differences between the two groups in other secondary outcomes or in adverse events.

[Markus Weingarth](https://www.weingarth-group.net/), a biochemist at Utrecht University, considers lipid II, a building block of bacteria cell walls, one of the most promising antibiotic targets. Human cells don’t produce it — so targeting it avoids toxicity — and bacteria struggle to develop resistance against it.

His research group recently published a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01696-9) in _Nature Microbiology_, in which they reported that the antibiotic plectasin binds lipid II by forming dense structures on bacterial membranes (1). The findings improve researchers’ understanding of how lipid II binding disrupts the cell walls of bacteria, which can help them develop better antibiotics.

Novozyme’s scientists first [described](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1185723?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) plectasin’s mechanism of action in 2010 (2). However, in their experiments, they used artificial membranes called micelles and showed that each plectasin molecule paired with one lipid II molecule. However, micelles do not accurately mimic the membrane environment. “We took a gamble, believing that what happened in micelles was not the real deal, and this turned out to be the case,” said Weingarth. In biological membranes, the team found that plectasin formed massive supramolecular structures upon lipid II binding. “We saw that the supramolecular mechanism was not the exception, but rather the rule among the lipid II binders.”

**How is plectasin’s mechanism of action different from that of other antibiotics?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conventional antimicrobial peptides selectively bind bacteria based on electrostatics, as bacterial membranes are negatively charged while human cell membranes are positively charged. This electrostatic interaction is fairly unspecific. However, plectasin targets lipid II specifically based on both structure and charge, making it a highly selective target binder. This specificity marks its first major difference. Most drugs follow a conventional ""one drug, one target"" mechanism, where the drug and the target interact directly. In contrast, plectasin and other lipid II binders form massive supramolecular structures upon target binding. This formation is not just a feature but a critical aspect of the mechanism. Without these superstructures, there would be no stable target binding. These two prominent features of plectasin — highly specific interaction with the target and supramolecular recognition — distinguish it from conventional antimicrobial peptides.

The other thing that stands out about plectasin’s mechanism is that it is calcium modulated, which was an unexpected discovery. In hindsight, it seems obvious given the presence of a large ionic pocket that naturally binds calcium. However, this aspect had not been mentioned in any previous publications on plectasin.

**What makes lipid II a good antibiotic target?**
-------------------------------------------------

Lipid II has fatty acid tails and a pyrophosphate head group, which bacteria cannot alter. There are no known cases of bacteria replacing the pyrophosphate group for peptidoglycan synthesis, making it an absolute bottleneck for their cell wall biosynthesis. However, bacteria might be able to develop indirect resistance mechanisms, such as making the target inaccessible. They could make the peptidoglycan layer so dense that the drug never reaches the target. This is energy-intensive and unstable. Additionally, bacteria cannot make more lipid II once it’s captured, so targeting lipid II at these immutable sites makes it difficult for bacteria to develop stable resistance mechanisms.

> We saw that the supramolecular mechanism was not the exception, but rather the rule among the lipid II binders.   
> – Markus Weingarth, Utrecht University

**How effective is plectasin as an antibiotic?**
------------------------------------------------

Plectasin is not effective against gram-negative bacteria because it cannot overcome their outer membrane. However, plectasin is highly efficient against gram-positive bacteria and maintains this effectiveness in animal models of infection. Despite its potential as a relevant therapeutic, I am pessimistic about its future because the clinical development of plectasin was discontinued, and the work was never published. However, plectasin ticks many important boxes: It is stable in serum, non-cytotoxic, and highly efficient against a broad range of superbugs, including in animal models of infection, making it a compelling clinical candidate.

Although plectasin’s future as a therapeutic is uncertain, the study’s findings have significant implications for the design of lipid II-binding antibiotics. It’s crucial to optimize both the part of the drug that binds the target and the part responsible for oligomerization. This aspect has been ignored so far, as the focus has traditionally been on target binding alone. However, target binding and oligomerization are strongly interdependent. Only when both are optimized can ideal target binding occur.

Markdown Content:
Berlin-based Caresyntax, which is building an AI-driven data platform for surgery, has raised a $180m Series C extension.

The round is made up of $80m in equity and $100m in debt — and is tied to specific milestones. The fresh funding tops up the startup’s [$130m Series C,](https://sifted.eu/articles/caresyntax-raises-100m) raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.

It’s the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.

Caresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.

### **AI for hospitals**

Caresyntax says it wants to build the “Android” platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals’ surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.

The company’s platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.

While some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax’s platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.

“Effectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,” they add.

If it does what it sets out to do, it’s a big opportunity.

Costs associated with operations account for [30%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6586534/#:~:text=Older%20estimates%20suggest%20that%20inpatient,healthcare%20costs%20%5B2%203%5D.) of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends [11%](https://www.medtecheurope.org/datahub/expenditure/#:~:text=In%20Europe%2C%20an%20average%20of,less%20than%201%25%20of%20GDP.) of GDP on health.

Founded in 2013 in Germany — Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 — its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company’s revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.

### **The rise of smart surgery**

The round comes on the back of a strong 18 months for startups developing tech for the operating theatre.

Since the start of 2023, three of the four biggest medtech raises have all gone to startups building robots to help surgeons. The UK’s CMR Surgical picked up [£165m](https://sifted.eu/articles/cmr-surgical-raise-2023) in September last year, Switzerland’s DistalMotion $150m in April 2023 and Italy’s Medical Microinstruments $110m in February this year.

Investors in Caresyntax’s round include Symbiotic Capital, MTIP AG, BIONIQ Capital, PFM Health Sciences, Pictet Alternative Advisors, surgical.ai, BlackRock Innovation Capital, Aescuvest, Optum Ventures, Cure Capital, Relyens Group, Vesalius Biocapital, Lauxera Capital, Plug & Play Growth Fund and ProAssurance Corp.

URL Source: https://sifted.eu/articles/flo-health-unicorn-raise-news/

Markdown Content:
UK femtech Flo Health is set to raise more than $200m in equity from US growth investor General Atlantic — a backer of companies like Uber and Airbnb.

The period-tracking app’s Series C is the joint-biggest ever raise for a femtech — along with US fertility startup Prelude Fertility — according to data platform Dealroom. It also gives Europe its first femtech unicorn and takes Flo’s total funding to more than $290m.

All the funds have been committed and a stock purchase agreement has been signed, cofounder and CEO Dmitry Gurski tells Sifted. The funding round is expected to close in coming weeks, subject to regulatory approvals.

Flo will use the funds to expand into new user segments like perimenopause and menopause and invest in R&D for AI-driven personalised insights tools.

### **Europe’s first femtech unicorn**

While in the US just a few femtechs have hit unicorn status — including fertility clinics Maven and Kindbody — in Europe the sector’s unicorn stable has been bare until now. Previously, the largest raise by a femtech startup was [Elvie’s](https://sifted.eu/articles/elvie-uk-healthtech-raise) £70m Series C, picked up across two rounds in 2021.

Flo isn’t disclosing what its exact valuation will be when the funds hit its account, but Gurski tells Sifted the company hit a pre-money valuation of $1bn. ""Reaching unicorn status is a significant milestone for Flo and the entire femtech industry,"" he says.

It comes after a challenging time in the market across the last couple years, says Gurski. “But despite everything, Flo has shown steady, significant growth, after more than eight years of continuous expansion.”

Flo’s revenue in 2023 was $112m — up from $35m in 2022, according to the company’s latest annual accounts. Losses over the same period fell from $35m to $25m. The company has just under 500 employees globally, Gurski tells Sifted.

It plans to deploy some of the fresh capital to increase R&D headcount with “investments in top-tier talent across \[our\] global offices in Europe and North America,” Gurski says.

On longer-term plans, he tells Sifted that, “while we're not announcing specific IPO plans at this time, this funding broadens our range of future paths and gives us the flexibility to choose the best path forward for Flo's continued success and impact in the women's health space.” Gurski adds: “Our immediate focus remains on executing our growth strategy and further solidifying our position as a leader in femtech.”

### **The most downloaded women’s health app**

Flo was founded in 2015 — a year before the term “femtech” was first coined by Ida Tin, founder of soon-to-be rival period tracking app Clue. It’s since grown into the most-downloaded women’s health app on both Google Play and AppStore, according to market insights platform Sensor Tower.

Flo’s platform allows users to track their period cycle and monitor symptoms, as well as providing them with tailored health insights and educational content.

The startup says it has 70m monthly active users and close to 5m paid subscribers as of June 2024. About 50% of those are based in the US, with the remaining half split evenly between the UK and EU.

### **Historically underfunded**

Femtech has long been considered an underfunded sector. In 2023 European startups raised just $191m, a fraction of the $9.7bn shelled out on the wider healthtech sector. On top of that funding in the wider digital health sector — which encompasses the vast majority of femtechs — has been [hit hard](https://sifted.eu/articles/digital-health-startups-are-running-out-of-cash) by the downturn.

But despite that, Flo isn’t the only femtech that’s raised a sizeable sum in 2024. In May, Swedish digital birth control startup Natural Cycles picked up $55m, one of the largest European digital health rounds of the year.

Others haven’t been so fortunate. At the start of 2023, Clue announced it was [making layoffs](https://sifted.eu/articles/brainly-clue-aiven-tech-layoffs-arent-over-in-2023) and audio erotica site Emjoy shuttered earlier this year.

Anogenital warts are benign, proliferative growths that can appear anywhere in the genital region.1 In almost all cases, anogenital warts are spread via sexual transmission;1 very rarely, transmission can occur through hand2 or perinatal3 contact. It is important to note that transmission can occur when no warts are visible, and that the time interval between infection and presentation can be highly variable—an average of 3 months for women and 11 months for men.4 There are more than 100 genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV), but over 90% of cases of anogenital warts are caused by ‘low-risk’ HPV (genotypes 6 and 11).4,5

Anogenital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection (STI), with an estimated lifetime risk of 10% for sexually active people.6 They are most common in 20–24-year-olds, but can occur at any age.7 The yearly occurrence of new cases is usually around 50,000 in the UK,1 although cases have dropped to around 27,000 per year since 2020.8 Patients who present with anogenital warts are also at risk of other STIs ; these may be asymptomatic, and could be tested for and treated at the time of presentation.7

Primary care plays an essential role in providing sexual health screening and treatment. Proactive clinicians can reduce barriers to sexual health, normalise STI screening, provide education on safe sex, and open discussions around psychosexual wellbeing.9

The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) published an update to its national guideline for the management of anogenital warts in adults in 2024.1 Although it is primarily aimed at level-3 sexual health clinics, it contains some important updates for primary care.1 This article offers six key learning points from this guideline for primary care practitioners to consider when seeing a patient with suspected anogenital warts.

1\. Examine Suspected Anogenital Warts Carefully, Considering Common Differential Diagnoses 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If anogenital warts are suspected, a brief sexual history should be taken, including consideration of any new sexual partners, number of sexual partners in the last year, and barrier contraception use.1,10

Anogenital warts can generally be diagnosed clinically, via visual inspection under direct illumination.1,4 There will usually be multiple lesions less than 10 mm in size, although these can coalesce to form larger lesions.11 The lesions are often soft and flesh-coloured, but can sometimes be hyperpigmented or keratinised.1,4,6 They are predominantly asymptomatic, but occasionally pain or itching can occur.1,7

For women, a speculum examination is only indicated if warts are present at the vaginal introitus or if there are internal vaginal symptoms such as irritation, bleeding, or discharge.1 For all patients, proctoscopic examination should be performed if there are warts at the anal margin or anal symptoms.1 Patients should be seen in a sexual health centre if this examination cannot be done in primary care.

Differential diagnoses should also be considered when inspecting suspected anogenital warts.1 Key differential diagnoses of anogenital warts are listed in Box 1.1,6,11

| Box 1: Key Differential Diagnoses of Anogenital Warts1,6,11 |
| --- |
| 
*   Pearly penile papules
*   Sebaceous glands of the vulva or foreskin
*   Fordyce spots
*   Epidermoid cysts
*   Skin tags
*   Granuloma annulare
*   Lichen planus
*   Seborrhoeic keratoses
*   Molluscum contagiosum
*   Condylomata lata (lesions found in secondary syphilis)
*   Intraepithelial neoplasia
*   Malignancy
*   Fibroma. 

 |

2\. Manage Anogenital Warts Based on Number of Lesions, Patient Preference, and Recurrence 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not all cases of anogenital warts will require treatment.6,11 This is especially true of smaller, asymptomatic warts, as spontaneous clearance occurs in around 30% of patients within the first 4 months.7 Nevertheless, a variety of treatment options exist, some of which are self-administered and others administered by clinicians.1,4,11 The current evidence on the treatment of anogenital warts is not strong enough for guidance to explicitly recommend one treatment over others; rather, when choosing a treatment option, clinicians should consider patient preference, number of lesions, and response to prior treatments.1,4 See Box 2 for a list of recommended treatment options.1,4,6,11,12

| Box 2: Treatment Options for Anogenital Warts1,4,6,11,12 |

### Local Treatment Pathways 

Choice of treatment will also depend on the skillset present in primary care and local pathways.11 For example, if the correct training and equipment are available for cryotherapy, this treatment can be performed in primary care. To this end, BASHH recommends setting up local treatment pathways in conjunction with nearby level-3 sexual health services, and has provided an example treatment algorithm for these pathways (see Figure 1).1

### Patient Education 

Patients should be informed that the aim of treatment is to reduce the visibility of warts and return to having normal anogenital skin.1 Clinicians should emphasise that treatment does not affect transmission to sexual partners and that sexual transmission to a partner can still happen when there are no visible lesions, and healthcare practitioners must also counsel patients on condom use.1 BASHH recommends signposting patients to its patient information leaflet on anogenital warts [here](https://www.bashh.org/resources/52/genital_warts).1

### Follow-Up Review 

It is also important that patients are empowered to return to the GP if symptoms do not improve. BASHH recommends that an alternative treatment should be started if anogenital warts reduce by less than 50% after 8 weeks of imiquimod or sinecatechins, or 4 weeks of podophyllotoxin.1

#### _Smoking Cessation Advice_

The follow-up review is an opportune time to discuss smoking cessation. Smoking is correlated with higher incidence and recurrence of anogenital warts, so BASHH explicitly recommends providing smoking cessation advice to patients with the condition.1,13

3\. Refer Patients for Further Investigations or Specialist Management as Appropriate 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patients with atypical features on examination should be considered for biopsy, as these findings may indicate malignant or premalignant lesions.1,11 Some examples of signs and symptoms that would prompt this referral include bleeding, ulceration, and physician concerns regarding malignancy.1

The Royal College of General Practitioners’ guidance on STIs in primary care recommends that, when there is diagnostic uncertainty, patients should be referred to specialist care.11 Other reasons for referral to a level-3 sexual health service include the following:1,11

*   the patient is pregnant or breastfeeding
*   the patient is a child
*   the patient is immunocompromised
*   there is internal involvement (vaginal, anal, urethral)
*   there is bleeding, ulceration, or another clinical concern
*   the patient has recurrent anogenital warts.

Although contact tracing is not required for anogenital warts,1,4 sexual health services are best set up for contact tracing, so it may be appropriate to refer to one of these services if the patient has a concurrent STI and there are concerns of nondisclosure to sexual partners.14 It is essential that pregnant patients, children, and those who are immunocompromised are referred to sexual health, as these are high-risk groups.1,11 

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding 

Anogenital warts can increase in number and size during pregnancy.1,4 Many cases will self-resolve in the puerperium, so sexual health teams may advise pregnant patients to delay consideration of treatment until after delivery.1

None of the self-administered topical treatments are currently approved in pregnancy, and none of the self-administered treatments are licensed for patients who are breastfeeding.1,3 Therefore, these patients should be referred to sexual health services for treatment with cryotherapy, laser therapy, electrosurgery, surgical excision, or trichloroacetic acid.1 Patients should discuss the implications for delivery with their sexual health and obstetric teams.1

### Children 

If children present with anogenital warts, the possibility of sexual abuse will need to be considered.15 If there are any concerns regarding possible sexual abuse, wider input should be sought from safeguarding teams or paediatrics.15

### Immunocompromise 

Immunocompromised patients are at higher risk for extensive wart formation and malignancy, so should be referred to specialist services.1,16 However, as evidence is lacking, treatment recommendations for these patients are the same as for the general population.1

4\. Prioritise Patients With Recurrent Anogenital Warts for Ablative Treatments 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Studies have demonstrated highly variable recurrence rates for anogenital warts.1,4,7 Nevertheless, patients should be counselled that they are at higher risk of recurrence if they:1,4,7

*   have lesions at more than one anatomical site
*   are immunocompromised
*   are a smoker.

BASHH recommends prioritising those who experience recurrent or recalcitrant anogenital warts for surgical and laser treatments.1 When aiming to prevent recurrence, specific recommendation is given to laser treatment followed by 4–8 weeks of imiquimod.1 

5\. Understand the Psychosexual and Mental Health Impacts of Anogenital Warts 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patients with anogenital warts have higher rates of anxiety, depression, and psychosexual dysfunction than the general population.1,17–19 This may be due to associated pain, discomfort, feelings of shame or guilt, negative views of their self-image, or fears around transmission. A diagnosis of anogenital warts may also contribute to sexual dysfunction, such as vaginismus, dyspareunia, erectile dysfunction, or an orgasmic disorder.18

Therefore, a sexual function history should be taken at diagnosis and, if the patient has symptoms, they should be offered support and reassured that sexual dysfunction is common among people of all genders, ages, sexualities, and cultural backgrounds.1,11 The mental health of patients with recurrent anogenital warts should also be reviewed,1,11 as there can be significant impairment of their psychosocial wellbeing.19 In the author's opinion, the broad skillset of primary care doctors places them in an effective position for exploring the psychosocial implications of an anogenital warts diagnosis and managing any related or coexisting mental health issues.

6\. Offer the HPV Vaccine to Eligible Patients, and Explain That Different Forms of HPV Have Different Levels of Risk 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HPV vaccination programme began in 2008, and has been associated with a significant decline in the prevalence of anogenital warts:1,20,21 in the 2010–2019 period, prevalence dropped by 35%.1 Indeed, there is clear evidence that the HPV vaccine is highly effective at preventing anogenital warts when given prior to a first sexual encounter.20,21 Primary care professionals therefore play an important role in promoting public health and improving the prevention of anogenital warts by encouraging the uptake of the HPV vaccine to those who are eligible.

However, there is no evidence that the HPV vaccine has an impact on recurrent anogenital warts, and it is not recommended as a treatment for the condition.1,22 It should be clarified to patients that there are different forms of the virus, and that anogenital warts are associated with low-risk HPV genotypes, whereas cancer is associated with different high-risk HPV genotypes.1 Eligible patients should be counselled both to receive HPV vaccination and to continue attending their cervical screening at the recommended intervals, irrespective of whether they have been previously diagnosed with anogenital warts.1,11

Summary 
--------

Anogenital warts are a common, benign STI associated with low-risk HPV infection that can largely be diagnosed clinically. Although many cases resolve without treatment, there is a wide range of management options (including self- and clinician-administered treatments). It is important that primary care practitioners are familiar with these options, and are also aware of when they need to refer to sexual health services. Other important considerations in primary care include normalising sexual health screening, promoting public health measures, and discussing the psychosexual implications, as appropriate.

| Key Points |
| --- |
| 
*   Many cases of anogenital warts do not need treating and will self-resolve
*   Patients should be aware that the aim of treatment is to remove the visible lesions, but that sexual transmission to a partner can still happen when there are no visible lesions
*   Speculum or proctoscopic examination should be performed if there is suspicion of internal anogenital warts
*   Clinicians should always give advice to patients with anogenital warts on condom use and smoking cessation, and screen for other STIs 
*   Referral to a sexual health service should be offered if diagnosis is uncertain, if the patient is immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding, or a child, or if they have internal involvement, recurrence of anogenital warts, or another feature of significant clinical concern
*   No treatment option is recommend over others, but podophyllotoxin and imiquimod are two self-administered treatment options
*   Podophyllotoxin 0.5% solution can be more effective than the 0.15% cream if used on easy-to-reach areas 
*   Patients should be empowered to swap to an alternative treatment if there is limited response
*   Patients with difficult-to-treat or recurrent anogenital warts should be prioritised for laser treatment and/or surgical removal 
*   Contact tracing is not required for anogenital warts 
*   Eligible patients should be encouraged to get the HPV vaccine, as it is shown to be highly effective at preventing anogenital warts and cancer
*   Patients with a cervix should continue to attend cervical screening at the standard intervals
*   Primary care practitioners should discuss psychosexual wellbeing with patients, and refer to specialist services if required.
