2024-09-10 09:20:00,2024-09-11 01:41:20,"ü©∫ Are we overlooking potential viral triggers in MS development? A recent Swedish study suggests an intriguing link between rubella infection and an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) for unvaccinated individuals.

- KEY FINDINGS: The study found that having antibodies against the rubella virus correlated with a higher MS risk among those who were unvaccinated. This could imply that rubella may act as a risk factor for the disease, providing support for the viral trigger hypothesis in MS.
- STUDY INSIGHTS: Conducted on blood samples from 670 MS patients and matched controls, the research revealed that 93.7% of MS patients had anti-E1 antibodies, compared to 88.5% of healthy controls. Notably, unvaccinated MS patients were found to be four times more likely to have these antibodies compared to their unvaccinated counterparts.
- MECHANISM AT PLAY: The researchers propose that ‚Äúmolecular mimicry,‚Äù where the immune response against the rubella virus may inadvertently target similar human molecules, could explain this increased risk. The rubella virus shares protein similarities with myelin proteins essential in nerve function.

While these findings are promising, the authors urge caution due to possible false negatives in serological testing and the limited variable assessment of past vaccination statuses. As we reconsider MS risk factors, this emphasizes the need for further studies to validate these claims and deepen our understanding of viral implications in neurodegenerative diseases. 

What does this mean for your clinical practice? Are there additional screenings for viral infections that should be implemented for at-risk populations? ü§î

===============

Rubella infection may increase MS risk in unvaccinated people
=============================================================

Having antibodies against the rubella virus is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) in unvaccinated people, a Swedish study suggests.

The findings show a rubella infection may be a risk factor for MS, reinforcing the hypothesis that certain viral infections may trigger the misleading immune response that drives MS.

‚ÄúTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between [rubella virus] and MS in pre-¬≠MS samples,‚Äù wrote the researchers, who said additional studies will be needed to confirm the association between rubella infection and MS.

The study, ‚Äú[Rubella virus seropositivity after infection or vaccination as a risk factor for multiple sclerosis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.16387),‚Äù was published in the _European Journal of Neurology._

[MS is caused](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/) by an erroneous immune response that damages healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord. The reason for the immune response isn‚Äôt fully understood, but evidence suggests viral infections may be risk factors. Infection with the [Epstein-Barr virus](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/) (EBV), in particular, is one of the strongest risk factors for the neurodegenerative condition and some studies have found an association between MS and the human herpesvirus-6A. Also, up to 78% of MS patients have antibodies against measles, varicella zoster, and rubella viruses in their spinal fluid.

It‚Äôs believed that, due to some similarities between viral and human molecules, the immune system may mistakenly attack nerve cells when trying to fight a viral infection. This ‚Äúmolecular mimicry‚Äù is one proposed mechanism that may explain the association between viruses and a greater risk of MS.

The rubella virus has several proteins that share similarities with human proteins. One protein from its envelope, called E2, is similar to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), an essential protein in [myelin](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/), the fatty coating that covers nerve cells and target of immune responses in MS.

These similarities raise the possibility of a connection between the rubella virus, the immune response against it, and developing MS.

Researchers in Sweden compared blood samples from MS patients and controls collected before the neurological disease‚Äôs onset to determine if people who developed MS had signs of a previous rubella infection ‚Äî determined through the presence of anti-rubella antibodies ‚Äî before their diagnosis.

‚ÄúWith samples from both the pre-¬≠vaccination era and through the different stages of rubella vaccination in Sweden, we explored a unique opportunity to study [the rubella virus] in the field of MS,‚Äù the researchers wrote.

The study included blood samples from 670 MS patients and 670 matched controls. In both groups, female patients represented the majority (84%) and the median age was 25.

The researchers tested the samples for the presence of antibodies (seropositivity) that targeted the rubella E1 protein, which the virus uses to infect human cells, and their reactivity. More MS patients (93.7%) had anti-E1 antibodies than healthy controls (88.5%), data showed.

When patients and controls were divided based on their rubella vaccination status, seropositivity was only significantly higher in MS patients than controls in unvaccinated people, in whom the presence of antibodies indicates a previous rubella infection. After adjusting for factors such as antibodies against other viruses and vitamin D levels, unvaccinated MS patients were four times more likely to have rubella antibodies than unvaccinated controls. No significant differences were observed in vaccinated patients after accounting for the same factors.

The presence of antibodies in ‚Äúunvaccinated subjects (i.e., representing rubella infection) was associated with a higher risk of developing MS,‚Äù the researchers wrote. ‚ÄúMolecular mimicry is an attractive hypothesis for a possible mechanism behind these findings.‚Äù

The researchers advised caution when interpreting their findings, mainly because the test they used to determine seropositivity can have a lot of false negatives. Also, most of the participants received the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, adding variables that weren‚Äôt evaluated in the study.

‚ÄúFurther serological and epidemiological studies are needed to support our findings,‚Äù they wrote.",gpt-4o-mini,IDkcoKdjUueJWt2wF5MB

Regeneron is the second pharma group to sign up for access to data from a remote study run by health technology firm Koneksa that is exploring the use of digital biomarkers to track patients with Parkinson's disease.

The LEARNS trial ‚Äì which started earlier this year ‚Äì is using smartphone and wearable technologies to monitor disease progression in Parkinson's patients and find ways to use digital biomarkers in the development of disease-modifying therapies.

Regeneron has become a member of the data syndication programme for LEARNS, joining MSD/Merck & Co, which signed up in March, and will have real-time access to data and results from the study. Those can be used for ""natural history analysis, trial design, cohort formation, and data analysis,"" according to the partners.

Quantitative tools for measuring progression are lacking in Parkinson's and other neurological disorders, with clinicians relying on subjective measures that make it harder to monitor patients, particularly as the rate of symptom decline fluctuates and varies wildly between individuals with the disease.

LEARNS is set to enrol up to 70 participants with Parkinson's who will be followed for 12 months, with first results expected next year. It uses the Koneksa neuroscience toolkit, which combines iPhone-based active assessments and passive monitoring using a wrist-worn wearable.

""Detecting the earliest signs of Parkinson's disease and establishing the necessary evidence of validity for new measures are critical needs within the healthcare community,"" said Chris Benko, Koneksa's chief executive.

""Our goal is to bring together biotech and pharma companies with real-time data sharing and analysis to expedite the validation and adoption of digital measures to unlock more data insights in clinical trials,"" he added.

Other projects looking at digital biomarkers for Parkinson's include the crowd-sourced DREAM Challenge, which saw 40 research teams from around the world contribute ways to process accelerometer and gyroscope data from consumer wearable devices that can be used to track muscle tremor, dyskinesia, and bradykinesia - three prominent symptoms of the disease.

Regeneron's pipeline doesn't currently include a clinical-stage treatment for Parkinson's, but it is working on drugs for other neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

""At Regeneron, we believe that digital biomarkers have the potential to improve the development of novel therapeutics, and collaboration helps make this a reality,"" said the company's head of clinical development for genetic diseases, Gary Herman.

STOCKHOLM, Sept. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Diamyd Medical will pursue an accelerated approval pathway in the U.S. for its antigen-specific immunotherapy, Diamyd¬Æ (rhGAD65/alum), aimed at preserving endogenous insulin production in patients with Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes. An earlier interim study readout from the ongoing Phase 3 trial, DIAGNODE-3, is planned to serve as the basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) under the accelerated approval pathway. Results from the interim readout are expected around March 2026.

""We are committed to working at full speed with our partners and in close dialogue with the FDA to seize this unprecedented opportunity of making Diamyd¬Æ available to patients as quickly as possible,"" says Ulf Hannelius, CEO of Diamyd Medical. ""The earlier readout from the DIAGNODE-3 trial represents a critical step in this process and our confidence in Diamyd¬Æ's disease-modifying benefits is boosted by the positive outcome of the recently announced futility analysis. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to ensure that all necessary regulatory requirements are met.""

Diamyd Medical recently announced Fast track designation in the U.S. for Diamyd¬Æ, and that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has acknowledged that accelerated approval could be sought based on a demonstration of significant treatment-related benefits on C-peptide levels, a measure of endogenous insulin production, in response to Diamyd¬Æ administration. The FDA's Accelerated approval program allows drugs for serious conditions that fills an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. Using a surrogate endpoint allows the FDA the potential to approve these drugs faster.

To prepare the BLA under the FDA's Accelerated Approval Program, Diamyd Medical plans to conduct an interim study readout, including efficacy data from approximately 170 participants who have completed their 15-month assessment and safety data from additional individuals enrolled in the DIAGNODE-3 trial. The primary endpoint for this analysis will be C-peptide, a surrogate endpoint now recognized by the FDA as reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Following the interim readout, the DIAGNODE-3 trial will continue to follow all enrolled patients until the 24-month end-of-study assessment. To date, 148 patients have been randomized in DIAGNODE-3. The results of the interim study readout are expected around March 2026, the exact time depending on the final number of participants to be included in the readout, followed by submission of a BLA under the accelerated approval pathway.

The DIAGNODE-3 trial, which is being conducted in eight European countries and the United States, is expected to fully recruit approximately 330 patients by the end of 2025, and all patients are expected to be fully treated before the time the earlier readout is to be performed. The trial focuses on recently diagnosed patients with Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes carrying the HLA DR3-DQ2 genotype; a subgroup of approximately 40% of Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes patients that has been shown to respond to Diamyd¬Æ in previous trials.

**About Diamyd Medical**

- Welireg is now an option specifically for treating VHL-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), brain and spinal cord tumours (haemangioblastomas), or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs), especially when surgery isn‚Äôt viable. üéâ
- Previously, options were limited to invasive surgeries or radiotherapy, often requiring recurrent operations throughout a patient‚Äôs life.
- With roughly 600 VHL patients in England, about 100 are expected to benefit from Welireg, with an additional 50 cases each year thereafter. This represents a significant improvement in management for these patients.
- After a previous hesitance from NICE regarding economic evidence, the route is now clearer for healthcare providers following an access agreement with NHS England. The decision is conditional, allowing for continued collection of efficacy data. üìà

Patients in England and Wales with a rare genetic disorder will soon be able to access treatment with MSD's Welireg via the NHS, nearly a year after their counterparts in Scotland.

In final draft guidance due to be finalised before the end of the month, Welireg (belzutifan) has been recommended as an option for treating adults with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a rare and life-shortening disease that can lead to the development of benign and cancerous tumours and cysts.

Specifically, Welireg becomes an option for VHL-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), brain and spinal cord tumours (haemangioblastomas), or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) when localised treatment like surgery isn't appropriate.

Until now, the only therapies available to patients with VHL have been invasive surgery or radiotherapy, with patients usually requiring multiple surgeries throughout their lives.

There are only about 600 adults in England living with the condition, and around 100 of them could be eligible for treatment with Welireg, with another 50 cases per year thereafter.

The decision comes after NICE withheld a recommendation for the drug last December, saying there were ""uncertainties"" in the clinical and economic evidence submitted for its appraisal. The SMC in Scotland backed NHS use of the drug in October 2023.

The new NICE recommendation is conditional, meaning that Welireg can be used while more evidence for its efficacy is collected, according to Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE. It comes after NHS England reached a commercial access deal with the manufacturer.

The appraisal committee heard from patient experts who explained that some people with VHL have a wide variety of debilitating symptoms depending on where the tumours are growing in the body. These include pain, loss of balance and motor skills, loss of vision, breathlessness, coughing, headaches, confusion, severe nausea, and fatigue.

Graham Lovitt, chair of patient advocacy group VHL UK/Ireland, said Welireg has ""game-changing potential"" and has shown extraordinary results for some patients in trials, including stabilisation of the tumours, reduction in growth, and ‚Äì in some cases ‚Äì the eradication of tumours altogether.

""We are delighted by NICE's recommendation of belzutifan [‚Ä¶] a significant milestone in the fight against this rare disease,"" he added. ""This decision brings hope to qualifying patients and their families, offering them an alternative treatment option, when others become too high risk.""

Welireg (belzutifan), an oral HIF-2 alpha inhibitor, has been approved by the UK drugs regulator the MHRA for VHL since May 2022. MSD acquired it as part of its $2.2 billion takeover of Peloton Therapeutics in 2019.

Despite the rarity of VHL tumours, MSD has blockbuster aspirations for Welireg, and now has a second regulatory approval for the drug in relapsed or refractory advanced RCC, with clinical trials on the go in glioblastoma multiforme, a hard-to-treat form of brain cancer.",gpt-4o-mini,xHsWqgfq1ua0uwlYo3u8

======================================================

The mRNA vaccine candidate more effectively limited symptoms and disease duration in non-human primates.

A study, funded by Moderna, the National institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) compared an investigational mRNA mpox vaccine from Moderna to a currently licensed Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine. The new mRNA vaccine candidate more effectively limits symptoms and disease duration in non-human primates infected with a lethal strain of mpox.

Alec Freyn, virology researcher at Moderna and co-first author, stated: ‚ÄúThis study is the first in a nonhuman primate model where we compare an investigational mRNA mpox vaccine directly to the current standard of care.‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúWhen we put those vaccines head-to-head in primates, we saw improved responses from the mRNA vaccine in terms of not just protection from survival but also fewer lesions, shorter duration of disease, and less viral shedding in the blood and respiratory tract.‚Äù

Originally designed to combat smallpox, MVA vaccines contained weakened whole viruses. Yet, this weakening means that they provide limited protection compared to other vaccines. The use of mRNA technology enables vaccines to be developed to only include parts of the virus that are most likely to induce a lasting, protective immune response without exposing the person to a whole infectious virus. The investigational mpox mRNA vaccine is composed of four viral antigens that are essential for the virus to attach and enter host cells.

Previous research has demonstrated that mRNA vaccines can prevent lethal mpox infections in nonhuman primates but their ability to lessen disease severity has not been tested. Therefore, to directly compare the investigational mRNA vaccine to MVA vaccines, the team vaccinated six macaques with each vaccine and then exposed them to a lethal strain of mpox virus eight weeks after their initial vaccine dose. Also, they exposed a control group of six unvaccinated animals to mpox. Then, after infection, the researchers monitored the macaque‚Äôs health for four weeks and collected blood samples to study their immune response.

Disease severity
----------------

Five of the unvaccinated control animals did not survive, whereas all 12 vaccinated animals did, regardless of which vaccine was used. The mRNA-vaccinated animals lost less weight and had fewer lesions than MVA-vaccinated animals, despite both vaccines limiting disease severity compared to the control group.

Furthermore, the mRNA vaccine shortened disease duration, measured by the number of days for which the animals showed lesions, by more than 10 days compared to the MVA vaccine. Lower viral loads were in the blood and throat swabs, indicating that it might be more effective at reducing transmission.

Jay Hooper, virologist at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and senior author explained: ‚ÄúWith the mRNA technology, we‚Äôre able to produce a vaccine that gives quite potent responses with a very tolerable safety profile‚Ä¶We‚Äôve been trying to get a vaccine that will prevent spread like ACAM2000¬Æ but without the safety issues. This is showing that mRNA technology might be able to fill that niche.‚Äù

Immune response
---------------

The mRNA vaccine resulted in a higher number of antibodies and antibodies with more diverse immune functions. Different classes of antibodies that were associated with enhanced viral control and fewer lesions were identified.

Furthermore, the vaccine demonstrated potential to induce cross-immunity to other Orthopoxviruses, whereas the MVA vaccine results in smaller immune responses that are not as strongly neutralising for more remotely related Orthopoxviruses. Serum from the macaques immunised with the mRNA vaccine ‚Äúneutralised not only mpox but also vaccinia, cowpox, rabbitpox, camelpox, and ectromelia virus,‚Äù Freyn said. ‚ÄúWe believe that this vaccine may protect from other Orthopoxvirus threats that may emerge in the future.‚Äù

Now, Moderna‚Äôs mRNA-1769 vaccine is being assessed in a Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT05995275) to determine the safety, tolerability and immune response of a range of doses of mRNA-1769.

GSK's severe asthma therapy Nucala could find a new lease of life as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) after showing a clear benefit in a phase 3 trial.

The headline result from the MATINEE trial of IL-5 inhibitor Nucala (mepolizumab) in adults with COPD was a statistically significant reduction in the annualised rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared to placebo that GSK said was ""clinically meaningful."" In the study, Nucala was added to inhaled maintenance therapy for COPD.

GSK has been studying Nucala in COPD for some time, and in 2017 reported mixed results for the drug in two earlier phase 3 trials called METREX and METREO.

METREX involved patients with a range of eosinophil levels and showed a statistically significant improvement for Nucala versus placebo on exacerbation rates. However, in METREO ‚Äì which focused on patients with higher levels only ‚Äì the difference between the two arms was not significant.

The company decided to file for approval regardless, but the FDA declined to approve the new indication in 2018, following the advice of an advisory committee, which found that GSK had not proved efficacy. It seems MATINEE will allow GSK to try its luck again.

The size of the improvement over placebo ‚Äì which reportedly extended for up to two years in the trial ‚Äì won't be available until the study is presented at a future medical congress, but is strong enough to warrant discussions with regulators about extending the indications for Nucala, according to the pharma group. It has previously suggested approval for COPD could come in the US in the first half of next year.

Nucala has been approved to treat severe eosinophilic asthma for almost a decade, and in the interim has had its label extended to include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome.

The drug remains one of GSK's top products, with sales of ¬£856 million ($1.1 billion) in the first half of this year, up 15%. COPD could open up a massive new market for the drug, which still has several years of patent life left before it could face biosimilar competition.

The lung disease affects more than 300 million people globally, with up to 40% of patients exhibiting type 2 inflammation characterised by a raised blood eosinophil count, which would make them suitable for treatment with Nucala.

Elevated eosinophil levels are associated with more severe COPD and a higher rate of exacerbations, the sudden flare-ups in symptoms that signal the progression of the disease and can lead to hospitalisation.

The MATINEE data comes at a time when options for COPD are on the up, after a decade with no new therapies.

In July, the European Commission became the first regulator worldwide to approve Sanofi and Regeneron's big-selling IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor Dupixent (dupilumab) as a treatment for the progressive lung disease, shortly after Verona Pharma got the go-ahead from the US FDA for its PDE 3/4 inhibitor Ohtuvayre (ensifentrine).

Dupixent ‚Äì which is due for a verdict from the FDA as a COPD therapy later this month ‚Äì was cleared for adults with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils, while Ohtuvayre can be used in all patients regardless of eosinophil levels.",gpt-4o-mini,0zIOYAyGUzOwaCYodEu0

Earlier this week, I visited one of Paris‚Äô few longevity clinics dedicated to preventative medicine ‚Äî and the only one that describes itself as a tech startup.

Hidden behind an unassuming Haussmannian door, just a few minutes away from the Paris Opera, the centre has been operating for nine months. The startup behind it, Zoƒ´, promises customers a ‚Äú360-degree check-up‚Äô ‚Äî a three-hour series of tests and exams, ranging from blood tests to eye scans through spirometry and gut microbiome analyses.

The objective? Collect millions of data points on up to 200 biomarkers that are in turn analysed by an AI model, in order to deliver lifestyle recommendations that, promises Zoƒ´, will prevent disease and improve customers‚Äô long-term wellness.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about adding years of life, but rather life to years,‚Äù says Zoƒ´ cofounder ‚Äî and former special advisor to French president Emmanuel Macron ‚Äî Isma√´l Em√©lien. ‚ÄúThe goal is to learn the body‚Äôs ‚Äòuser manual‚Äô to prevent illnesses and enable people to live in good health for longer.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not for everyone. Membership to Zoƒ´ is ‚Ç¨3.6k per year, which includes an annual checkup as well as the follow-up recommendations. That‚Äôs roughly the cost of a membership to Soho House, says Zoƒ´'s CFO Antoine Attali ‚Äî and the startup's customers usually belong to the same social circles.

The clinic caters to premium needs, from snacks elaborated by world-famous chef Alain Ducasse to a balneotherapy section modelled on ‚ÄòJapanese thermal baths‚Äò, featuring a snow cabin (?) and a mineral bath that is, I am told, ‚Äútwice as salty as the Dead Sea‚Äù.

Attali tells me that in the long-term, Zoƒ´ hopes to become accessible to everyone, and that prices will go down to a similar level to your average WiFi subscription.

For now, though, preventative health remains a hobby of the upper-class. In fact, Zoƒ´'s investors are all private individuals; the company‚Äôs ‚Ç¨20m seed round, which it raised in 2022, included a good number of high-profile billionaires such as Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saad√© and Moderna CEO St√©phane Bancel.

And Zoƒ´ is not the only longevity startup appealing to the ultra-rich. Spotify founder Daniel Ek is behind similar ventures, including [Sand Clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-ek-spotify-sand-clinic-longevity-news), where customers can receive full body check-ups and treatments ranging from vacuum therapy to red light saunas ‚Äî with membership expected to cost between ‚Ç¨1,000 and ‚Ç¨10,000 a month.

Ek is also the founder of healthtech Neko Health, which has built a full-body scanner for health data collection that it says helps doctors detect potential diseases earlier. The company [has a clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/ek-neko-body-scanner-test) and has just opened a new spot in London, right in the middle of Marylebone, where it prices a one-hour scan at ¬£299 ‚Äî almost double the price of a visit to the Stockholm clinic when it opened in 2023 (‚Ç¨180).

Despite the cost, the proposition seems appealing enough. Neko Health says it already has a waiting list of 22k people; Zoƒ´ says it has ‚Äúaround 1k members‚Äù to date and is currently carrying out a dozen check-ups per day ‚Äî but the startup is confident that it can ramp up to reach its maximum capacity of 35k annual check-ups in the next five years.

Whether or not the preventative treatments promised by startups like Zoƒ´, Neko Health and Sand Clinic will ever reach the masses remains to be seen; what seems certain for now is that billionaires won‚Äôt get tired of full-body-scanning anytime soon.

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","UK-based healthtech Doccla has secured a ¬£35m Series B, led by European VC Lakestar, with new investors French VC Elaia and existing investors General Catalyst, Speedinvest and the investment leg of German media company Bertelsmann also participating.

Having almost quadrupled its annual revenue in 2023, it's planning its expansion in DACH and France, and says its German and French investors will help its international growth plans.

The startup, founded in 2019, makes ‚Äúvirtual ward‚Äù technology for healthcare providers. It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.

Doccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland‚Äôs Health Service Executive (HSE).

Doccla‚Äôs founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.

‚ÄúWith the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it‚Äôs a huge opportunity to scale,‚Äù says Ratz.

The virtual A&E

Sweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.

According to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.

Patients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.

So far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it‚Äôs adding 1k new patients every month.

‚ÄúOver time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,‚Äù Ratz says.

Partnering with pharma

Doccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).

‚ÄúWe have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,‚Äù Ratz says. ‚ÄúThis is because we are in very close contact with our patients.‚Äù

Doccla says it‚Äôs interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he‚Äôs seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.

With 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.

In one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.

‚ÄúWe can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits ‚Äî in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,‚Äù Ratz says.

Doccla has raised a total of ¬£52m to date.

In October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.",gpt-4o-mini,w5bIVyGtofH28rqegF1I

- Caresyntax, a Berlin-based startup, has recently secured a substantial $180 million in Series C funding to further develop its AI-driven surgical data platform, bringing total equity funding to $220 million. This includes $80 million in equity and $100 million in debt, aimed at enhancing their technology that integrates with any operating room setup. 

- üöÄ With their goal to become the ""Android"" of surgical platforms, Caresyntax plans to leverage AI to analyze 1,000 data points per surgery. This capability not only supports surgeons in enhancing patient outcomes but also helps identify risks in real-time, such as unrecognized drops in heart rate during operations. 

- The platform streamlines workflows, informs post-operative care, and addresses the significant costs associated with surgeries, which account for 30% of healthcare expenditures in Europe alone. As healthcare systems face increasing pressures from aging populations and staffing shortages, innovations like this can allow for more effective resource management. 

- With the tech currently utilized in over 3,000 operating rooms and more than 3 million surgeries each year, Caresyntax‚Äôs expansion into the US and EMEA markets could redefine operational efficiency in surgery. 

As we see these advancements, what implications might this have for surgical practice and patient safety??

The round is made up of $80m in equity and $100m in debt ‚Äî and is tied to specific milestones. The fresh funding tops up the startup‚Äôs $130m Series C, raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.

It‚Äôs the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.

Caresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.

### AI for hospitals

Caresyntax says it wants to build the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals‚Äô surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.

The company‚Äôs platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.

While some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax‚Äôs platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.

‚ÄúEffectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,‚Äù they add.

If it does what it sets out to do, it‚Äôs a big opportunity.

Costs associated with operations account for 30% of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends 11% of GDP on health.

Founded in 2013 in Germany ‚Äî Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 ‚Äî its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company‚Äôs revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.

- GLP-1s, including popular drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy from Novo Nordisk, have seen skyrocketing valuations, with projections suggesting they could generate a staggering $150 billion in sales by the early 2030s.
- Startup founders are quickly recognizing the potential of these medications. For instance, Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform, has begun incorporating GLP-1s into their treatment regimens this year, noting double-digit growth in revenue and patient numbers.
- The excitement isn‚Äôt limited to established firms; new entrants are pivoting their business models to focus on GLP-1s, showcasing a remarkable shift in treatment paradigms for obesity.
- Despite the strong interest, challenges remain. With supply chain issues and reimbursement hurdles from national healthcare systems, particularly in Europe, startups may struggle to scale effectively.
- It's essential for these companies to secure reimbursement from public health systems to ensure broader access and sustainable growth. For example, while Wegovy is available through NHS clinics, it‚Äôs currently restrictive and not widely accessible.

As we assess the implications of this groundbreaking class of drugs on healthcare economics and treatment protocols, how do you think we can better facilitate access for patients seeking effective weight loss solutions?

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","The meteoric rise of a new class of weight loss drugs over the past two years, known as GLP-1s, has seen a new name take the title of Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, helped a country dodge a recession and hit grocery sales in the US.

The valuations of the companies that make this so-called ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù class of drugs ‚Äî which includes Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and US rival Eli Lilly (maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) ‚Äî have soared as investors bet big on a medication projected by some to hit $150bn in sales by the early 2030s.

The potential of the market has not been lost on founders.

It‚Äôs a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù opportunity, says Kai Eberhardt, the founder and CEO of Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform which operates in the UK, France and Germany, alongside its home market. It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.

‚ÄúFor us [GLP-1 drugs] are already a strong growth driver,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.‚Äù

While treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva‚Äôs overall business ‚Äî Eberhardt says it‚Äôs growing total patient and revenue numbers by ‚Äúdouble digit‚Äù percentage points year-on-year ‚Äî the meds could become the startup‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest‚Äù growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.

### Riding the wave

Oviva‚Äôs not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity ‚Äî many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.

In the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart‚Äôs CEO, food sales have fallen as the one in eight adults in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, propping up Denmark‚Äôs GDP in the process.

All of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have convinced them to get out their chequebook: Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a ‚Ç¨10m Series A in August 2023 a year on from a ‚Ç¨3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised ‚Ç¨3.1m last summer.

Many startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn‚Äôt start life offering them ‚Äî largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.

UK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs health‚Äù brand, but has recently changed that. The company‚Äôs website uses images of men and women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.

Yazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.

Meurling tells Sifted it had hit ‚Ç¨14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It‚Äôs now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.

Other startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men‚Äôs sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.

‚Äú[GLP-1 meds] are a game changer,‚Äù says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be ‚Äústrange‚Äù if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn‚Äôt looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.

While GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the ‚Äúhype‚Äù surrounding the drug class has ‚Äúopened doors‚Äù for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler ‚Äî adding that the startup managed to raise its ‚Ç¨400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It‚Äôs now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it‚Äôll look to target US employers ‚Äî who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.

### Kinks in the supply chain

There are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector ‚Äî not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.

Some of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate‚Äôs $100m in 2021 and Form Health‚Äôs $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than ‚Ç¨10m in a single round.

Investors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics ‚Äî Manual was still selling past the deadline.

If a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.

‚ÄúAs there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.‚Äù

### Who‚Äôll stump up the cash?

There‚Äôs also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.

While Numan‚Äôs head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the ‚Äúsuccess of private sector companies offering GLP-1 [drugs] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS‚Äù, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won‚Äôt be enough to hit real scale.

‚ÄúUS investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts [selling to whole organisations like health insurers],‚Äù says Syhler. ‚ÄúThis means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care ‚Äî where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.‚Äù

In Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.

In the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.

Oviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS ‚Äî but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it‚Äôs in ‚Äúmature dialogues with several health systems‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,‚Äù says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that don‚Äôt always want to work with startups. Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.

Whether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen ‚Äî but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. ‚ÄúI've never been an investor in a company that‚Äôs got so much attention ‚Äî in a space that‚Äôs got so much attention,‚Äù says Arnardottir.",gpt-4o-mini,OfJ8QLEaoTknkhadOIK3

TOPLINE:
--------

Mastitis in women over 50 years of age is a risk factor for development of breast cancer, according to a large retrospective cohort study of 2.4 million German women. Mastitis is an inflammation of breast tissue typically caused by a Staph infection.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   This study was a retrospective cohort of 2,381,594 women in 315 office-based gynaecology practices in Germany (2005-2021).
*   Women with mastitis (n = 14,892) were compared with women without mastitis (n = 14,892) and followed from 7 months to 10 years.
*   The control group without mastitis was propensity score-matched on age, index year, average yearly consultation frequency during the follow-up period, and coexisting conditions.
*   The primary outcome was an initial diagnosis of breast cancer.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Over the follow-up period, 2.9% of the mastitis cohort and 2.4% of the matched non-mastitis cohort developed breast cancer.
*   While Cox regression analysis uncovered a significant association between mastitis and breast cancer (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.11-1.70), the age-stratified analysis revealed a significant association only among women aged > 50 years. They had a 73% increase in the risk compared with women without mastitis (hazard ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.25-2.40).
*   Women aged ‚â§ 50 years had no significant increase in the risk for breast cancer.

IN PRACTICE:
------------

The authors concluded that ""The findings of our retrospective cohort study support an association between mastitis and subsequent breast cancer diagnoses in women aged > 50 years. The pathophysiological basis and possibility of confounders however requires further investigation.""

- A recent study involving 349 patients highlights the significance of circadian heart rate (HR) patterns. Researchers noted a strong correlation between impaired HR variability and both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, particularly in those with long-standing diabetes. 

- Key findings revealed that patients with low 24-hour heart rate standard deviation (SD) had nearly double the risk (hazard ratio: 1.99) of cardiovascular mortality and a 50% increase (hazard ratio: 1.50) in all-cause mortality compared to those with higher variability. 

- Further emphasizing this, the presence of a blunted nocturnal heart rate dip was linked to a 39% greater risk in both categories of mortality, suggesting that regular monitoring of heart rate is essential.  

With these findings, the potential for 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) as a practical risk stratification tool emerges for this vulnerable population.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

MADRID ‚Äî Impaired circadian heart rate (HR) fluctuations are linked to increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with long-standing diabetes.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Researchers analyzed data from 349 patients with type 2 (81%) or type 1 diabetes; about half were women, with a mean age of 57 years, body mass index (BMI) of 29.4, and A1c of 8.6%.
*   Participants underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (APBM) and HR monitoring, as well as assessment of diabetic microvascular complications.
*   The median SD value of ABPM-derived HR measurements was used to define patients with low daily HR fluctuations (low 24h-HR SD); a < 10% decline in average nighttime vs daytime HR identified patients (31%) with a blunted nocturnal HR dip.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   Low 24h-HR SD and blunted nocturnal HR dip were associated with an adverse cardiometabolic risk profile and a high prevalence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy and nephropathy.
*   After a mean 21 years of follow-up, 136 (39%) deaths occurred, of which 100 (68%) had a cardiovascular cause.
*   After adjustment for potential confounders ‚Äî including age, sex, BMI, glycemic control, diabetes type, and hypertension ‚Äî the low 24h-HR SD group had double the risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.99) for cardiovascular mortality and a 50% higher risk (HR, 1.50) for all-cause mortality than the high 24h-HR SD group.
*   Patients with a blunted nocturnal HR dip consistently had a 39% higher adjusted risk for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.61 for both) than those with a preserved nocturnal HR dip.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

Impaired circadian HR fluctuations are associated with microvascular disease and increased long-term cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes, the authors wrote. ""Identifying these conditions via 24h-ABPM may provide a cost-effective risk stratification tool in this high-risk population.""

Key Points

**Question** What is the cost-effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)‚Äìguided risk-stratified mammography screening intervals in the United Kingdom National Breast Cancer Screening Program?

**Findings** This decision analytical model evaluated 4 AI-based risk-stratified screening interval regimens in comparison with the current United Kingdom screening program. The net monetary benefit of introducing the optimal regimen ranged from approximately ¬£60.4 million (US $77.3 million) to ¬£85.3 million (US $109.2 million).

**Meaning** These results suggest that AI-based risk stratified breast cancer screening programs may be more cost-effective screening programs, providing additional health benefits with fewer resources than universal screening intervals for all.

**Importance** Previous research has shown good discrimination of short-term risk using an artificial intelligence (AI) risk prediction model (Mirai). However, no studies have been undertaken to evaluate whether this might translate into economic gains.

**Objective** To assess the cost-effectiveness of incorporating risk-stratified screening using a breast cancer AI model into the United Kingdom (UK) National Breast Cancer Screening Program.

**Design, Setting, and Participants** This study, conducted from January 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024, involved the development of a decision analytical model to estimate health-related quality of life, cancer survival rates, and costs over the lifetime of the female population eligible for screening. The analysis took a UK payer perspective, and the simulated cohort consisted of women aged 50 to 70 years at screening.

**Exposures** Mammography screening at 1 to 6 yearly screening intervals based on breast cancer risk and standard care (screening every 3 years).

**Main Outcomes and Measures** Incremental net monetary benefit based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and National Health Service (NHS) costs (given in pounds sterling; to convert to US dollars, multiply by 1.28).

**Results** Artificial intelligence‚Äìbased risk-stratified programs were estimated to be cost-saving and increase QALYs compared with the current screening program. A screening schedule of every 6 years for lowest-risk individuals, biannually and triennially for those below and above average risk, respectively, and annually for those at highest risk was estimated to give yearly net monetary benefits within the NHS of approximately ¬£60.4 (US $77.3) million and ¬£85.3 (US $109.2) million, with QALY values set at ¬£20‚ÄØ000 (US $25‚ÄØ600) and ¬£30‚ÄØ000 (US $38‚ÄØ400), respectively. Even in scenarios where decision-makers hesitate to allocate additional NHS resources toward screening, implementing the proposed strategies at a QALY value of ¬£1 (US $1.28) was estimated to generate a yearly monetary benefit of approximately ¬£10.6 (US $13.6) million.

**Conclusions and Relevance** In this decision analytical model study of integrating risk-stratified screening with a breast cancer AI model into the UK National Breast Cancer Screening Program, risk-stratified screening was likely to be cost-effective, yielding added health benefits at reduced costs. These results are particularly relevant for health care settings where resources are under pressure. New studies to prospectively evaluate AI-guided screening appear warranted.

Early detection of breast cancer is a top priority for the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS). The NHS largely uses an age-based screening strategy, inviting women aged 50 to 70 years for mammography screening triennially; most other countries with a breast screening program adopt a biennial program. This one-size-fits-all approach might be improved by tailoring screening so that those at highest risk receive the greatest intensity of screening (risk-based screening).

The NHS is considering the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into mammogram interpretation for breast screening in the future. AI is currently not used in NHS breast screening appointments in the UK due to a lack of high-quality prospective studies, but emerging prospective data are promising.

In parallel with AI for cancer detection, AI for risk prediction has been proposed. One such model (Mirai) interprets data automatically generated from mammogram screenings, without the need for data collection through questionnaires. The AI model offers an immediate estimation of an individual‚Äôs short-term risk of cancer incidence following a mammogram with negative findings. The AI model is open source and freely available for research and is arguably the best (retrospectively) validated AI model for short-term breast cancer risk assessment. One analysis included an external validation across 7 hospitals spanning 3 continents, and overall, evidence suggests that in the short term, it attains a higher area under the receiving operating characteristics curve than classical risk models or breast density.

While the performance of the AI model for risk assessment is highly promising, one area that has not been rigorously evaluated is whether using the model to guide screening could offer value for money. Our aim was therefore to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of integrating risk-stratified screening using the model into the UK National Breast Cancer Screening Program, through a health economic model. We considered risk-based screening strategies that would be expected to require the same number of screens as the current triennial program, assuming perfect adherence. In practice, strategies that involve extended screening intervals for a larger proportion of the population than those who receive more frequent screening might require fewer screens overall.

Specific risk-stratified breast cancer screening regimens (RSBCRs), determined by risk thresholds, were based on recent work that used a simplified deterministic model to evaluate potential effectiveness. These RSBCRs involve screening intervals aligned with corresponding risk thresholds tailored for the AI model chosen for this research. In this report, we developed an economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 4 AI-based screening strategies in comparison with the current screening program. The economic model was then used to estimate health-related quality of life, survival, and NHS costs over the lifetime of the female population eligible for screening in the UK. Results from our analysis might inform future prospective evaluations of AI-guided screening.

This study was conducted from January 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024. We followed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) reporting guideline and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence methods of technology appraisal manual. We developed a discrete event simulation model in R, version 4.2.2, using the simmer‚Äô package (R Project for Statistical Computing) to accommodate individual attributes that evolve over time within the simulation such as breast cancer risk. The work was funded by Cancer Research UK and the policy research unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions. Because the data are drawn from publicly available sources, ethics approval is not required for decision modeling in the UK.

The following 4 strategies were distinguished by screening intervals in years for groups categorized by a 3-year risk score (RS):

1. One year (RS, ‚â•2.57%), 2 years (RS, 1.32%-2.57%), 3 years (RS, 1.22%-1.32%), or 6 years (RS, ‚â§1.22%)
2. One year (RS, ‚â•2.72%), 3 years (RS, 1.23%-2.72%), or 6 years (RS, ‚â§1.23%)
3. Two years (RS, ‚â•2.79%), 3 years (RS, 1.35%-2.79%), or 6 years (RS, ‚â§1.35%)
4. One year (RS, ‚â•2.20%), 3 years (RS, 1.23%-2.20%), or 4 years (RS, ‚â§1.23%).

The model focused on 5 dynamic processes: (1) Women transition between risk groups based on screen attendance and AI-model‚Äìassessed risk scores. (2) Mammogram accuracy is based on breast density, which changes as women age. (3) Attendance patterns to screening appointments are influenced by age and attendance history. (4) Attendance history and time intervals between screenings impact cancer stage. (5) Cancer prognosis is influenced by age, where it was identified (at regular screening or not), and attendance history, with worse outcomes for women who have not attended breast screenings.

Structure and Model Events

[Figure 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#zoi240951f1) depicts the model structure, illustrating the sequence of clinical events and potential pathways from initiation to screening, cancer detection, and mortality. Women enter the model at the first screening invitation at 50 years of age, with subsequent invitations occurring at regular intervals until 70 years of age. Each screening appointment includes an updated AI risk assessment, determining the timing of the next screen invitation. If a woman misses her initial screening, invitations are sent every 3 years thereafter. The model ends when individuals reach cancer-related mortality or mortality from all other causes.

At entry, women are assigned predetermined ages of noncancer mortality and have a chance of developing breast cancer up to 74 years of age, sourced from Office for National Statistics life expectancy tables (2018-2020) and NHS breast cancer registry data. The age at which symptomatic cancer is detected in a primary care setting is sampled from 2020 incidence data, adjusted for age-related lead time in the UK screening program using overdiagnosis estimates. Screening may identify cancer at an earlier age than this determined age of symptomatic cancer. Data on attendance from 2018 to 2019, stratified by age and screening history, were used to calculate attendance probability to a screening invitation. The NHS incurs a cost of ¬£14.52 (US $18.59) for each screening invitation (details of screening costs are in eTable 2 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1)). Screening invitations end at 70 years of age or the nearest subsequent year if screening is not scheduled at 70 years of age. For instance, in simulating the current program with screenings every 3 years, a woman attending screening at 68 years of age would receive her last invitation at 71 years of age, after which any developing cancers would be detected symptomatically.

Model Event: Screening Appointment

Attending women undergo a mammogram; if cancer is detected, further assessments are conducted. Breast density and AI model scores are from UK women aged 46 to 74 years and applied based on age and cancer presence. Details are available in eMethods 1 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1).

In the model, a woman‚Äôs age for potential tumor detection is set before her first screening and remains constant throughout her life. Screening detection ages are calculated by subtracting the tumor presence period from the age at which symptomatic cancer is detected. The tumor presence period is derived from national breast screening program data and is based on age, with mean durations ranging from approximately 6 years at 35 years of age to 8 years at 85 years of age.

Each mammography session has a cost of ¬£54.32 (US $69.53) and results in a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss of 0.0014 due to associated discomfort. A summary table of the diagnostic accuracy of mammography is presented in eTable 1 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1). Sensitivity estimates are sourced from recent estimates in a population-based screening program and vary based on breast density, ranging from 62% (dense) to 90% (not dense). False-positive results occur when no underlying tumor is present during a screening, with chances ranging from 1.5% (not dense) to 2.9% (dense), and they cause a QALY loss of 0.0771. Mammographic results indicating cancer leads to further assessments, which verify whether the cancer is present, and involve mammography, ultrasonography, and biopsy totaling ¬£484.90 (US $620.67). Detailed breakdowns of mammography‚Äôs diagnostic accuracy, screening and further assessment costs, and screen-related QALY losses are found in eTables 2 and 3 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1).

Model Event: Interval Between Screening Appointments

Between screening appointments, cancers are detected immediately in primary care on reaching the age of symptomatic detection, with the primary care appointment costing ¬£37.00 (US $47.36), and further assessment totaling ¬£484.90 (US $620.67) NHS cost. Mortality due to other causes than breast cancer can occur and aging results in a health utility loss based on a published formula.

Model Event: Cancer Treatment and Survival

After cancer detection, cancer is classified as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive tumor TNM stages I to IV, determined by age and mode of detection (at a screening appointment or symptomatically in primary care) using UK population screening data. The stage distribution is adjusted based on the time since the last screen, using US data comparing stage distribution by screening frequency. Detailed methodology and sources can be found in Hill et al.

Treatment-related health losses and NHS costs vary by age, stage, mode of detection (screen or symptomatic), and time since detection (for follow-up costs and health recovery). Health utility losses after cancer are taken from multivariate regression, using the utility decrements on age, stage, and mode of detection. Recovery times are 11 years for screen-detected and interval cancers and 12 years for symptomatic cancers, based on peak health-related quality of life values post cancer detection. Stage 4 cancers are assumed to show no improvement in quality of life.

Cancer survival estimates come from Office for National Statistics mortality statistics and multivariable regressions. Mortality hazard ratios by stage and detection mode are applied to age-based mortality to determine life expectancy. Cancer treatment-related utility losses, costs, and survival estimates are available in eTables 4 to 6 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1).

Economic and Clinical Outcomes

Costs were assessed from a UK payer perspective and reported in 2022 pounds sterling. Quality-adjusted life-years and costs were discounted at 3.5%. The main economic outcome is incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) per woman, which quantifies in monetary terms the net benefit of interventions by reflecting the potential alternative use of intervention resources for other health care treatments. Incremental net monetary benefit is established from differences in patient costs, and from assigning a monetary value to the difference in QALYs, which we assume to be ¬£20 000 (US $25 600), ¬£30 000 (US $38 400), and ¬£1 (US $1.28) per QALY. The latter represents a scenario where a decision-maker is reluctant to spend additional NHS resources to increase population health. Population-wide INMB is derived by multiplying the per-woman INMB by the population size of women at 50 years of age eligible for screening invitations, which is 174‚ÄØ523, sourced from the 2022 national breast screening program data. Clinical outcomes include tumor stage at detection, cancers detected during screening, breast cancer deaths prevented by RSBCRs in the population (174‚ÄØ523 women), and the number of screens conducted.

All analyses were performed using R, version 4.2.2 (R Program for Statistical Computing). We conducted external validation of the model against targets derived from the 2022 national breast screening program data. To identify where savings occur, cost results are divided into screening-related costs and those for treating DCIS and invasive cancers. Cancer treatment costs are broken down by stage (DCIS, stages I-II, and stages III-IV) and mode of detection (screen-detected and interval cancers). Deterministic sensitivity analysis is conducted by adjusting the cancer treatment and screening costs, health-related quality of life losses from cancer and screening, and mammography sensitivity. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is performed using 250 Monte Carlo simulations using probabilistic sensitivity analysis parameter distributions reported in eTable 8 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1). The probability that each RSBCR is cost-effective is illustrated on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Population-wide INMB estimates from the 250 Monte Carlo simulations are calculated across cost per QALY values ranging from ¬£1 (US $1.28) to ¬£100 000 (US $128 000).

[Table 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#zoi240951t1) shows base-case economic results and the annual impact of the economic results in the entire population. All the AI-based regimens were associated with reduced NHS costs and increased QALYs compared with the current screening program. The strategy of conducting screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk had the highest additional net monetary gain per woman invited for screening. This amounts to ¬£346 (US $442.88) and ¬£489 (US $625.92) under the assumption of QALY values being ¬£20‚ÄØ000 (US $25 600) and ¬£30 000 (US $38 400), respectively. Consequently, this leads to an annual net monetary benefit within the NHS screening program totaling ¬£10.6 million (US $13.6 million) for QALY values of ¬£1, ¬£60.4 million (US $77.3 million) for QALY values of ¬£20 000, and ¬£85.3 million (US $109.2 million) for QALY values of ¬£30 000. The 3 alternative approaches had comparable figures for the net monetary benefit gained. For instance, the screening strategy of 6 yearly, triannual, and biannual screening has the smallest incremental net monetary benefit, amounting to ¬£188 (US $240.64) and ¬£236 (US $302.08) per person, assuming QALY values of ¬£20 000 and ¬£30 000, respectively. This resulted in an annual population incremental net benefit of ¬£32.7 million (US $41.9 million), assuming ¬£20 000 per QALY and ¬£41.2 million (US $52.7 million), assuming ¬£30 000 per QALY.

[Table 2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#zoi240951t2) shows the clinical and screening program results. The clinical outcomes of all regimens showed an improvement compared with the current screening program. Compared with the current screening program, conducting screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk resulted in a higher number of screen-detected cancers (10‚ÄØ549 vs 8943), a greater percentage of DCIS cancers at detection (17.1% vs 13.6%), a reduction in the number of screens (mean [SD], 3.22 [0.02] vs 4.68 [0.05]), and prevention of 834 deaths due to breast cancer.

Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis Results

The deterministic sensitivity analysis results align with the cost-effectiveness of screening regimens found in the base-case model. Screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk was likely to be most beneficial. Risk-stratified breast cancer screening regimens maintained their cost-effectiveness compared with the current program and each other. The breakdown of NHS costs incurred by women shows screening costs are lower in the RSBCR than in the current program. Cancer treatment costs incurred are larger for RSBCRs due to life extension for patients with cancer from increased screen detection of cancers and early cancer detection.

Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis Results

The probabilistic sensitivity analysis results demonstrate an improvement in the cost-effectiveness of screening regimens compared with the base-case model, without a shift in the ranking of programs from most to least cost-effective. The regimen with screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, or 6 years had the highest probability of being cost-effective (59% at ¬£20‚ÄØ000 [US $25 600] per QALY) and had the largest net monetary benefit for all cost per QALY thresholds. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve shows the regimen of 2, 3, or 6 years was likely to be the least cost-effective alternative option for RSBCRs, and the current screening program has a negligible probability of being cost-effective across all cost per QALY thresholds.

Under our analytic model, AI-based risk-stratified screening is likely to be cost-effective compared with the current one-size-fits-all screening program. Our findings are consistent with previous modeling studies demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of risk-stratified screening, whether based on traditional risk factors like family history or newer methods such as polygenic risk scores. However, our model is the first to suggest that health care resources might be reduced with RSBCRs, while attaining at least the same effectiveness for the population. This study is also the first to assess the cost-effectiveness of AI interpretation of breast images for risk assessment during routine screening. This might be more feasible at scale than the other risk assessment methods.

While the estimated incremental economic benefits per individual invited to breast screening may seem modest in the base-case model, ranging from ¬£188 (US $240.64) to ¬£346 (US $442.88), the annual monetary gains for the NHS might be substantial, estimated to range from ¬£32.7 million (US $ 41.9 million) to ¬£60.4 million (US $77.3 million). In the probabilistic model, these savings are around 3 times larger. The health economic model suggests that RSBCRs can reduce screening utilization, NHS costs, and invasive cancer in the population and increase QALYs. The reduction in the number of screenings with an RSBCR could free up resources to address screening backlogs and reduce wait times where those problems exist in the UK, potentially further improving breast cancer outcomes.

Annual screening RSBCRs lead to higher percentages of screen-detected cancers and greater percentages of DCIS cancers at detection, along with higher QALYs. However, biennial screening for the highest-risk group, with corresponding 3 and 6 yearly screening for other risk groups, incurs lower costs due to fewer screenings. Screen utilization is not the only explanation of the difference in cost-effectiveness among the regimens. Other contributing factors are the proportion of individuals at medium and high risk within the population undergoing intensified screening surveillance, their uptake to screening appointments, and the accuracy of mammography in women with denser breast tissue that makes cancers harder to detect. Although cost-effectiveness is important, it is not the only factor to consider when comparing the benefits of the regimen. For example, a population accustomed to the UK‚Äôs triennial screening program may view a 6-year gap between screenings as unacceptable, favoring a 4-year interval instead. This change to an RSBCR screening program with a 4-year screening interval for patients at low risk would generate an annual monetary benefit of ¬£50 million (US $64 million), assuming a QALY is valued at ¬£20 000 (US $25 600). Significant variations in screening frequency within programs can be accepted by patients. In the UK, colonoscopy surveillance guidelines for cancer vary by risk level, with no surveillance for patients at low risk, every 3 years for patients at intermediate risk, and annually for patients at high risk.

This study has some limitations. First, the model is parametrized for the UK. Findings may not be directly generalizable to alternative geographical populations, such as the US or elsewhere in Europe. Clinical guidelines in these regions often recommend universal annual or biennial screening, while a triennial screening program is in place in the UK, and typically screening also begins at earlier ages in these regions. Therefore, the comparator screen detection rates based on triennial screening, on which the model depends, are likely to differ across populations with varied screening frequencies and onset ages. For example, in a setting where annual screening is the norm, all the regimens considered would reduce costs but also effectiveness. Further analysis using the model could usefully contribute to decisions on the economic value of decreasing intensity of screening based on breast cancer AI in such settings.

In this decision analytical model study of risk-based screening with AI-based risk assessment, risk-based screening delivered health benefits while using fewer NHS resources compared with the current UK breast screening program. New studies to prospectively evaluate AI-guided screening appear warranted.

A recent study sheds light on a concerning disparity in the UK healthcare system:
- A retrospective analysis of nearly 300,000 heart disease patients reveals that women, Black individuals, and residents of deprived areas are significantly less likely to receive cardiac surgeries like CABG and valve procedures.
- üö® Key findings indicate that these demographics have:
  - 59% (women), 32% (Black patients), and 35% (deprived communities) lower access to CABG.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

MADRID ‚Äî In a rat study, two versions of an experimental monthly injectable semaglutide-loaded hydrogel show extended release over 1 month and good tolerance. If found to be safe and effective in people, a once-monthly formulation could improve patient adherence and quality of life of those with type 2 diabetes or obesity.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   About half or more patients taking semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist approved for treating obesity with or without type 2 diabetes, may discontinue treatment with their once-weekly subcutaneous injections or daily oral pills at 12 months, but longer-acting formulations may increase drug efficacy and patient adherence.
*   Researchers have developed two versions of an injectable semaglutide-loaded hydrogel mixed with a pair of degradable polymers that chemically bond together.
*   After injection, the formulations form either a gel disk or microgel suspension that enables a gradual and prolonged drug release.
*   To identify the optimal formulation, researchers analyzed the hydrogel compositions in vitro to study drug release kinetics, duration of effectiveness, and semaglutide loading content.
*   The experimental semaglutide-loaded hydrogel disk or microgel particles were injected subcutaneously in six wild-type Wistar Han male rats of normal weight (250-300 g) to characterize semaglutide pharmacokinetics and hydrogel biocompatibility.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   The formulation could be easily injected using a 25G needle, with gelation starting within minutes of mixing.
*   In both versions, a single injection of the hydrogel-based formulations in rats demonstrated a minimal initial early release, followed by a consistent release over the course of 1 month.
*   The product was well tolerated with no edema or inflammatory reaction during the treatment period.
*   The hydrogel could be easily degraded by enzymes in in vitro studies.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""A small dollop of gel, known as a 'depot,' of the semaglutide-laden hydrogel is injected under the skin,"" said Claire M√©gret, PhD, lead author of the poster presentation, in a news release. ""Our pre-clinical results demonstrate that the regular, slow release of semaglutide over one month after administering a single dose, with limited early release, is achievable,"" she added.

Primary Care Women's Health Forum

**In Anticipation of** _**Guidelines Live**_ **2024, the PCWHF Provides a Taster of its Sessions in the Women‚Äôs Health Stream, Which Will Address Key Issues Around Menopause and HRT**

A PCWHF session at _Guidelines Live_ 2023

The Primary Care Women‚Äôs Health Forum (PCWHF) is excited to return to _Guidelines Live_ in 2024, following its success delivering presentations to full lecture theatres in 2023. This year, PCWHF speaker sessions will have a primary-care relevant, practical focus, underpinned by realistic case studies to illustrate the application of guidelines in the real world.

Published in 2022, the _Women‚Äôs Health Strategy for England_ notes that there is not enough focus on women-specific issues such as menopause. Over the past few years, healthcare professionals have faced challenges such as shortages of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT), a lack of licensed options for testosterone as part of HRT, and funding for the fitting of intrauterine devices and implants that may not cover the costs of the procedure.

In the first of the PCWHF speaker sessions on Day 1, **Dr Julie Oliver**, PCWHF Chair, will discuss the recent British Menopause Society guideline on the management of unscheduled bleeding in women taking HRT. The guideline provides a new approach to risk stratification, and includes a helpful one-page summary flowchart to guide management. It also answers the perennial question ‚Äò_How high is too high?_‚Äô‚Äîthat is, what is the oestrogen dose needed to increase the amount of progestogen in an HRT regime? Dr Oliver is an NHS GP in County Durham, with an extended role in women‚Äôs health and a long history of speaking at conferences such as _Guidelines Live_.

On the Day 2 of _Guidelines Live_ 2024, **Dr Caroline Cooper** will give a contraception update, with a focus on new guidance. Dr Cooper will explore contraceptive options for women over 40 years of age, emphasising safety, efficacy, and individualised care approaches. Dr Cooper is an experienced GP with an extended role in women‚Äôs health. She is also a faculty-registered trainer, and has served on the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare committees, as well as being a current director of the PCWHF.

Next, **Dr Angela Wright** will continue the HRT theme, but adding relevance to younger women, by discussing testosterone and libido. Informed by her experience of primary and secondary care NHS work, Dr Wright‚Äôs speaker session will explain how those in primary care can support women who have complex menopause issues, sexual dysfunction, and premenstrual disorders. Dr Wright is a fellow of the European Committee of Sexual Medicine, and an active committee member of the British Society of Sexual Medicine.

### The Primary Care Women‚Äôs Health Forum

These _Guidelines Live_ sessions are supported by the Primary Care Women‚Äôs Health Forum (PCWHF), a group of 10,000 healthcare professionals with a special interest in women‚Äôs health. The PCWHF aims to promote and progress standards in women‚Äôs health in primary care through education, resources, and events, and lobbies on behalf of its members to determine future strategic direction and policymaking for women‚Äôs health.

2024-09-06 10:00:00,2024-09-11 01:47:40,"üåø Have you considered the impact of diet on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk?

- A recent study involving over 207,000 middle-aged adults from the UK Biobank found compelling evidence linking ultra-processed food consumption to increased RA risk. 
- Participants consuming the highest amounts of ultra-processed foods faced a 17% GREATER risk of developing RA compared to those in the lowest consumption group. üìä  
- Notably, this risk heightened with each incremental increase in ultra-processed food intake, suggesting a direct correlation worth considering in dietary advice. 
- Inflammatory markers, lipids, and liver enzymes accounted for up to 14.8% of this association, emphasizing the biological pathway connecting diet with autoimmune conditions. 

As we continue to explore dietary influences in clinical practice, it‚Äôs critical to advocate for reduced ultra-processed food consumption. With nearly HALF of food intake in the UK classified as ultra-processed, integrating these findings into guidelines could be pivotal in RA prevention strategies. 

What changes can we implement in dietary counseling to prioritize whole foods over ultra-processed options for our patients?  ü§î

Clinical Summary

Rheumatoid Arthritis: Whole-Food Diet May Be Protective
=======================================================

Susan London

TOPLINE:
--------

Middle-aged adults who consume more ultra-processed foods have an elevated risk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that is mediated in part through circulating biomarkers.

METHODOLOGY:¬†
-------------

*   Investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study of 207,012 middle-aged adults without RA from the UK Biobank who completed 24-hour dietary recalls.
*   Foods and beverages were classified as (1) unprocessed or minimally processed foods, (2) processed culinary ingredients, (3) processed foods, or (4) ultra-processed foods (eg, soft drinks, sweet or savoury packaged snacks, reconstituted meat products, pre-prepared frozen dishes).
*   The main outcome was the incident RA based on hospital diagnoses.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Overall, 0.9% of participants received an RA diagnosis during a median follow-up of about 12 years.
*   Relative to peers in the lowest quintile of ultra-processed food consumption, participants in the highest quintile had a 17% greater adjusted risk for RA.
*   The risk rose across quintile (P < .05) and increased by 6% with each standard deviation increase in ultra-processed food intake.
*   Mediation analyses suggested that inflammatory, lipid, and liver enzyme biomarkers explained 3.1%-14.8% of the association between ultra-processed food intake and RA risk.
*   Findings were similar regardless of participants' age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, household income, and healthy diet score.

IN PRACTICE:¬†
-------------

""Lower [ultra-processed food] consumption is recommended to reduce RA incidence,"" the authors wrote, noting that up to half of the food consumed in the United Kingdom now falls into the ultra-processed category. ""Dietary guidelines should prominently feature the detrimental effects of [ultra-processed foods], and recommendations to curtail their consumption should be integrated into public health initiatives, to mitigate the risk of RA,"" they added.

SOURCE:
-------

The study was led by Haodong Zhao, Soochow University, Suzhou, China, and was published online in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Limitations included possible recall and social desirability biases, potential residual confounding, and uncertain causality of the observed associations.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

The study was funded by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and other institutions. The authors reported no conflicts of interest.",gpt-4o-mini,T0v1p2i0MzX6hgSWrbuP
