Key takeaways:

* When a patient made a critical error in inhalation technique and/or had insufficient peak inspiratory flow, they had inhaler misuse.
* In the assessed study population, 82.3% used a minimum of one misused inhaler.

Inhaler misuse was high in hospitalized patients with COPD, with 69.4% of all inhalers at admission found to be misused, according to results published in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases: Journal of the COPD Foundation.

Ga—ël Grandmaison

‚ÄúAs a hospital physician, these findings prompt me to systematically evaluate the inhalers used by COPD patients, regardless of their reason for hospitalization,‚Äù Ga—ël Grandmaison, MD, assistant physician in internal medicine at University and Hospital of Fribourg in Switzerland, told Healio.

Data were derived from Grandmaison G, et al. Chronic Obstr Pulm Dis. 2024;doi:10.15326/jcopdf.2024.0505.

‚ÄúIn response to these findings, we have implemented a systematic and standardized assessment of inhaler use among our patients, aiming to correct inhalation techniques or replace the inhaler if necessary,‚Äù Grandmaison continued. ‚Äú[This intervention](https://smw.ch/index.php/smw/article/view/3394/5882) has significantly reduced the number of improperly used inhalers at hospital discharge.‚Äù

In a cross-sectional study, Grandmaison and colleagues evaluated 96 patients (mean age, 71.6 years; 63% men) in the internal medicine division of Fribourg Hospital with a diagnosis of COPD to find out how many patients in this population misuse inhalers via physiotherapist assessments and the In-Check Dial G16 (Alliance Tech Medical) over 9 months.

Researchers cited inhaler misuse when a patient made a critical error in inhalation technique and/or had insufficient peak inspiratory flow (PIF).

The total cohort had 160 inhalers, and nearly 70% (111 inhalers) had been misused. In the entire study population, 82.3% of patients used a minimum of one misused inhaler.

‚ÄúNumerous studies have highlighted the significant issue of improper inhaler use in outpatient settings,‚Äù Grandmaison said. ‚ÄúOur study confirms that this problem is also widespread.‚Äù

A critical error in inhalation technique was behind more instances of inhaler misuse than insufficient PIF (105 inhalers; 65.6% vs. 22 inhalers; 13.8%), and this was also reflected in the proportions of patients who used a minimum of one inhaler with a critical error (81.3%) and had insufficient PIF (21.9%).

In an effort to determine if targeted teaching can change the prevalence of inhaler misuse, researchers had physiotherapists carry out up to three teaching sessions and reassessed the number of inhalers with critical errors after each one.

With each additional session, fewer inhalers had been used with critical errors (one session, 33 inhalers; two sessions, 15 inhalers; three sessions, nine inhalers).

Five patients had cognitive disorders that inhibited them from reaching an adequate inhalation technique, according to researchers. A lack of coordination between inhaler activation and inspiration (n = 4) was another factor preventing adequate inhalation technique, followed by fine motor disorders and the inability to hold one‚Äôs breath sufficiently (each n = 2).

Researchers further assessed how many inhalers were unsuitable, meaning they ‚Äúcannot be used optimally, either because of an insufficient PIF or because of an inability to use an inhaler optimally despite specific teaching,‚Äù and found 27 (16.9%). Use of at least one unsuitable inhaler was noted in 25% of the study population.

‚ÄúSuboptimal inhaler use is associated with poor disease control, more frequent hospitalizations and increased costs,‚Äù Grandmaison told Healio. ‚ÄúThe prevalence of improperly-used inhalers is alarming, and strategies to address this issue are urgently needed.‚Äù

Among those hospitalized with a COPD exacerbation, 62.2% of the inhalers in this subgroup had been misused, whereas in the group of those hospitalized without an exacerbation, 85.7% of inhalers had been misused.

Additionally, those hospitalized for a respiratory compliant misused 65.9% of the inhalers in this subgroup, which was lower than the 82.4% of misused inhalers in the group not hospitalized for a respiratory compliant.

‚ÄúThese results underscore the critical importance of assessing inhalation technique and providing appropriate therapeutic education,‚Äù Grandmaison told Healio. ‚ÄúThey also highlight the need to evaluate a patient‚Äôs inspiratory capacity and ensure that the chosen inhaler matches their specific needs.‚Äù

With both this study and the study mentioned above on the intervention that lowered the number of improperly used inhalers at discharge completed, Grandmaison plans to continue researching the intervention.

‚ÄúThe next step is to evaluate the impact of such an intervention on symptom control and disease progression,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAdditionally, our goal is to adapt the strategy developed in our department for use in outpatient care.‚Äù

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","Groundbreaking lipid profiling uncovers how plant-based fats dramatically enhance heart and metabolic health, paving the way for precise dietary interventions.

A recent research briefing published in the journal _Nature Medicine_ reported associations between dietary fat quality and cardiometabolic risk.

The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks the evidence for the health benefits of substituting specific nutrients for others (e.g., mono- and poly-unsaturated fats for saturated fat) as low to moderate. According to the WHO, the current dietary guidelines advocating for reduced consumption of saturated fats are based on evidence of moderate certainty but remain a topic of ongoing debate.

Besides, the main drawbacks of existing intervention trials assessing different dietary fat types are shorter durations and reliance on indirect measures, e.g., cholesterol, instead of clinical endpoints (incident type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular events). Furthermore, observational studies evaluating the health outcomes of lower saturated fat intake are prone to confounding and often do not report the effects of specific nutrient substitutions.

The study and findings

In the present briefing, researchers utilized extensive blood fat composition profiling in different types of studies and observed associations between dietary fat quality and cardiometabolic risks. They combined data from dietary intervention studies that precisely controlled the types and sources of dietary fats with long-term observational studies that monitored disease occurrence over extended periods.

The researchers conducted extensive blood lipid profiling and developed/validated a multi-lipid score (MLS). The score reflected the effects of an intervention on the concentrations of 45 lipid metabolites, serving as a surrogate for metabolic adaptation to dietary fat changes. This approach allowed them to evaluate the implications of altering dietary fat quality on cardiometabolic health more precisely. The team leveraged the MLS to assess the implications of changes in the quality of dietary fats on cardiometabolic health in population studies.

Further, subgroup-specific effects were analyzed in a long-term intervention trial. The differences in MLS, which aligned with the impact of substituting saturated dairy fat with plant-based unsaturated fat, were associated with a significantly lower incidence of type 2 diabetes (in a dietary intervention trial) and cardiovascular disease (in prospective cohort studies).

Persons with initially worse MLS exhibited a stronger decrease in diabetes risk when on a Mediterranean diet rich in plant-based unsaturated fats than those with favorable MLS. This finding highlights the importance of the initial metabolic state in determining the effectiveness of dietary interventions. Substituting saturated fats from dairy products, e.g., butter, with plant-based unsaturated fats could result in substantially reduced cardiometabolic risks.

Conclusions

The study contributes important evidence supporting the current guidelines on the optimal source and quality of dietary fat but also underscores ongoing debates and limitations in the existing evidence base. The researchers addressed previous limitations of evidence underlying these guidelines by integrating randomized controlled trials and observational studies. The findings highlight the cardiometabolic benefits of replacing saturated fat from dairy products with unsaturated fat from plant products.

The authors said, ‚ÄúThe enthusiasm our work has generated encourages us to apply omics profiles for integrating data from cohorts and trials to other nutrition research questions.‚Äù However, they cautioned that their multi-study strategy is not without limitations.

While this multi-study approach addressed previous research biases, the team did not perform independent studies to establish thresholds for decision-making, examine cost-effectiveness, and validate absolute effect sizes on all metabolites. However, they cautioned that their multi-study strategy is not without limitations.

Additionally, the observed associations need validation in diverse racial and ethnic groups, as the study populations were primarily of European descent. Overall, the findings open avenues for more precise targeted interventions of dietary fat quality through lipid profiling. However, the application of lipidomics scores for dietary risk prevention requires further validation in future randomized controlled trials, particularly in more diverse populations.

===============================================================================

September 4, 2024

By Joshua Fitch, Senior Editor

Alan Percy, MD, discussed what the FDA approval of trofinetide (Daybue) has meant to patients with Rett syndrome aged 2 years and older.

Alan Percy, MD, Professor of Pediatrics, Neurology, Neurobiology, Genetics, and Psychology at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and the lead author for the LILAC-1 and LILAC-2 studies, recently discussed significant advancements in the treatment of Rett syndrome, highlighting the FDA approval of trofinetide (Daybue; Acadia Pharmaceuticals), approved on March 13, 2023. Percy also discussed the recent long-term safety data for trofinetide, based on a pair of open-label extension studies LILAC-1 and LILAC-2.

""Actually, it's quite interesting that while there is great enthusiasm among parents of children, the survival in Rett syndrome is quite long. So average survival is over age 50. So, many adult women with Rett syndrome are also taking this medication,"" Percy explained, noting the trofinetide approval marked a significant milestone in the direct management of Rett syndrome symptoms.

Percy emphasized the groundbreaking nature of this treatment, noting that ""this was the first product that was ever has been developed and approved by the FDA for direct treatment of the signs or symptoms of Rett syndrome. Other medications we use are for symptomatic care, but nothing has been available previously to direct at the basic underpinnings of Rett syndrome.""

The pivotal trial for this treatment, known as the LAVENDER trial, was a ""double-blind, placebo-controlled study lasting 12 weeks,"" Percy explained. The trial utilized the Rett Syndrome Behavioral Questionnaire (RSBQ) and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) as primary endpoints to measure the treatment's effectiveness. ""What is quite remarkable is at the end of the first pivotal trial, 12 weeks both the RSBQ and the CGI-I showed improvement.""

LILAC-1 was a 40-week, open-label extension of the LAVENDER trail and evaluated safety and efficacy of trofinetide in patients with Rett syndrome aged 5 to 21 years. LILAC-2 was a 32-month open-label extension evaluating trofinetide in females aged 5 to 22 years who had completed LILAC-1, according to Acadia Pharmaceuticals.

The most common side effects in the trials were diarrhea and vomiting.

Percy acknowledged that while the treatment shows significant promise, it is not without challenges. ""I think it is important to mention that diarrhea can be a substantial problem, and there may be individuals who have to stop the treatment simply because the diarrhea is not manageable."" However, he pointed out that strategies have been developed over time to manage this side effect more effectively. ""We start at 50% of the recommended weight-based dose, and we gradually increase to the point of maximum tolerability.""

Vaxcyte, Inc has announced positive topline results from its Phase 1/2 study of VAX-31, a 31-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) candidate. The study, which involved 1,015 adults aged 50 and older, found that VAX-31 was well tolerated and elicited strong opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) immune responses for all 31 serotypes evaluated. Notably, VAX-31 met or exceeded regulatory immunogenicity standards for all 31 serotypes at middle and high doses, showing significant improvements over Prevnar 20 (PCV20) for several serotypes.

‚ÄúWe are exceptionally proud to share these results, which we believe validate VAX-31‚Äôs potential as a best-in-class pneumococcal vaccine capable of raising the bar for immunogenicity standards,‚Äù said Jim Wassil, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Vaxcyte. ‚ÄúThe public health community continues to highlight the need for broader-protection vaccines to prevent IPD, which is associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and meningitis. To address this need, VAX-31 was designed to increase coverage to more than 95% of IPD circulating in adults 50 and older in the United States, with the potential to provide significantly greater coverage relative to today‚Äôs standard-of-care adult PCVs.‚Äù1

### Main Takeaways

1.  Vaxcyte‚Äôs VAX-31 vaccine showed strong immune responses and was well tolerated in a Phase 1/2 study of 1,015 adults aged 50 and older.
2.  VAX-31 met or exceeded immunogenicity standards for all 31 serotypes and demonstrated superior responses compared to Prevnar 20 for several serotypes.
3.  Vaxcyte plans to advance VAX-31 to a Phase 3 trial by mid-2025 and initiate a Phase 2 infant study to offer broader protection against pneumococcal disease.

The randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding study compared three dosage levels of VAX-31 to PCV20, assessing its safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity over six months. Results showed that VAX-31 at the high and middle doses met non-inferiority criteria for all 20 common serotypes with PCV20, and demonstrated statistically superior immune responses for several serotypes. The vaccine also met superiority criteria for 11 additional serotypes unique to VAX-31.

[Back in February](https://www.contagionlive.com/view/vaxcyte-completes-enrollment-for-its-phase-1-2-trial-for-innovative-pneumococcal-vaccine-vax-31), Vaxcyte completed enrollment for the Phase 1/2 trial of VAX-31, a 31-valent PCV designed to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The randomized, observer-blind, dose-finding study, which involves 1,015 participants, is evaluating three dosage levels of VAX-31 compared to PCV20.

Streptococcus pneumoniae causes PD, leads to severe infections such as meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia. It results in around 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the US The World Health Organization and the CDC classify Streptococcus pneumoniae as a top antibiotic-resistant threat. It is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in children under five and causes over 50% of bacterial meningitis cases in the US The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains highlights the urgent need for a more effective vaccine.

Looking ahead, Vaxcyte plans to advance VAX-31 into a Phase 3 program, with a pivotal non-inferiority study set to begin by mid-2025. Additionally, a Phase 2 study of VAX-31 in infants is planned for early 2025. VAX-31 aims to provide broader protection against pneumococcal disease, potentially covering more than 95% of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) strains in adults. As a novel 31-valent PCV, it represents a significant advancement in pneumococcal vaccination, seeking to enhance coverage and efficacy beyond current standard vaccines.

[FDA Briefs|September 2024 Brief](https://www.targetedonc.com/fda-briefs/september-2024-brief)

The FDA has approved FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx as companion diagnostics to be used with olaparib, abiraterone, and prednisone or prednisolone BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Two prostate cancer cells in the final stage of cell division: ¬©PRB ARTS - stock.adobe.com

*   **The FDA has approved the FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx as companion diagnostics for the combination of olaparib (Lynparza) and abiraterone (Zytiga) with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with _BRCA_\-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).**
*   **This approval follows 2 previous approvals of the FoundationOne CDx as companion diagnostics for olaparib in mCRPC.**
*   **The availability of tissue- and liquid-based diagnostic tools provides greater access to genomic testing for patients.**

The FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx have been approved by the FDA for companion use with olaparib, abiraterone, and prednisone or prednisolone in patients with _BRCA_\-mutated mCRPC.1

‚ÄúThis approval reinforces the importance of testing for genomic mutations at metastatic diagnosis to help guide treatment decisions,‚Äù said Mia Levy, MD, PhD, chief medical officer at Foundation Medicine, in a press release. ‚ÄúOur high-quality tissue and liquid biopsy companion diagnostic tests will allow more patients to access genomic testing, regardless of specimen type, and will simplify complex decisions by generating the best information to enable better decision-making. There is a critical unmet need for first-line treatment options for patients with _BRCA_\-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and this combination therapy is an important advancement.‚Äù

This approval marks Foundation Medicine‚Äôs seventh FDA-approved companion diagnostic in prostate cancer. In May 2020, the FDA approved the FoundationOne CDx in patients with homologous recombination repair gene-mutated mCRPC who had progressed following treatment with enzalutamide (Xtandi) or abiraterone.2 In November 2020, the [**Liquid CDx was approved as a companion diagnostic**](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/foundationone-liquid-cdx-receives-expanded-fda-indication-in-metastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer) for olaparib to identify patients with mCRPC harboring _BRCA1, BRCA2_, or _ATM_ alterations.3

The FoundationOne companion diagnostics can analyze over 300 cancer-related genes using either blood or tissue samples. The approval of both tissue- and blood-based diagnostic tools provides greater access and flexibility for patients to benefit from genomic testing, particularly with the poor prognosis associated with _BRCA_\-mutated mCRPC.1

‚ÄúThis is an important milestone for men with aggressive prostate cancer,‚Äù said Courtney Bugler, president and chief executive officer of ZERO Prostate Cancer, in the press release. ‚ÄúBiomarker testing is an important tool for patients and families to help facilitate personalized treatment decision making, and we applaud Foundation Medicine for these additional companion diagnostic indications.‚Äù

==========================================================================

With 1k new patients a month, the company has almost quadrupled its revenue in one year
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UK-based healthtech Doccla has secured a ¬£35m Series B, led by European VC Lakestar, with new investors French VC Elaia and existing investors General Catalyst, Speedinvest and the investment leg of German media company Bertelsmann also participating.

Having almost quadrupled its annual revenue in 2023, it's planning its expansion in DACH and France, and says its German and French investors will help its international growth plans.

The startup, founded in 2019, makes ‚Äúvirtual ward‚Äù technology for healthcare providers. It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.

Doccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland‚Äôs Health Service Executive (HSE).

Doccla‚Äôs founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.

‚ÄúWith the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it‚Äôs a huge opportunity to scale,‚Äù says Ratz.

#### The virtual A&E

Sweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.

According to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.

Patients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.

So far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it‚Äôs adding 1k new patients every month.

‚ÄúOver time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,‚Äù Ratz says.

#### Partnering with pharma

Doccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).

‚ÄúWe have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,‚Äù Ratz says. ‚ÄúThis is because we are in very close contact with our patients.‚Äù

Doccla says it‚Äôs interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he‚Äôs seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.

With 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.

In one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.

‚ÄúWe can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits ‚Äî in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,‚Äù Ratz says.

Doccla has raised a total of ¬£52m to date.

In October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.",gpt-4o-mini

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","Berlin-based Caresyntax, which is building an AI-driven data platform for surgery, has raised a $180m Series C extension.

The round is made up of $80m in equity and $100m in debt ‚Äî and is tied to specific milestones. The fresh funding tops up the startup‚Äôs $130m Series C, raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.

It‚Äôs the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.

Caresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.

### AI for hospitals

Caresyntax says it wants to build the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals‚Äô surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.

The company‚Äôs platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.

While some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax‚Äôs platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.

‚ÄúEffectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,‚Äù they add.

If it does what it sets out to do, it‚Äôs a big opportunity.

Costs associated with operations account for 30% of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends 11% of GDP on health.

Founded in 2013 in Germany ‚Äî Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 ‚Äî its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company‚Äôs revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.

### The rise of smart surgery

The round comes on the back of a strong 18 months for startups developing tech for the operating theatre.

Since the start of 2023, three of the four biggest medtech raises have all gone to startups building robots to help surgeons. The UK‚Äôs CMR Surgical picked up ¬£165m in September last year, Switzerland‚Äôs DistalMotion $150m in April 2023 and Italy‚Äôs Medical Microinstruments $110m in February this year.

For more details, read the full study here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407791","The meteoric rise of a new class of weight loss drugs over the past two years, known as GLP-1s, has seen a new name take the title of Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, helped a country dodge a recession and hit grocery sales in the US.

The valuations of the companies that make this so-called ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù class of drugs ‚Äî which includes Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and US rival Eli Lilly (maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) ‚Äî have soared as investors bet big on a medication projected by some to hit $150bn in sales by the early 2030s.

The potential of the market has not been lost on founders.

It‚Äôs a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù opportunity, says Kai Eberhardt, the founder and CEO of Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform which operates in the UK, France and Germany, alongside its home market. It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.

‚ÄúFor us [GLP-1 drugs] are already a strong growth driver,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.‚Äù

While treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva‚Äôs overall business ‚Äî Eberhardt says it‚Äôs growing total patient and revenue numbers by ‚Äúdouble digit‚Äù percentage points year-on-year ‚Äî the meds could become the startup‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest‚Äù growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.

### Riding the wave

Oviva‚Äôs not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity ‚Äî many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.

In the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart‚Äôs CEO, food sales have fallen as the one in eight adults in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe‚Äôs most valuable company, propping up Denmark‚Äôs GDP in the process.

All of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have convinced them to get out their chequebook: Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a ‚Ç¨10m Series A in August 2023 a year on from a ‚Ç¨3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised ‚Ç¨3.1m last summer.

Many startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn‚Äôt start life offering them ‚Äî largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.

UK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs health‚Äù brand, but has recently changed that. The company‚Äôs website uses images of men and women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.

Yazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.

Meurling tells Sifted it had hit ‚Ç¨14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It‚Äôs now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.

Other startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men‚Äôs sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.

‚Äú[GLP-1 meds] are a game changer,‚Äù says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be ‚Äústrange‚Äù if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn‚Äôt looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.

While GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the ‚Äúhype‚Äù surrounding the drug class has ‚Äúopened doors‚Äù for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler ‚Äî adding that the startup managed to raise its ‚Ç¨400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It‚Äôs now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it‚Äôll look to target US employers ‚Äî who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.

### Kinks in the supply chain

There are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector ‚Äî not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.

Some of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate‚Äôs $100m in 2021 and Form Health‚Äôs $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than ‚Ç¨10m in a single round.

Investors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics ‚Äî Manual was still selling past the deadline.

If a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.

‚ÄúAs there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.‚Äù

### Who‚Äôll stump up the cash?

There‚Äôs also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.

While Numan‚Äôs head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the ‚Äúsuccess of private sector companies offering GLP-1 [drugs] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS‚Äù, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won‚Äôt be enough to hit real scale.

‚ÄúUS investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts [selling to whole organisations like health insurers],‚Äù says Syhler. ‚ÄúThis means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care ‚Äî where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.‚Äù

In Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.

In the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.

Oviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS ‚Äî but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it‚Äôs in ‚Äúmature dialogues with several health systems‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,‚Äù says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that don‚Äôt always want to work with startups. Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.

Whether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen ‚Äî but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. ‚ÄúI've never been an investor in a company that‚Äôs got so much attention ‚Äî in a space that‚Äôs got so much attention,‚Äù says Arnardottir.",gpt-4o-mini

On Wednesday UK-based period tracking app Flo Health announced it had raised $200m ‚Äî pushing its valuation beyond $1bn and making it Europe‚Äôs first femtech unicorn.

It turned out to be a very buzzy story: as people were quick to point out online, Flo also became Europe‚Äôs first women‚Äôs health unicorn with an all-male founding team ‚Äî a detail which sparked a backlash online.

‚ÄúA company founded by men, led by men and funded by men became the first WOMEN'S health app to achieve unicorn status. If this doesn't show you everything that's wrong with the ecosystem, I don't know what will,‚Äù Anna-Sophie Hartvigsen, cofounder of investment learning app and community for women Female Invest, wrote in a viral LinkedIn post, citing stats on the lack of funding for female founders. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad that a femtech company is doing well,‚Äù she later added in the comments. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs bad that only men are able to succeed in this space.‚Äù

Some founders in the comments underneath Hartvigsen's post said that they‚Äôve struggled with fundraising as a woman; there was also a debate in a private WhatsApp group seen by Sifted about whether female founders should add a token male founder to their team in an effort to increase their chances of getting cheques. Someone in that group added that we won‚Äôt fix the trend of men funding men until there are more female investors.

But others didn‚Äôt see it that way.

‚ÄúThis achievement should actually be celebrated. As a women's health investor that has invested in 7+ women's health companies, we are yet to see any of them scale,‚Äù Deepali Nangia, a partner at Speedinvest, wrote in response to Hartvigsen‚Äôs LinkedIn post. ‚ÄúFlo's achievement is a very strong signal to the market that [direct to consumer] women's health is monetizable in Europe and that there is money to be made here; this is what investors need to see so more money flows into women's health companies. Not to say that the challenges faced by women in pitching are any less, but we must celebrate all wins that lead to more capital deployed into this sector,‚Äù she argued.

Nangia added that she wasn‚Äôt doubting there‚Äôs a problem, ‚Äúbut every win should not be turned around to a problem‚Ä¶ Many people have been working on solving for this problem, which includes many women of course but also men.‚Äù

Another commenter added: ‚ÄúIf anything, let this be a door for more investors to look closely at the female health industry and invest their money there? Could this be an example of men allies? If it had to be a company founded and led by men, well thank you very much for opening the door, now let the rest go through.‚Äù

Priya Oberoi, partner at women‚Äôs health-focused VC Goddess Gaia Ventures, added: ‚ÄúFlo reaching series C [unicorn] status with 60 mln active users is a win for #womenshealth - helping to close that 131 year gender health gap and getting products and services out there to improve the lives of women.‚Äù

""We firmly believe that women's health has been critically overlooked, undervalued and underfunded for far too long,"" Flo said in a statement to Sifted. ""Our sincere hope is that Flo‚Äôs funding will inspire more investors to recognise the immense potential in this space."" The company added: ""We're proud to say that more than half (56%) of Flo's employees are women, including our leadership team.""

It‚Äôs an important debate, and, readers, I‚Äôm curious to hear your thoughts: why aren‚Äôt there more female-founded femtech unicorns?

METHODOLOGY:
------------

* Investigators conducted a prospective cohort study among 61 general practitioners (GPs) in France, most of whom had not previously used the MoCA.
* The GPs administered the test to 221 patients aged 50 years and older (mean age, 66 years) without known impairment during routine consultations.
* The main outcome was MoCA feasibility, defined as completion in less than 15 minutes, the average time required to complete the alternate Mini Mental State Examination.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

* On an average, the GPs completed MoCA administration in just 8 minutes (range, 5-30 minutes).
* Fully, 82% of the tests were completed in 10 minutes and 97% in less than 15 minutes.
* On the basis of MoCA score, 62% of screened patients had mild cognitive impairment (18-25 points) and 4% had moderate cognitive impairment (10-17 points), while the rest had normal cognition.
* Most GPs reported that using the MoCA was a positive experience, in particular noting that it was easy and quick to use in daily practice.
* GP difficulties with the test were related to patient hearing loss, whereas patient difficulties were related to lack of concentration leading to misunderstanding of instructions.

IN PRACTICE:
------------

""This study confirms the quick and easy MoCA use during routine consultations in general practice to screen for early cognitive impairment from the age of 50,"" the authors wrote. The high prevalence of mild cognitive impairment found highlights ""the importance of early screening to promote early support for patients and their entourage,"" they added.

SOURCE:
-------

The study was led by Cassandre Carton, MD, University of Lille, Lille, France, and was published online in BJGP Open.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Limitations included the low participation rate, a lack of in-depth exploration of GPs' views of the MoCA, and administration of the test at a consultation selected by the GP.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

The study did not receive any funding. The authors reported no competing interests.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

A recent study found higher incidences of exposed bone and osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer who underwent dental extractions soon after radiotherapy, with the risk particularly elevated in those who received higher radiation doses.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Guidelines recommend removing nonrestorable teeth before radiation therapy to prevent osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer, but this can delay treatment by 2-4 weeks, potentially affecting overall survival. An alternative is to perform extractions after radiation, with a caveat that radiation can affect patients' oral health following an extraction.
*   Prospective data assessing outcomes among patients receiving extractions soon after radiation therapy ‚Äî when complications may be more minimal ‚Äî don't exist.
*   Researchers evaluated the safety of performing dental extractions within 4 months of radiation therapy and the associated risks for exposed bone and osteoradionecrosis.
*   The study included 50 patients with head and neck cancer, enrolled from January 2020 to September 2022.
*   The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of exposed bone; secondary outcomes were the incidence of osteoradionecrosis and adherence to recommended post-radiation extractions. The median follow-up period was 26 months.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   A total of 30 patients had between 1 and 28 extractions at a median of 64.5 days (range, 13-152 days) after therapy, while 20 patients declined extractions. Out of those who had extractions, 26 patients had them performed within the recommended 4-month window following radiation therapy.
*   Among all patients, 13 experienced an exposed bone event, 12 of which occurred in patients who had post-radiation extractions; 8 of 13 patients with exposed bone were later diagnosed with osteoradionecrosis.
*   The 2-year cumulative incidences of exposed bone were 27%, 40%, and 7% among all patients, those who underwent extractions, and those who declined extractions, respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidences of osteoradionecrosis were 18%, 23%, and 7% among all patients, those who underwent extractions, and those who declined extractions, respectively.
*   Among patients who received post-radiation extractions, a mean oral cavity dose ‚â• 35 Gy was associated with greater risk for exposed bone at 2 years (58%) and osteoradionecrosis (39%). An average mandible dose ‚â• 31.5 Gy produced similar results.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

Post-radiation extractions, even when performed soon after the completion of radiation therapy, are ""unsuitable for routine use,"" particularly at high oral cavity or mandibular doses, given the risk for exposed bone and osteoradionecrosis, the authors concluded.

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study, with Matthew C. Ward, MD, from Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Charlotte, North Carolina, was [published online](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2822270?) in _JAMA Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead & Neck Surgery_.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

The study had a small sample size, limited generalizability, and a short follow-up. Confounding factors could have affected the results.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The study funding source was not declared. Several authors received grants and personal fees outside this work.

TOPLINE:
--------

For people aged 75 years or older experiencing non‚ÄìST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), an invasive treatment strategy may not be better than a conservative one for a composite of cardiovascular death and non-fatal myocardial infarction.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   Prospective, multicenter, randomised SENIOR-RITA trial in the United Kingdom.
*   About 1518 patients aged ‚â• 75 years with NSTEMI were randomly assigned to the conservative strategy (best medical care) vs the invasive strategy (coronary angiography and revascularisation plus best medical care).
*   Frail patients and those with comorbidities were included.
*   The outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   Median follow-up was 4.1 years.
*   There were no significant between-group differences in the primary outcome or cardiovascular death between the invasive strategy group and the conservative strategy group.
*   However, non-fatal myocardial infarction occurred in 11.7% of the invasive strategy group and 15.0% of the conservative strategy group, a significant difference (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-0.99).
*   In addition, over a 5-year period, invasive treatment resulted in, on average, 29 more days free from cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction than with conservative treatment.

IN PRACTICE:
------------

""Using contemporary angiography and interventional strategies, with the radial artery used as the access site in 89.3% of the patients, bleeding and procedure-related complications were minimal,"" the authors wrote.

SOURCE:
-------

The study was conducted by a UK-based team and was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

LIMITATIONS:
------------

Recruitment fell short of the goal of 1668 participants, with four in five screened participants not entering the trial. There were fewer outcome events than expected.

DISCLOSURES:
------------

The study was funded by the British Heart Foundation.

- A comprehensive study involving over 39,000 women aged 45+ years reveals no link between a history of migraine and an elevated risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD) over a follow-up of up to 22 years.
- Of the 685 women diagnosed with PD during this period, only 18.7% had a history of migraine, while 81.3% did not. This prompts a critical reflection on how we perceive the relationship between different health conditions.
- Importantly, migraine subtypes (with or without aura) and frequency did not correlate with PD risk, suggesting that women with migraines can feel reassured about their condition concerning Parkinson's risk.

As healthcare providers, we must continuously update our understanding of overlapping conditions. This study not only alleviates concerns for patients with migraines but also highlights the need for careful diagnosis and consideration of individual health histories.

**TOPLINE:**
------------

A history of migraine is not associated with an elevated risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) in women, regardless of headache frequency or migraine subtype, a new study suggests.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   Researchers analyzed data on 39,312 women health professionals aged ‚â• 45 years and having no history of PD who enrolled in the Women's Health Study between 1992 and 1995 and were followed until 2021.
*   At baseline, 7321 women (18.6%) had migraine.
*   The mean follow-up duration was 22 years.
*   The primary outcome was a self-reported, physician-confirmed diagnosis of PD.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   During the study period, 685 women self-reported a diagnosis of PD.
*   Of these, 18.7% of reported cases were in women with any migraine and 81.3% in women without migraine.
*   No significant association was found between PD risk and a history of migraine, migraine subtypes (with or without aura), or migraine frequency.
*   Migraine was not associated with a higher risk for PD than nonmigraine headaches.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""These results are reassuring for women who have migraine, which itself causes many burdens, that they don't have to worry about an increased risk of Parkinson's disease in the future,"" study author Tobias Kurth, Charit√© - Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, said in a [press release](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1054724%3F).

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study was led by Ricarda S. Schulz, MSc, Charit√© - Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin. It was [published online](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209747) on August 21 in _Neurology_.

**LIMITATIONS:**
----------------

The study's findings may not be generalizable to other populations, such as men and non-White individuals. The self-reported data on migraine and PD may be subject to inaccuracies. PD is often not diagnosed until symptoms have reached an advanced stage, potentially leading to cases being underreported. Changes in the status and frequency of migraine over the study period were not accounted for, which may have affected the results.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The authors did not disclose any specific funding for this work. The Women's Health Study was supported by the National Cancer Institute and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Two authors reported having financial ties outside this work. Full disclosures are available in the original article.
