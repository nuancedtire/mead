- Researchers highlight **plectasin** as a breakthrough in antibiotic design by targeting **lipid II**—a key component in bacterial cell walls. 
- This antibiotic binds lipid II to **form complex supramolecular structures**, enhancing its effectiveness against **gram-positive** bacteria, while limiting resistance development. 
- Unlike conventional antimicrobials that rely on electrostatic interactions, plectasin’s action is **highly specific**—a game changer in the fight against infections. 
- **Calcium's role** in modulating this mechanism was a surprising discovery, suggesting deeper biochemical interactions yet to be explored. 
- Although clinical development was abruptly halted, the study beckons a reevaluation of the focus on **target binding and oligomerization** in antibiotic design.

[Markus Weingarth](https://www.weingarth-group.net/), a biochemist at Utrecht University, considers lipid II, a building block of bacteria cell walls, one of the most promising antibiotic targets. Human cells don’t produce it — so targeting it avoids toxicity — and bacteria struggle to develop resistance against it.

His research group recently published a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01696-9) in _Nature Microbiology_, in which they reported that the antibiotic plectasin binds lipid II by forming dense structures on bacterial membranes (1). The findings improve researchers’ understanding of how lipid II binding disrupts the cell walls of bacteria, which can help them develop better antibiotics.

Novozyme’s scientists first [described](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1185723?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) plectasin’s mechanism of action in 2010 (2). However, in their experiments, they used artificial membranes called micelles and showed that each plectasin molecule paired with one lipid II molecule. However, micelles do not accurately mimic the membrane environment. “We took a gamble, believing that what happened in micelles was not the real deal, and this turned out to be the case,” said Weingarth. In biological membranes, the team found that plectasin formed massive supramolecular structures upon lipid II binding. “We saw that the supramolecular mechanism was not the exception, but rather the rule among the lipid II binders.”

**How is plectasin’s mechanism of action different from that of other antibiotics?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conventional antimicrobial peptides selectively bind bacteria based on electrostatics, as bacterial membranes are negatively charged while human cell membranes are positively charged. This electrostatic interaction is fairly unspecific. However, plectasin targets lipid II specifically based on both structure and charge, making it a highly selective target binder. This specificity marks its first major difference. Most drugs follow a conventional ""one drug, one target"" mechanism, where the drug and the target interact directly. In contrast, plectasin and other lipid II binders form massive supramolecular structures upon target binding. This formation is not just a feature but a critical aspect of the mechanism. Without these superstructures, there would be no stable target binding. These two prominent features of plectasin — highly specific interaction with the target and supramolecular recognition — distinguish it from conventional antimicrobial peptides.

The other thing that stands out about plectasin’s mechanism is that it is calcium modulated, which was an unexpected discovery. In hindsight, it seems obvious given the presence of a large ionic pocket that naturally binds calcium. However, this aspect had not been mentioned in any previous publications on plectasin.

**What makes lipid II a good antibiotic target?**
-------------------------------------------------

Lipid II has fatty acid tails and a pyrophosphate head group, which bacteria cannot alter. There are no known cases of bacteria replacing the pyrophosphate group for peptidoglycan synthesis, making it an absolute bottleneck for their cell wall biosynthesis. However, bacteria might be able to develop indirect resistance mechanisms, such as making the target inaccessible. They could make the peptidoglycan layer so dense that the drug never reaches the target. This is energy-intensive and unstable. Additionally, bacteria cannot make more lipid II once it’s captured, so targeting lipid II at these immutable sites makes it difficult for bacteria to develop stable resistance mechanisms.

> We saw that the supramolecular mechanism was not the exception, but rather the rule among the lipid II binders.   
> – Markus Weingarth, Utrecht University

**How effective is plectasin as an antibiotic?**
------------------------------------------------

Plectasin is not effective against gram-negative bacteria because it cannot overcome their outer membrane. However, plectasin is highly efficient against gram-positive bacteria and maintains this effectiveness in animal models of infection. Despite its potential as a relevant therapeutic, I am pessimistic about its future because the clinical development of plectasin was discontinued, and the work was never published. However, plectasin ticks many important boxes: It is stable in serum, non-cytotoxic, and highly efficient against a broad range of superbugs, including in animal models of infection, making it a compelling clinical candidate.

Although plectasin’s future as a therapeutic is uncertain, the study’s findings have significant implications for the design of lipid II-binding antibiotics. It’s crucial to optimize both the part of the drug that binds the target and the part responsible for oligomerization. This aspect has been ignored so far, as the focus has traditionally been on target binding alone. However, target binding and oligomerization are strongly interdependent. Only when both are optimized can ideal target binding occur.

*   The authorization is supported by positive data from a phase 3 pivotal trial.
*   Avanzanite Bioscience has exclusive rights to market Akantior in 26 countries in Europe.

The European Commission granted marketing authorization to Akantior for the treatment of _A__canthamoeba_ [keratitis](https://www.healio.com/news/ophthalmology/20240304/video-oxygen-does-not-play-a-role-in-crosslinking-for-infectious-keratitis), according to a press release from Avanzanite Bioscience.

The decision was backed by positive results from the phase 3 pivotal Orphan Drug for _Acanthamoeba_ Keratitis (ODAK) trial, which included 135 patients. Of these patients, 84.8% were cured of _A__canthamoeba_ keratitis (AK) after treatment with Akantior (polyhexanide, Avanzanite Bioscience). In addition, 66.7% of patients achieved full vision restoration without the need for optical [cornea transplants](https://www.healio.com/news/ophthalmology/20240718/blog-choose-the-transplantsaving-path).

     ![Image 5: Generic Breaking News infographic](https://www.healio.com/~/media/slack-news/generic-infographics/2023/generic-breaking-news.jpg?w=800)

The European Commission granted marketing authorization to Akantior for the treatment of _Acanthamoeba_ keratitis.  
  

According to the release, the drug is the first and only authorized medicinal treatment for AK globally. It previously received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a positive recommendation from the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products.

Akantior is the second rare disease medicine commercialized by Avanzanite, which has secured exclusive rights to commercialize the treatment in 26 countries in Europe.

“This marketing authorization is the beginning of a new chapter for the treatment of _A__canthamoeba_ keratitis and a monumental victory for AK patients in Europe,” **Adam Plich,** founder and CEO of Avanzanite Bioscience, said in the release. “At Avanzanite, we are committed to supporting broad access to our innovative therapies and look forward to collaborating with local health authorities in 26 European countries to secure sustainable access agreements so we can save the eyes of as many eligible patients as possible.”

2024-08-29 08:17:00,2024-08-30 00:14:10,"✨ Key Insights on SGLT-2 Inhibitors and Dementia Prevention:

- **Research Overview**: A significant study from Korea suggests SGLT-2 inhibitors, commonly used for type 2 diabetes, may decrease dementia risk, especially with prolonged use.
  
- **Findings**: 
  - 35% reduced risk of dementia when compared to DPP-4 inhibitors. 
  - Specific reductions: 39% for Alzheimer's and 52% for vascular dementia. 

- **Duration Matters**: Longer treatment (over 2 years) corresponds to a 48% reduction in dementia risk.

- **Demographic Focus**: This large observational study tracked 110,885 adults aged 40-69, highlighting a need for more randomized controlled trials to confirm results.

- **Clinical Recommendations**: As dementia rates rise globally, it's crucial to rethink clinical guidelines and policies to include these possible benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors. 

The compelling potential for these medications emphasizes the need for continuous discussion on their roles in a broader clinical context.

Title: Certain diabetes drugs might prevent dementia

URL Source: https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1055806

Markdown Content:
Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors used to treat type 2 diabetes might prevent dementia, providing greater benefits with longer treatment, suggests a large study from Korea published by _The BMJ_ today.

As this study was observational, the researchers note that the effect size could have been overestimated and say randomised controlled trials are now needed to confirm these findings.

According to the World Health Organization, the number of people with dementia globally is expected to reach 78 million by 2030 and type 2 diabetes is associated with a greater risk of developing dementia.

A recent study of over 65s with type 2 diabetes suggested a decreased risk of dementia associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors versus another type of diabetes drug, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. But the effects on younger people and specific types of dementia (eg, Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia) remains unclear.

To address this, researchers used the Korea National Health Insurance Service database to identify 110,885 pairs of adults with type 2 diabetes aged 40-69 years who were free of dementia and started taking either an SGLT-2 inhibitor or a DPP-4 inhibitor between 2013 and 2021.

All participants (average age 62; 56% men) were matched by age, sex, use of the diabetes drug metformin, and baseline cardiovascular risk and were followed up for an average of 670 days to see who developed dementia.

Potentially influential factors including personal characteristics, income level, underlying risk factors for dementia, other conditions and related medicine use, were also taken into account.

Over the follow-up period, a total of 1,172 participants with newly diagnosed dementia were identified.

Dementia rates per 100 person years were 0.22 for those using SGLT-2 inhibitors and 0.35 for those using DPP-4 inhibitors, corresponding to a 35% reduced risk of dementia associated with use of SGLT-2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors.

The researchers also found a 39% reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease, and a 52% reduced risk for vascular dementia associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors.

What’s more, the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors seemed more pronounced with longer treatment duration. A 48% reduced risk of dementia was seen for more than two years of treatment versus a 43% reduced risk for two years or less.

This is an observational study so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, and the authors note that details of health behaviours (eg, smoking and alcohol consumption) and duration of type 2 diabetes were not fully available.

However, they point out that this was a large study based on nationally representative data that included relatively younger people with type 2 diabetes, and results were highly consistent across subgroups.

As such, they say SGLT-2 inhibitors might prevent dementia, providing greater benefits with longer treatment, and they call for randomised controlled trials to confirm these findings.

This study reports promising results that have important implications for clinical practice as well as from a public health perspective, say researchers from Taiwan in a linked editorial.

They agree that further trials are needed to confirm these findings, and suggest that studies are also needed “to explore the underlying mechanisms of any neuroprotective effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors.”

As no cure currently exists for dementia and few effective treatment options are available, strategies that can potentially prevent onset are critically important, they write.

Given the substantial socioeconomic and public health burdens associated with both dementia and type 2 diabetes, they also recommend that clinical guidelines and healthcare policies should be updated regularly to incorporate latest best evidence on the potential benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors, including reduced dementia risk.

New research has found associations between a number of metabolites and the risk of incident [hospitalized gout](https://www.hcplive.com/view/new-research-molybdenum-ward-off-hyperuricemia-gout).1

“Our objective was to prospectively investigate pre-diagnostic population-based metabolome for risk of hospitalized gout (i.e., most accurate, severe, and costly cases), accounting for serum urate,” lead investigator Natalie McCormick, PhD, instructor in medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and Arthritis Research Canada, Vancouver, Canada, and colleagues wrote.1

McCormick and colleagues analyzed pre-diagnostic metabolomes of 249,677 United Kingdom Biobank participants from baseline blood samples collected from 2006 to 2010 without a history of gout. They conducted NMR metabolomic profiling, looking at 168 metabolites, including 8 amino acids. After multivariable adjustment, they calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for incident hospitalized gout, before and after adjusting for serum urate levels, and also analyzed non-hospitalized incident gout cases in a sensitivity analysis. They used 2-sample Mendelian randomization to evaluate potential causal effects.1

The investigators found that after correcting for multiple testing, 107 metabolites were associated with the incidence of hospitalized gout (N=2735) before urate adjustment. These included glycine (HR, 0.64 \[95% CI, 0.54-0.75\]; _P_ \= 8.3x10-8) and glutamine (HR, 0.69 \[95% CI, 0.61-0.78\]; _P_ \= 3.3x10-9) inversely,between extreme quintiles, and glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA; HR, 2.48 \[95% CI, 2.15-2.87\]; _P_ \= 1.96x10-34). After adjusting for urates, the associations remained significant and directionally consistent, with respective HRs of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.98), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.76-0.98), and 1.41 (95% CI, 1.21-1.63) between extreme quintiles, with corresponding HRs per standard deviations of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.86-0.97), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98), and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.06-1.14).1

Sensitivity analyses including non-hospitalized incident gout cases corroborated the potential causal role of these metabolites on hyperuricemia or gout risk, with Mendelian randomization showing a change in urate levels of -0.05 mg/dL (-0.08, -0.01) per SD of glycine and a change of -0.12 mg/dL (-0.22, -0.03)per SD of glutamine. Accordingly, odds ratios per SD were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.88-1.00) for glycine and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.67-0.97) for gout.1

“These prospective findings with causal implications could lead to biomarker-based risk prediction and potential supplementation-based interventions with glycine or glutamine,” McCormick and colleagues concluded.1

Other recent research on urates found that circulating uric acid have a potential role in [accelerating biological aging](https://www.hcplive.com/view/uric-acid-levels-pose-potential-harm-in-accelerating-biological-aging) among older adults. Investigators found that uric acid levels increased as frailty severity increased from non-frail to frail (_P_ \= .002). Frail adults presented with greater serum uric acid levels than non-frail adults (_P_ \= .002).

After adjusting for age, sex, and other comorbidities, investigators found serum uric acid levels were significantly greater in frail participants than in non-frail participants (_P_ < .001). The study showed serum uric acid concentrations were positively correlated to the frail index (_P_ < .001). Moreover, per 1 mg/dL increase in serum uric acid, the odds for frailty were 1.22 (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 1.12 – 1.33; _P_ < .001), and the risks were 25% and 22% as shown in the age- and sex-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted models, respectively (_P_ < .001).

“These results clinically underscore the potential of circulating \[uric acid\] as a pro-aging factor rather than an anti-aging one in this demographic,” wrote investigators, led by Min-gu Kang, from Chonnam National University Bitgoeul Hospital in South Korea.2 “Moreover, this research adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests serum UA could serve as a potential blood-based biomarker for detecting frailty in older adults.”

2024-08-28 06:41:00,2024-08-30 00:14:43,"🔍 **Recent Findings on Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's**  
- A new study reveals that individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) are about **50% less likely** to have amyloid-beta plaques, markers associated with Alzheimer’s disease.  
- Researchers suggest that biological or genetic factors of MS may provide some protective benefits against Alzheimer’s.  
- This could be significant as the same patients often experience cognitive issues that overlap with Alzheimer's symptoms.  
- Understanding what aspects of MS offer protection could guide future therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer’s disease.

People with [multiple sclerosis](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/) (MS) are about half as likely as those without the disease to have signs of the amyloid-beta plaques in the brain that are a hallmark of [Alzheimer’s disease](https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/what-is-alzheimers-disease/), according to a study in the U.S.

“Our findings imply that some component of the biology of multiple sclerosis, or the genetics of MS patients, is protective against Alzheimer’s disease,” Matthew Brier, MD, PhD, the study’s first author and an assistant professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said in a [university news story](https://d.newswise.com/articles/multiple-sclerosis-appears-to-protect-against-alzheimer-s-disease).

The reason behind the link remains unknown.

The study, “[Unexpected Low Rate of Amyloid-\[beta\] Pathology in Multiple Sclerosis Patients](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27027),” was published as a brief communication in the _Annals of Neurology_.

In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks [myelin](http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/), the fatty sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, causing [symptoms](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/) such as muscle weakness, poor vision, and numbness. It also can cause cognitive problems, including memory loss. These symptoms could be confused with symptoms of Alzheimer’s, the most common cause of dementia.

[### Crying at Donald Duck, and other strange emotional reactions](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/columns/chairborne-a-column-by-ben-hofmeister/2024/08/08/crying-donald-duck-other-strange-emotional-reactions/)

### Seeking a link between MS and Alzheimer’s risk

Anne Cross, MD, an MS specialist at the university, found it interesting that her patients rarely developed Alzheimer’s, even though they were old enough to be at risk for it.

“I noticed that I couldn’t find a single MS patient of mine who had typical Alzheimer’s disease,” Cross said. “If they had cognitive problems, I would send them to the memory and aging specialists here at WashU Medicine for an Alzheimer’s assessment, and those doctors would always come back and tell me, ‘No, this is not due to Alzheimer’s disease.’”

Cross teamed up with Brier and other researchers to study whether people with MS have the same risk of developing Alzheimer’s as those without the condition.

The researchers used PrecivityAD2, a blood test from [C2N Diagnostics](https://c2n.com/) that’s approved in the U.S. to predict the presence of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain. These toxic protein clumps are a hallmark and a driver of Alzheimer’s-associated neurodegeneration.

PrecivityAD2 looks for signs of Alzheimer’s in the blood by measuring three key indicators: the ratio of two forms of a protein called tau, the ratio of two forms of amyloid-beta protein, and a score called the amyloid probability score (APS2), which predicts the likelihood of having Alzheimer’s.

The team recruited 100 people older than 60 with MS and compared their PrecivityAD2 results with those of 300 sex- and age-matched adults without MS. These controls, who could have either normal or impaired cognitive function, had similar rates of an Alzheimer’s genetic risk factor, called _APOE_, to MS patients.

Results showed that people with MS were about half as likely to have signs of Alzheimer’s as controls. For example, the proportion of people with a positive APS2 score was more than twice as high among those without MS (15.3% vs. 7.1%), meaning they were more likely to have amyloid-beta plaques than MS patients. Similar observations were made for the tau ratio (18.3% vs. 9%).

When the researchers performed brain scans on 11 MS patients, they found that the blood test results generally matched the brain imaging findings, especially for the APS2 and tau ratio. This means the PrecivityAD2 test is reliable for predicting amyloid-beta plaques in the brain.

The findings suggest that MS may protect against Alzheimer’s.

Moreover, MS patients positive for either APS2 or tau ratio were significantly more likely, by up to 23 times, to have two or more atypical MS features at diagnosis, suggesting that a more typical MS profile was even more protective against Alzheimer’s.

The researchers also studied the effects of a gene called _APOE_, which is linked to Alzheimer’s.

They found that patients carrying one or two copies of _APOE3_, the most common genetic _APOE_ variant that is linked to an average risk of Alzheimer’s, had lower APS2 and tau ratio than those without MS. This protective effect wasn’t seen in MS patients with two copies of _APOE4_, a variant linked to a more than twofold higher risk of Alzheimer’s.

The results suggest “that MS is associated with a low prevalence of \[amyloid-related damage\] based on \[blood\] biomarkers,” the researchers wrote.

“If we could identify what aspect is protective and apply it in a controlled way, that could inform therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer’s disease,” Brier said.

You will create a ready-to-use social media post aimed at healthcare professionals. The goal is to summarize key takeaways from a webpage scraping in a concise, bullet-point format, focusing on actionable insights and recent changes that could impact clinical practice. The post should be crafted to subtly encourage discussion, without directly addressing the audience as healthcare professionals.

Additionally, include a link to the source and relevant hashtags to increase visibility.","Thumbnail image URL: https://medsii.azureedge.net/images/638604237763059957-66cec4cf4e2a8b3bb83557f1.jpg

More information and resources about Pemgarda and its authorization are available on [FDA's website](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4241459-1&h=4186747522&u=https%3A%2F%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDUsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZkYS5nb3YvZHJ1Z3MvZW1lcmdlbmN5LXByZXBhcmVkbmVzcy1kcnVncy9lbWVyZ2VuY3ktdXNlLWF1dGhvcml6YXRpb25zLWRydWdzLWFuZC1ub24tdmFjY2luZS1iaW9sb2dpY2FsLXByb2R1Y3RzP3V0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1nb3ZkZWxpdmVyeSIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyNDA4MjYuOTk1NDc0NTEifQ.FfM7RS1KDjttNBIGBT70jWVn20tpf4HofMKe-8Okhfg%2Fs%2F1256185920%2Fbr%2F248001445955-l&a=FDA%27s+website).  
      
    
*   On Monday, the FDA announced registration has opened for the September 6 public meeting, ""[Advancing Treatments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4241459-1&h=2438539027&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fdrugs%2Fnews-events-human-drugs%2Fadvancing-treatments-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd-09062024&a=Advancing+Treatments+for+Post-Traumatic+Stress+Disorder+\(PTSD\))."" This public meeting, with both virtual and in-person attendance options, will feature a panel discussion with federal partners to explore efforts to accelerate treatment development for PTSD, including psychedelic drug development. This meeting will also provide an opportunity for people with lived PTSD experience, including veterans, family members, and patient advocates; researchers and scientists; and drug developers to provide public comment.  
      
    
*   On Monday, the FDA posted a new video in the [""FDA In Your Day""](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4241459-1&h=2754613290&u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FNjdG6teOEqw&a=%22FDA+In+Your+Day%22) series. In this video, Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Hilary Marston discusses Lyme disease.  
      
    
*   On Friday, the FDA announced a [webinar for the _Final Guidance: Remanufacturing of Medical Devices_](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4241459-1&h=1307994920&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fnews-events%2Ffda-meetings-conferences-and-workshops%2Fwebinar-final-guidance-remanufacturing-medical-devices-09102024&a=webinar+for+the+Final+Guidance%3A+Remanufacturing+of+Medical+Devices) that will be held on September 10, 2024, 1-2 p.m. ET. The FDA issued the final guidance as a part of its ongoing efforts to help explain the difference between remanufacturing and servicing. This guidance clarifies whether activities performed on devices are likely remanufacturing, which is different than servicing activities such as maintenance and repair. This clarification is intended to help ensure consistency and a better understanding of the regulatory requirements applicable to remanufacturers. Registration for the webinar is not required.

**LA JOLLA, CA—**Fighting cancer effectively often involves stopping cancer cells from multiplying, which requires understanding proteins that the cells rely on to survive. Protein profiling plays a critical role in this process by helping researchers identify proteins—and their specific parts—that future drugs should target. But when used on their own, past approaches haven’t been detailed enough to spotlight all potential protein targets, leading to some being missed.

Now, by combining two methods of protein analysis, a team of chemists at Scripps Research has mapped more than 300 small molecule-reactive cancer proteins, as well as their small molecule binding sites. Revealing key protein targets that, when disrupted with certain chemical compounds (or small molecules), halt cancer cell growth may eventually enable the development of more effective and precise cancer treatments. The findings were published in [_Nature Chemistry_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-024-01601-1) on August 13, 2024.

“One method gave us a broad view of which proteins were interacting with the chemicals, and the second method showed exactly where those interactions were happening,” says co-senior author [Benjamin Cravatt, PhD](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/cravatt/), the Norton B. Gilula Chair in Biology and Chemistry at Scripps Research.

Both methods are forms of activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), a technique that Cravatt pioneered to capture protein activity on a global scale. The research team used their dual approach to flag both the proteins and protein sites that interacted with a library of stereoprobes—chemical compounds designed to permanently bind to proteins in a selective manner. Stereoprobes are used to study protein functions and identify possible drug targets.

“We made a conscious effort to design our stereoprobes with chemical features that tend to be underrepresented in compounds typically used in drug discovery settings,” says co-senior author [Bruno Melillo, PhD](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/melillo/), an institute investigator in the Department of Chemistry at Scripps Research. “This strategy increases our chances of making discoveries that can advance biology, and eventually translate into improvements to human health.”

The research team’s stereoprobes were electrophilic, meaning they were designed to irreversibly bind to proteins—specifically to cysteine. This amino acid is pervasive in proteins, including those found in cancer cells, and it helps form important structural bonds. When chemicals react with cysteine, they can disrupt these bonds and cause proteins to malfunction, which interferes with cell growth, and many cancer drugs irreversibly bind to cysteines on proteins.

“We also focused on cysteine because it’s the most nucleophilic amino acid,” says first author [Evert Njomen, PhD](https://magazine.scripps.edu/awards-and-honors/2021/summer/evert-njomen-howard-hughes-medical-institute-fellowship/), an HHMI Hanna H. Gray Fellow at Scripps Research and a postdoctoral research associate in Cravatt’s lab.

To find out which specific proteins would bond with the stereoprobes, the team turned to a method known as protein-directed ABPP. Using this approach, the researchers uncovered more than 300 individual proteins that reacted with the stereoprobe compounds. But still, they wanted to dig deeper and identify the reactions’ precise locations.

The second method, called cysteine-directed ABPP, pinpointed exactly where the stereoprobes were binding on the proteins. This allowed the team to “zoom in” on a specific protein pocket and examine whether the cysteine within reacted with the stereoprobes, similar to focusing on a single spot on a puzzle board to see if a particular piece fits.

Each stereoprobe molecule had two main components: the binding part and the electrophilic part. Once the binding component recognizes the cancer cell protein pocket, hopefully, the stereoprobe molecule can enter—like how a key needs to fit in a lock. When a stereoprobe remained in a pocket that’s critical to the cancer cell’s function, it blocked the protein from binding to other proteins—ultimately preventing cell division.

“By targeting these very specific stages in the cell cycle, there’s potential to slow down the growth of cancer cells,” says Njomen. “A cancer cell would stay in what is _almost_ a state of two cells, and your body’s immune system would detect it as defective and direct it to die.”

Identifying precise protein regions that are critical to cancer cell survival could help researchers develop more targeted treatments to stop cells from multiplying.

Among the team’s other key findings was confirming that their double-pronged approach painted a more accurate picture of protein-stereoprobe reactivity than a single method.

“We've always known that both methods had their drawbacks, but we didn’t know exactly how much information was lost by using just one technique,” says Njomen. “It was surprising to see that a substantial number of protein targets were missed when we used one platform over the other.”

The team hopes that their findings will one day inform new cancer therapies targeting cell division. In the meantime, Njomen wants to design new stereoprobe libraries to uncover protein pockets implicated in illnesses beyond cancer, including inflammatory disorders.

“Many proteins have been implicated in diseases, but we don't have stereoprobes to research them,” she said. “Moving forward, I’d like to find more protein pockets that we can study for drug discovery purposes.”

_In addition to Cravatt, Njomen and co-senior author Bruno Melillo, authors of the study, “_[_Multi-Tiered Chemical Proteomic Maps of Tryptoline Acrylamide-Protein Interactions in Cancer Cells_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-024-01601-1)_” are Rachel E.

SILVER SPRING, Md., Aug. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded the indications of the Insulet SmartAdjust technology, an interoperable automated glycemic controller previously indicated for the management of type 1 diabetes in individuals two years and older, to also include management of type 2 diabetes in individuals 18 years and older. An interoperable automated glycemic controller is software that automatically adjusts insulin delivery to a person with diabetes by connecting to an alternate controller-enabled insulin pump (ACE pump) and integrated continuous glucose monitor (iCGM).

**""The FDA has long worked with the diabetes community to ensure access to additional options and flexibilities for diabetes management,"" said Michelle Tarver, M.D., Ph.D., acting director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. ""Automated insulin dosing technology has previously been available only for people with type 1 diabetes. Today's action helps expand access to this important diabetes management tool to millions of adults living in the U.S. with type 2 diabetes.  The FDA is committed to advancing new device innovation that can improve the health and quality of life for people living with chronic diseases that require day-to-day maintenance like diabetes.""**

More than 11% of Americans are diagnosed with diabetes, a condition in which the body does not make enough or properly use the blood glucose-regulating hormone insulin. In people with type 2 diabetes, patients may take medications that can help increase insulin secretion or improve insulin sensitivity, in addition to following a healthy eating plan and physical activity. Many patients also need to use insulin therapy to keep their blood sugar in a safe range.

Previously, insulin therapy options for people with type 2 diabetes were limited to methods such as injection with a syringe, an insulin pen or an insulin pump, all of which require patients to self-administer insulin one or more times a day and check blood glucose frequently to achieve the best results. Today's clearance provides a new option that can automate many of these manual tasks, potentially reducing the burden of living with this chronic disease.

The FDA reviewed data from a clinical study in which 289 individuals 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes on insulin used the Insulet SmartAdjust technology for 13 weeks. This study enrolled a diverse group of subjects from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, with a wide range of ages, education and income levels. Study participants had varying amounts of experience with diabetes and insulin use, and many subjects were also using common non-insulin diabetes medications like GLP1 agonists. Overall, the study showed that subjects' blood sugar control improved compared to before the study and these improvements were seen across all demographic groups. There were no complications or serious adverse events related to the use of the SmartAdjust technology. Adverse events reported during the study were generally mild to moderate, and included hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and skin irritation.

The FDA reviewed the SmartAdjust technology software through the [510(k) premarket clearance pathway](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4240582-1&h=4035831424&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedical-devices%2Fdevice-approvals-denials-and-clearances%2F510k-clearances&a=510\(k\)+premarket+clearance+pathway). A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that a new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device.

*   **The FDA has granted an orphan drug designation to opaganib (Yeliva, ABC294640) for the treatment of patients with neuroblastoma.**
*   **Neuroblastoma develops from immature nerve cells and makes up 15% of all pediatric cancer-related deaths.**
*   **Opaganib has now received 2 orphan drug designations by the FDA, with the first being for cholangiocarcinoma treatment.**

Opaganib has gained FDA orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with neuroblastoma, a pediatric malignancy arising from neuroblasts, immature neural crest cells.1

If opaganib is approved in neuroblastoma, this orphan drug designation offers a 7-year marketing exclusivity period. This also leads to additional benefits, including accelerated development and review times, potential grant funding, and possible tax credits.

""RedHill is proud to have received a second orphan drug designation for opaganib in oncology, following its previous designation for cholangiocarcinoma. This designation for neuroblastoma–the most common infancy malignancy and for which new options are urgently needed–adds to opaganib's potential as a novel oncological agent,"" said Mark Levitt, MD, PhD, chief scientific officer at RedHill, in a press release.

Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, accounting for approximately 15% of pediatric cancer-related deaths. While it typically affects children aged 5 or younger, it can also occur in older children. Approximately 650 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed in the US each year, and general treatment strategies include a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and sometimes targeted therapy or immunotherapy.

Opaganib is a proprietary, investigational, host-directed, and potentially broad-acting drug. The first-in-class agent is administered orally and is a sphingosine kinase-2 selective inhibitor with anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activity. Preclinically, opaganib has shown positive results for the treatment of renal fibrosis. It also shows the ability to potentially target multiple oncology, radioprotection, viral, inflammatory, and gastrointestinal indications.

The agent is currently in development for the treatment of multiple diseases, including obesity-related syndromes, prostate cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome, Sulfur Mustard exposure, COVID-19, Ebola, and more.2

Opaganib has undergone studies in advanced cholangiocarcinoma and prostate cancer. The phase 2a clinical study (NCT03377179) of opaganib in patients with advanced, unresectable cholangiocarcinoma led to it being granted its first orphan drug designation from the FDA.

An investigator-sponsored phase 2 study (NCT04207255) evaluating opaganib in patients with prostate cancer has also completed enrollment. Patient follow-up for this study is ongoing at the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center and Emory University.

A phase 1 chemoradiotherapy study protocol is also ready for FDA investigational new drug submission.1

""Opaganib has broad oncology potential with promising preliminary clinical data in solid tumor cancers such as prostate cancer and \[cholangiocarcinoma\], and data from a range of US government supported and Apogee-conducted preclinical studies in various indications, including radioprotection, and also in combination with RedHill's RHB-107. We also see such utility extending to the potential for opaganib to have a sensitizing effect in hormone receptor pathway inhibition therapy, which the Company expects to test in a planned externally funded phase 2 study,"" added Levitt in the press release.

2024-08-26 06:50:00,2024-08-30 00:16:24,"🔍 Exciting advancements in middle ear diagnostics! Key insights from the recent study on optical coherence tomography (OCT) in ear imaging:

- **OCT Enhancements**: A hand-held OCT otoscope is able to capture high-resolution 3D images of the tympanic membrane (TM) and middle ear, surpassing traditional otoscopic methods.

- **Clinical Applications**: This new device has shown increased accuracy in diagnosing chronic and acute otitis media, differentiating cholesteatomas from inflammatory tissues, and assessing TM health, thus improving patient outcomes.

- **Cost-Effective**: Compared to MRI and CT, the OCT otoscope is less expensive, portable, and doesn’t involve ionizing radiation, making it suitable for routine clinical use.

- **Large Field of View**: Designed to image nearly the entire TM, it allows for better visualization of subtle pathologies that might otherwise go unnoticed.

The introduction of this technology is a significant leap towards more precise and timely diagnoses in otology. What future implications do you see for such imaging techniques in routine clinical practice?

Introduction
------------

The way in which physicians view the tympanic membrane (TM) and middle ear in the clinic has not changed much over the last 150 years. A speculum is placed into the ear canal with lens-aided viewing and illumination through the aperture of the speculum. The most common speculum used today was invented by A. Hartmann in Berlin in 1881.[1](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r1) Since then, illumination and optics have improved but little else has changed other than the addition of a digital camera for video otoscopy. Routine otoscopic imaging yields information on the surface of the TM, but with no depth perception because only a monocular view can be obtained. If the membrane is transparent, the ossicles just below may be discerned and used as a reference for TM depth. However, no quantitative three-dimensional image is possible, and in many pathological cases the TM is opaque, preventing visualization of the ossicular chain. Subjective interpretation varies with physician experience[2](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r2),[3](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r3) and can lead to incorrect or delayed diagnosis. For example, the United States pediatrician rate of successful otitis media diagnosis is 51% with a false positive rate of 26% as the diagnosis is mostly based on clinical presentation.[4](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r4) Modern medical imaging approaches such as MRI and CT are only sparingly utilized because they are expensive, require a second visit by the patient, and only yield relatively poorly resolved images of the tympanic membrane and middle ear.

Pathologies of the middle ear are composed of a heterogeneous group of diseases that pose a significant risk of hearing loss, facial nerve paralysis, and other serious complications due to their impact on important middle ear and surrounding structures.[5](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r5) Some of the more common diseases include otitis media and cholesteatomas, with an estimated 80% of children by age 3 having one or more episodes of otitis media and an annual incidence of acquired cholesteatomas being 9 to 12.6 per 100,000 people.[6](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r6),[7](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r7) Less common pathologies include more insidious neoplastic middle ear lesions (e.g., facial neuromas, glomus tumors).[8](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r8),[9](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r9) Together, they are major contributors to the over 430 million people globally to have acquired disabling hearing impairment (\>35 to 40 dBA for adult and \>30  dBA for children unaided hearing threshold level).[10](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r10),[11](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r11) The accurate diagnosis of these diseases requires clinicians to pay close attention to subtle changes in normal physiology that are sometimes missed or cannot be detected with existing diagnostic imaging without direct surgical confirmation.[12](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r12),[13](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r13)

Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an interferometry-based non-invasive imaging modality that provides 3D morphological images by capturing the back-scattered light as a laser scan across the biological tissues of interest, is currently being explored as a potential tool to fill the gap in anticipatory diagnostic imaging of the ear by providing structural and functional information not available from traditional diagnostic methods.[14](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r14) It has already been used to help better characterize and diagnose various pathologies of the middle ear and TM.[15](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r15) It has been used to diagnose chronic and acute otitis media with effusion with greater accuracy than traditional otoscopes,[16](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r16) intraoperatively characterize sclerotic changes in patients with otosclerosis,[17](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r17) and differentiate between cholesteatoma and inflammatory tissue.[18](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r18) OCT has also been used to characterize the severity of pathological changes in the TM from diseases that affect the TM such as myringitis.[19](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r19) In addition, compared with traditional imaging modalities, such as MRI and CT, OCT is less expensive, more portable, does not involve ionizing radiation, and has better resolution, traits that make it advantageous as a diagnostic imaging tool for middle ear pathologies in a busy clinical setting.[20](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r20),[21](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r21)

We have designed a hand-held OCT otoscope with a wide field of view that is capable of imaging nearly the entire tympanic membrane and middle ear down to the cochlear promontory.[22](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r22) The integrated fiber-optic interferometer has a similar performance to our prior free-space approach with demonstrated sub-nanometer sensitivity to vibration.[23](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r23) This system, with high performance and a small form factor, is well suited for use in the clinic. In this study, we demonstrate the clinical utility of our device to characterize a variety of middle ear pathologies in a large population of clinic patients. In addition, we present cases in which our device was able to provide information not able to be obtained using traditional imaging techniques. The findings of this study further support the merit of OCT as a clinical diagnostic tool that provides clinicians with information to aid in the early detection and management of various middle ear pathologies.

### OCT Otoscope System

Conceptually, the hand-held OCT (HHOCT) clinical system design (see [Fig. 1](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f1)) follows our previous study that reported the otoscopic OCT system.[22](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r22) It is comprised of several components: the hand-held imaging probe, an endoscopy cart, and a wireless foot pedal serving as an input assist device. The system employed a swept laser with a center wavelength of 1310 nm and a 39 nm bandwidth, yielding an axial resolution of 33.4  μm (in tissue, n\=1.3) for OCT imaging, which is sufficient for resolving the human middle ear structures.[24](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r24)

The essential optical system design is shown in [Fig. 1(a)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f1). The swept laser output was directed into a 90:10 optical fiber coupler (fC). The 10% side illuminated the reference arm of the interferometer. After passing through a fiber optic patch cable sized to an optical path length matched with the sample arm, the reference light passed into a 50:50 fC where it was combined with the sample arm. The 90% side illuminated the sample arm, passing through a circulator (Circ) and then onto the hand-held imaging probe. Inside the hand-held imaging probe, the light was guided by a dual axes MEMS mirror (Mirrocle Technology, Northamptonshire, United Kingdom) through the objective lens and onto the sample for scanning. The back-reflected light passed back through the circulator and was combined with the reference arm via the 50:50 optical fC. The two outputs of the fC were directed into the balanced photodetector (BPD, WL-BPD600MA, Wieserlabs, Penzberg, Germany).

The objective yielded a 38  μm (FWHM) scanning beam spot at the focal plane measured by a commercial scanning-slit optical beam profiler (BP104-IR, Thorlabs, Newton, New Jersey, United States) and 5.03 mm depth of focus (DOF) calculated from the waist (1/e2) of a Gaussian beam, as shown in [Fig. 1(e)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f1). A ray tracing diagram for the objective lens is shown in [Fig. 1(d)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f1). As can be seen, the rays cross at ∼16  mm from the final lens surface at a point coinciding approximately with the tip of the speculum. From that point, the rays fan out and come to a focus at an arc about 27 mm from the crossing. As a result, the image is sampled in a spherical polar coordinate system, unlike our prior telecentric system, which naturally samples in the more convenient Cartesian space. Below, we describe our approach to resampling in Cartesian space and aberration correction. The advantage of this imaging pattern is a larger field of view, 7.4 mm at the focal plane through the limited aperture of the middle ear speculum. This represents an approximately two-fold increase over our prior telecentric system.

A high-pass dichroic mirror (DM) positioned between the MEMS mirror and an achromatic objective lens (aL) directed the back-reflected visible light onto a small CMOS sensor (MU9PC-MH, XIMEA, Münster, Germany) within the hand-held imaging probe to generate a video otoscope image. Visible light illumination of the ear canal was accomplished by a set of visible LEDs mounted around the objective lens. Real-time video output from the CMOS was shown on the monitor and used by the clinician to guide the hand-held unit to the proper position for OCT imaging. As a size comparison of our HHOCT imaging probe with a typical otoscope, we photographed the two side-by-side as shown in [Fig. 1(f)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f1). The outer shell of the HHOCT device is designed to resemble the grip angle and size of a standard otoscope. This design choice aims to make it familiar for the clinician and ensure patient comfort during examinations.

The endoscopy cart housed the major electronic components. Detailed information about the electronic devices and signal processing procedures can be found in previous studies.[22](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r22),[23](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r23) Briefly, the interferometric signal from the BPD was connected to a digitizer and processed using custom software written in Python, C++, and Cuda C. The 400 MHz clock from the swept laser served as the master clock. The data acquisition (DAQ) board generated an enable trigger that worked as a logical AND so that the digitizer only acquired data during the desired portion of the mirror scan. The DAQ also generated a synchronized analog signal for controlling the MEMS mirror. In addition, the foot pedal facilitated hands-free data acquisition, minimizing motion artifacts caused by the operator. The foot pedal, operated through the Bluetooth Secure Personal Network (PAN), was paired with the system software for image capture that allowed a single operator hands-free operation for the standalone and meticulous measurements in clinical procedures.

As noted above, the new imaging device has a much larger field of view than our prior telecentric systems. As a consequence, we sample in spherical polar space rather than the typical Cartesian space as well as introduce some image aberration. To correct this and enable accurate image dimensions, we developed a two-part algorithm that includes coordinate transformation and aberration correction.

### Model for Coordinate Transformation

Although our OCT system nominally scans in spherical polar coordinates, we chose to treat it as two polar coordinate systems, in part because each axis of the MEMs mirror has its own hysteresis and center of rotation. Hence, OCT volume scanning involves two steps: x\-z plane scanning (fast axis) and y\-z plane scanning (slow axis). As shown in [Fig. 2](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f2), we establish two Cartesian coordinate systems to represent the real sample space; one follows the slow axis RC1(O,X,Y,Z), and the other is based on the fast axis RC2(O′,X′,Y′,Z′), with O(O′) representing the mirror rotation center. A polar coordinate system Rraw(Oraw,xraw,yraw,zraw) is introduced to represent the measured image space.

Fig. 2[Download](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceedings/DownloadFigures?url=/ContentImages/Journals/JBOPFO/29/8/086005/FigureImages/JBO_29_8_086005_f002.png)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Model of the coordinate transformation for the otoscopic OCT system. The green 3D shape represents the collected data. The fast-axis and slow-axis coordinate systems are shown in blue and red, respectively. The gray plane represents an arbitrary plane represented in both spaces.

![Image 2: JBO_29_8_086005_f002.png](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/ContentImages/Journals/JBOPFO/29/8/086005/WebImages/JBO_29_8_086005_f002.png)

Assuming a point P in the plane is denoted as P1(x1,y1,z1) in RC1 and P2(x2,y2,z2) in RC2, we establish the relationship between them as

where M represents the transformation matrix,

Eq. (2)
-------

M\=\[10000cos(φ1)sin(φ1)(D1−D2)sin(φ1)0−sin(φ1)cos(φ1)(D1−D2)cos(φ1)0001\],

where φ1 is the angle between two axes as defined in [Fig. 2](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f2).

According to Eqs. (1) and (2), we derive

Eq. (3)
-------

{x1\=x2y1\=cos(φ1)y2+sin(φ1)z2+(D1−D2)sin(φ1)z1\=−sin(φ1)y2+cos(φ1)z2+(D1−D2)cos(φ1).

Furthermore, we represent the equation of the plane in RC1 as

Eq. (4)
-------

z1\=x1 tan(θ1)+y1 tan(θ2)+(d+D1).

The point P is represented in RC2 as

Therefore, we derive the following equation:

Eq. (9)
-------

r2(cos(φ1)cos(φ2)−sin(φ2)tan(θ1)−sin(φ1)cos(φ2)tan(θ2))\=d+D1+(D1−D2)(sin(φ1)tan(θ2)−cos(φ1)).

In the polar space, we know point P is represented as

Hence, φ1 and φ2 are given as

Finally, we define the expression of each axial profile position zraw in Rraw as

Eq. (15)
--------

zraw\=d+D1+(D1−D2)\[sin(yraw−y0D1)tan(θ2)−cos(yraw−y0D1)\]cos(yraw−y0D1)cos(xraw−x0D2)−sin(xraw−x0D2)tan(θ1)−sin(yraw−y0D1)cos(xraw−x0D2)tan(θ2)−D2.

We initially constructed the model with six parameters ((x0,y0,D1,D2,θ1,θ2)) based on Eq. (15). The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was used as the performance indicator for the optimization; it is given as

Eq. (16)
--------

RMSE\=1mn∑1m∑1n(zraw(i,j)−z^(i,j))2,

where m and n represent the axial and lateral pixel numbers in the OCT images, respectively, and z^ denotes the values obtained from the model.

### Model for Aberration Correction

After performing a coordinate transformation, the OCT image exhibited distortion attributed to optical aberrations, as illustrated in [Fig. 3(a)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f3). We imaged a checkerboard calibration target (Edmund Optics Inc., Barrington, New Jersey, United States), 0.2×0.2  mm square pattern, at various imaging depths while controlling the spatial offset to assess the image quality and the extent of the aberrations. We estimated the residual aberration present in depth slices of an OCT volume by constructing a polynomial model based on the coordinate correspondence between the OCT enface images with the standard checkerboard pattern image serving as the reference.

### Clinical Imaging Protocol

This study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Southern California (HS-21-00338). Over 100 patients were imaged after providing informed consent in a tertiary care otology clinic at Keck Hospital of USC from October 2022 to June 2023. Patients’ ears were cleaned of wax with a curette prior to imaging. Inclusion criteria included anyone with a patent ear canal with visibility of the TM on the otoscopic view. Exclusion criteria included patients with active bleeding, discharge, or open wound in the external ear canal; a non-visible TM; or a non-patent ear canal. Patients were imaged while sitting upright in an exam chair. Both ears were imaged unless a patient had abnormal anatomy or intolerance to the plastic ear speculum that made imaging one ear not possible within a clinic setting.

Multiple OCT volumes were obtained from each of the four anatomical quadrants of the TM using superficially identified anatomical landmarks (e.g., Umbo, pars flaccida) on live otoscopic video feed to orient the scanning volume location and corroborate ME structures seen in real time OCT B scans. A single volume scan took 0.4 s. The relatively high speed helped to reduce motion artifacts that may arise from patient or operator movement. The region of interest was selected with the center of the OCT beam positioned directly over the umbo. This was done to encompass the entire tympanic membrane (TM) and cover the area with suspected pathology, thereby maximizing the likelihood of capturing intriguing pathological features within the OCT volumes. The total imaging time, including consenting the patient, reviewing the images, and explaining to patients what they were seeing, was <5  min. OCT volumes were post-processed and analyzed using MatLab (MathWorks), Amira (Thermofisher Scientific), and Fiji (NIH).

### Coordinate Transformation and Aberration Correction

We found the following parameters in [Table 1](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#t001) for mapping our volumetric images into Cartesian space. Examples of images at the focal plane and ±2  mm before and after coordinate transformation are shown in [Fig. 3(a)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f3) columns 1 and 2. The imaging target has 200  μm squares with an asymmetric cross near the center of the image to aid in registration. As can be seen, although the image quality is improved, there is still aberration, resembling barrel distortion, that can be corrected.

We performed aberration correction using the same checkerboard calibration target at six different depths ranging from −5 to 5 mm. Between these depths, we assumed a linear relationship. As demonstrated in [Figs. 3(b)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f3) and [3(c)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f3), the linear fit among corresponding points has an R2 of 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. Therefore, we can readily realize the aberration correction of 3D OCT images by linear fitting. The result following this algorithm is the third column in [Fig. 3(a)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f3), i.e., after coordinate transformation and aberration correction.

### Normal TM and Middle Ear

Here, we present several example cases from the clinical study. Our first example is a patient with a healthy middle ear as confirmed by an expert otologist through clinical assessment and otoscopic examination. From the otoscopic view in [Fig. 4(a)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f4), the tympanic membrane can be seen to be fairly transparent, which allows us to see the incus, malleus, and cochlear promontory through the membrane. Other anatomical landmarks include the umbo and cone-of-light. [Figure 4(b)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f4) is a summed voxel projection (SVP) of the OCT volume in which the 2D image is generated by summing along the depth dimension. This generates an image that can be directly compared with the standard otoscope view to verify orientation. [Figures 4(c)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f4) and [4(d)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f4) are representative cross-sectional B-scans that were extracted along the dashed colored lines, as shown in panels (a) and (b). The cross-sections show a normal thin tympanic membrane along with sections of the chorda tympani and stapes in addition to the anatomy that was also visible in the otoscopic view. [Figure 4(e)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f4) displays the 3D volume rendering that visualizes major anatomical structures presented in the otoscopic view.

### Abnormal Tissue Growth

This case is a patient presented with 2 weeks of ear pain and aural fullness. An otoscopic evaluation by an expert otologist revealed what appeared to be abnormal tissue growth superficially on bilateral TMs. The level of involvement with the TM and if the tissue was directly against the TM were not discernible with a routine physical exam. The physician used OCT imaging to determine if tissue debridement was possible in the clinic without damage to the TM. Representative images are shown in [Fig. 5](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f5).

![Image 5: JBO_29_8_086005_f005.png](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/ContentImages/Journals/JBOPFO/29/8/086005/WebImages/JBO_29_8_086005_f005.png)

Panels (a) and (b) are the otoscopic image and SVP. Panels (c) and (d) are representative cross-sectional OCT B-scans that show the layered plaques of abnormal tissue partially adherent to the surface of the TM with partial elevation of the TM. The plaques are strongly scattering and therefore strongly shadow the tissue below. This leads to the sharp edges labeled (1) and (2) in panel (d) that look like discontinuities in the TM. Panel (e) displays a still image from a movie showing the 3D volume rendering. The volume rendering helps visualize the plaques.

These are denoted with white arrows and circled numbers. Given the findings, a conservative management approach with Debrox drops (Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc., Irvington, New York, United States) was chosen. The patient was imaged every week over four subsequent visits. Images from the final visit are shown in [Figs. 5(f)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f5)–[5(j)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f5). The images clearly show the resolution and clearance of abnormal tissue. The images revealed no residual tissue plaques, a thin normal-looking TM in cross-section, and middle ear anatomy such as the incus and cochlear promontory. Panel (j) displays a still image from a movie showing the 3D volume rendering. The volume rendering helps show how the plaques have largely been resolved.

### Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion

Images from a patient with left ear chronic otitis media with effusion are shown in [Fig. 6](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f6). An otoscopic evaluation revealed opacification of the TM potentially consistent with fluid in the middle ear with no apparent air-fluid levels, bubbles, or active otorrhea. OCT imaging demonstrated speckled signal intensity underlying a thickened TM distinct from the dark middle ear space evident in the OCT images of the right ear. The signal intensity drops off uniformly deeper into the middle ear space along the length of the TM, consistent with OCT imaging through a mucoid effusion with extensive scattering. A representative area with mucoid effusion adjacent to the TM is labeled by white arrows in [Fig. 6](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f6). Following imaging, subsequent in-office myringotomy expressed thick yellow opaque mucoid fluid from the patients left ear, confirming the presence of fluid.

### TM Perforation

A patient with a history of chronic otitis media presented with a small elliptical TM perforation. On otoscopic examination during a 6-week follow-up exam, [Fig. 7(a)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f7), the perforation appeared to be non-healing and patent into the middle ear cavity. However, the OCT cross-sectional images in [Figs. 7(c)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f7) and [7(d)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f7) clearly show a thin layer of TM ∼68\-μm thick, filling the space where the perforation had been. The OCT volume showed a healing elliptical perforation with minor and major axes of 300 and 400  μm, respectively, and a thin layer of tissue across the entire area.

### TM Retraction

A patient with apparent TM retraction identified on otoscopic evaluation by an expert otologist was imaged. In the OCT cross-sections, [Figs. 8(c)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f8) and [8(d)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f8), the TM is shown to be severely retracted. A co-registered normal TM is shown for reference in grayscale and denoted with a white arrow labeled 3. Inspection of the OCT volume showed that the TM was touching the incus and was very close but not touching the promontory. These are labeled in representative cross-sections by the circled numbers 1 and 2, respectively. TM contact with the incus brings an increased risk of bone necrosis and cholesteatoma formation.

### Tympanic Membrane Protrusion with Air Pocket

A patient with a history of bilateral otosclerosis, stapedectomies (ear surgery to remove the stapes bone), and unknown pathology affecting the right ear TM presenting with decreased hearing and ear fullness was examined. They had seen several prior otologists with no reported clear diagnosis other than bulging of the TM or post-surgical changes. The otoscopic view appeared to show a partially white opaque TM possibly consistent with post-surgical scarring or middle ear mass of the TM posteriorly in [Fig. 9(a)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f9). TM continuity with the superior-anterior quadrant of the ear canal was indeterminate with potential perforation on the otoscopic view. In [Figs. 9(c)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f9) and [9(d)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f9), further OCT imaging demonstrated the presence of a ∼1.3\-mm diameter air pocket within a body of thick scar tissue. The scar tissue, ∼420  μm thick, was continuous with the interior layer of the TM near the center, annotated with white arrows in [Figs. 9(c)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f9) and [9(d)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f9), demonstrating no perforation on OCT imaging.

Discussion
----------

Our new form factor and optical design for the OCT otoscope system provide a more compact hand-held component with a larger field of view than our prior work. The hand-held piece of the device is similar in size and shape to a standard battery-powered otoscope \[see [Fig. 1(f)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f1)\]. The new optical design with a larger field of view, but otherwise similar optical performance as our prior work, comes at the cost of post-processing to recast the image, nominally collected in spherical polar coordinates, into Cartesian coordinates. Currently, we display the raw images in real time and do the resampling in postprocessing. The resampling could be done in real time; however, the quality of the raw images is good enough to easily see the relevant pathologies. The resampling is only important for making quantitative measurements, e.g., size of perforation, distance of TM to the incus or promontory, and TM thickness. Nevertheless, if real-time resampling proved necessary, it can be done using a GPU as demonstrated[25](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r25) recently for a related resampling algorithm. In this system, we used a new custom laser source from Insight Photonics Solutions, Inc. (Lafayette, Colorado, United States) that uses a single laser chip. The single chip limits the available bandwidth but allows us to image at a line rate of 200 kHz and still maintain a large Nyquist depth of 17.7 mm. Although a large Nyquist depth is needed for middle ear imaging, 10 to 12 mm would probably be sufficient. A unique property of the Insight swept laser is the ability to change the sweep frequency. In the future, we can likely increase the line rate up to 300 kHz using this same laser; however, because the sampling rate remains fixed (400 MHz), our Nyquist depth would be reduced to 11.6 mm, which is still well within the range noted above.

The 2× increase in imaging speed over our prior work improves the image quality by reducing motion artifact, but it comes at the cost of axial resolution, which is reduced by approximately a factor of 2. Nevertheless, given the size of most anatomical features in the middle ear (e.g., TM thickness ∼100  μm and incus diameter ∼200  μm), the loss in resolution does not significantly degrade our ability to identify pathology within the TM and middle ear. Likewise, although we did not apply the algorithm here, we could improve our axia l resolution by up to a factor of 2 using a recently developed multi-window approach.[26](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r26)–[28](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r28)

Within the larger clinical study, for this report, we focused on examples in which the OCT imaging provides information that was not available from standard otoscopic examination and could be clinically important. Prior works with OCT devices have been used to characterize and aid in the diagnosis of a number of pathologies of the middle ear.[15](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r15)–[19](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r19) An important example is otitis media with effusion, for which a non-scanning OCT device was developed into an FDA-approved diagnostic tool to help primary care physicians more accurately diagnose cases of otitis media with effusion.[29](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r29) Our device and study build upon this growing body of work by not only being able to identify mucoid otitis media with effusion as shown in [Fig. 6](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f6) within the volumetric image but also characterizing deeper structures and pathologies affecting the middle ear and TM.

Our first example was the growth of abnormal tissue on the TM thought to be due to active myringitis, inflammation of the outer squamous layer of the TM. Normally, this pathology is diagnosed through otoscopic examination that demonstrates signs of inflammation with ulceration, yellow crusting, or polypoid growths.[30](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r30) Treatment often involves curettage of the abnormal tissue and antibiotic drops.[31](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r31),[32](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r32) In the case that we describe in [Fig. 5](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#f5), the abnormal buildup of scar-like tissue and the lack of classical signs of myringitis made diagnosis difficult from just visualization with a standard otoscope. The OCT volumetric images showed that the abnormal tissue was attached to the TM and not just laying on top of the TM. Removing the tissue by debridement could have resulted in tearing of the TM, producing a perforation. Instead, ear drops were administered over a 6-week period.

TM perforations are typically able to be resolved on otoscopic evaluations. They are important because long standing non-healing perforations have been shown to be associated with increased risk of middle ear infections and cholesteatomas with the middle ear space open to the external environment.[33](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r33) What are harder to determine are the intermediate stages of perforation healing and smaller perforations in which otoscopic evaluation are again subject to a health professional’s subjective interpretation. In the case that we describe, the prior perforation appeared to be patent using a standard otoscopic view, but OCT imaging showed a healing layer of TM was present, deferring need for further intervention. This illustrates the potential for OCT imaging to be used for monitoring and managing perforations.

Retraction pockets have not been previously characterized by OCT. In the patient described above, the OCT images clearly showed what areas of the TM were retracted, the relative depth of retraction, and if it was contacting key structures in the middle ear. Current methods of grading the severity of retraction use contact with important structures as a measure and include the use of the Tos and Poulson or Sade scale.[34](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r34) However, grading is based on subjective interpretations by a physician through 2D otoscopic evaluation and hence is not used often due to the difficulty in accurately applying the scales only using traditional 2D information and middle ear pressures.[34](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-29/issue-08/086005/Optical-coherence-tomography-otoscope-for-imaging-of-tympanic-membrane-and/10.1117/1.JBO.29.8.086005.full#r34) With OCT, healthcare professionals would be able to apply these scales using more accurate and objective 3D information.

Finally, we describe a case in which a patient appeared to have a white mass in the middle ear cavity via otoscopic view, but OCT revealed the presence of a scar air pocket that was causing the TM to bulge outward. This demonstrated how the device can be used to characterize patterns of scarring and how it can disrupt the normal architecture of the TM and thus affect the conduction of sound and hearing. Future applications could involve using this ability of OCT to distinguish between the presence of masses versus structural changes such as that described here to determine the need for a further medical workup or investigation.

Conclusion
----------

The operation of the OCT otoscope device described above is sufficiently easy, so a single person can collect a set of images from a patient in seconds to minutes. This has allowed us to regularly image in the USC hearing clinic without disrupting the workflow within the clinic. The improved imaging speed and field of view have aided in the collection of images that provide information not readily available from a traditional otoscope examination. These OCT findings and the pathological information presented in this study serve to further demonstrate hand-held OCT’s ability to be a useful clinical tool.

Markdown Content:
Medtech has had a mixed few years. In 2023, startups in the sector raised $2.2bn with 2024 looking similar — roughly half of the $4bn picked up in 2021, according to [Sifted data.](https://sifted.eu/pro/briefings/medtech-2024)

But there have still been some sizable rounds in recent times. Since the start of 2023, surgical robotics startups have been the biggest winners. The UK’s CMR Surgical picked up [£165m](https://sifted.eu/articles/cmr-surgical-raise-2023) in September last year, Switzerland’s DistalMotion $150m in April 2023 and Italy’s Medical Microinstruments $110m in February this year.

There’s also been some buzz around next-gen diagnostic devices, as founders — including [Spotify’s Daniel Ek](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-eks-body-scanning-neko-health-is-expanding-to-the-uk-news) with his body scanning startup Neko Health — look to tap into the trend of more people using wellbeing and fitness devices like Apple Watches and Oura rings.

But which non-portfolio medtech startups are investors keeping a close eye on? To find out, Sifted spoke to VCs at 415 Capital, Sofinnova Partners, MIG Capital and SHS Capital.

### **Linus Rieder, principal at 415 Capital**

![Image 1](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/23145641/Linus-final-Kopie-scaled-e1724421412663.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)

#### **Medical Microinstruments (MMI) – Italy**

MMI is building surgical robots to help with micro-surgery. Its robotics platform can be used in reconstructive surgery, plastic surgery and head-neck surgery. The startup is looking to solve key issues in microsurgery like the effects of surgeon tremor and reduces the need for microsurgery training.

#### **Gradient Denervation Technologies — France**

Gradient Denervation Technologies is developing a device for treating heart failure patients with associated pulmonary hypertension. As many as [half of heart failure patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199161/) around the world have elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, which is shown to lead to an increased risk of mortality and hospitalisation. There are no approved drug or device therapies for this group of pulmonary hypertension patients. By using minimally invasive ultrasound to treat hyperactive nerves in the pulmonary arteries, however, the startup’s technology has the potential to treat and help tens of thousands of patients each year.

#### **CorWave — France**

CorWave's left ventricular assist device (LVAD) mimics the natural heart's function to treat patients with advanced heart failure. This technology enables the device to replicate the heart pulses, reducing the mechanical damage to blood cells common with current LVADs.

#### **Ganymed Robotics — France** 

Ganymed is working on a robotics platform to assist surgeons with implant placement during knee replacement surgery. The Paris-based company's approach uses computer vision and artificial intelligence to perceive, and extract knowledge from, the surgical environment in a non-invasive manner, removing imaging and registration steps that add time and complexity to knee surgery.

#### **Gleamer — France**

Gleamer is developing AI tools to enhance image interpretation for radiologists. The startup’s main product helps clinicians identify bone trauma at the point of care. Gleamer has achieved multiple regulatory approvals and successfully commercially deployed in both the US and EU.

#### **Salvia BioElectronics — The Netherlands** 

Salvia BioElectronics is developing drug-free neuromodulation therapies — which refers to a group of medical procedures that look to change brain activity by stimulating nerves — for migraines. Salvia's paper-thin implant is designed to be placed under the forehead to reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks by delivering gentle electrical pulses to the nerves associated with the condition. The company is currently in the clinical stage, having received the Breakthrough Device Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which facilitates expedited market access for devices that treat life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating conditions.

### **Fei Tian, principal at MIG Capital**

#### **Artidis — Switzerland**

Artidis is developing imaging tools for cancer diagnostics. It combines a nanotechnology device which analyses tissue with a digital data platform to measure the physical characteristics of both tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment. After determining if a tumour is benign or malignant, Artidis’ technology identifies if it will spread to other sites and can help inform chemotherapy and immunotherapy permeability and treatment response.

#### **CoreMedic — Switzerland** 

CoreMedic has developed an implant which treats the heart condition mitral valve regurgitation (MR). The CoreMedic implant can replace ruptured mitral — a part of the heart — in a minimally invasive procedure that is physiological and reproducible, promising long-term clinical benefits.

### **Cornelius Maas, partner at SHS Capital**

#### **Vitestro — The Netherlands**

Vitestro is developing an autonomous blood drawing device. This innovative device combines robotics and AI to perform blood drawing more efficiently and safely. Over the past year, Vitestro has made significant strides in clinical trials and secured an additional €20m in funding in April. Vitestro’s tool could mean less burden for patients, less work for the medical staff and consequently reduce costs for the healthcare system.

#### **Saphenus — Austria**

Saphenus is developing sensory feedback systems for prosthetics. Their key product, the Suralis system, provides users of lower-limb prosthetics with the sensation of foot contact, significantly improving balance and gait. Recently, Saphenus received FDA approval with their Suralis systema and received reimbursement status with key German medical insurers.

#### **Bluedrop Medical — Ireland**

Bluedrop Medical is developing a medical device to monitor foot health and prevent diabetic foot ulcers. It looks like a weighing scale and aims to enable early detection of foot ulcers, which can lead to amputation. Bluedrop Medical is a good example of how remote monitoring can replace doctor visits while preventing serious disease progression, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

AI surgery tech startup raises $180m from investors including BlackRock
=======================================================================

More than a dozen investors were involved in the equity and debt round for Berlin-based Caresyntax
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Kai Nicol-Schwarz](https://sifted.eu/author/kai-nicol-schwarz/)

3 min read

Berlin-based Caresyntax, which is building an AI-driven data platform for surgery, has raised a $180m Series C extension.

The round is made up of $80m in equity and $100m in debt — and is tied to specific milestones. The fresh funding tops up the startup’s [$130m Series C,](https://sifted.eu/articles/caresyntax-raises-100m) raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.

It’s the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.

Caresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.

### **AI for hospitals**

Caresyntax says it wants to build the “Android” platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals’ surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.

The company’s platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.

While some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax’s platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.

“Effectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,” they add.

If it does what it sets out to do, it’s a big opportunity.

Costs associated with operations account for [30%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6586534/#:~:text=Older%20estimates%20suggest%20that%20inpatient,healthcare%20costs%20%5B2%203%5D.) of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends [11%](https://www.medtecheurope.org/datahub/expenditure/#:~:text=In%20Europe%2C%20an%20average%20of,less%20than%201%25%20of%20GDP.) of GDP on health.

Founded in 2013 in Germany — Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 — its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company’s revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.

### **The rise of smart surgery**

The round comes on the back of a strong 18 months for startups developing tech for the operating theatre.

Since the start of 2023, three of the four biggest medtech raises have all gone to startups building robots to help surgeons. The UK’s CMR Surgical picked up [£165m](https://sifted.eu/articles/cmr-surgical-raise-2023) in September last year, Switzerland’s DistalMotion $150m in April 2023 and Italy’s Medical Microinstruments $110m in February this year.

Investors in Caresyntax’s round include Symbiotic Capital, MTIP AG, BIONIQ Capital, PFM Health Sciences, Pictet Alternative Advisors, surgical.ai, BlackRock Innovation Capital, Aescuvest, Optum Ventures, Cure Capital, Relyens Group, Vesalius Biocapital, Lauxera Capital, Plug & Play Growth Fund and ProAssurance Corp.

Markdown Content:
The meteoric rise of a new class of weight loss drugs over the past two years, known as GLP-1s, has seen a new name take the title of Europe’s most valuable company, helped a country dodge a recession and hit grocery sales in the US.

The valuations of the companies that make this so-called “miracle” class of drugs — which includes Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk (maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and US rival Eli Lilly (maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) — have [soared](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/03/04/the-battle-over-the-trillion-dollar-weight-loss-bonanza) as investors bet big on a medication projected by some to hit [$150bn in sales](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/weight-loss-drug-forecasts-jump-150-billion-supply-grows-2024-05-28/) by the early 2030s.

The potential of the market has not been lost on founders.

It’s a “huge” opportunity, says Kai Eberhardt, the founder and CEO of Oviva, a Swiss weight loss management platform which operates in the UK, France and Germany, alongside its home market. It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.

“For us \[GLP-1 drugs\] are already a strong growth driver,” he says. “The newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.”

While treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva’s overall business — Eberhardt says it’s growing total patient and revenue numbers by “double digit” percentage points year-on-year — the meds could become the startup’s “largest” growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.

### **Riding the wave**

Oviva’s not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity — many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.

In the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart’s CEO, [food sales have fallen](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-04/walmart-says-ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-causing-slight-pullback-by-shoppers?sref=MTy2GeXk) as the [one in eight adults](http://cnbc.com/2024/05/14/healthy-returns-1-in-8-adults-have-taken-glp-1s-like-ozempic-survey.html) in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe’s [most valuable company,](https://www.ft.com/content/19357584-62e0-452f-a06f-7cda1d8cd0e3) propping up [Denmark’s GDP](https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/economics/article/wegovy-proves-to-be-wonder-drug-for-danish-economy-rgd6lqjh5) in the process.

All of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have [convinced them to get out their chequebook](https://sifted.eu/articles/weight-loss-drug-mania-reaches-europe-denmarks-embla-raises-10m): Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a [€10m Series A](https://sifted.eu/articles/weight-loss-drug-mania-reaches-europe-denmarks-embla-raises-10m) in August 2023 a year on from a €3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised €3.1m last summer.

Many startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn’t start life offering them — largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.

UK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a [“men’s health”](https://sifted.eu/articles/numan-mens-health-stigma) brand, but has recently changed that. The company’s website uses images of men _and_ women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.

![Image 1](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/12165326/unnamed-24-e1723478018874.png?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)

Screenshot from Numan's website

Yazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.

Meurling tells Sifted it had hit €14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It’s now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.

Other startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men’s sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.

“\[GLP-1 meds\] are a game changer,” says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be “strange” if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn’t looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.

While GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the “hype” surrounding the drug class has “opened doors” for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler — adding that the startup managed to raise its €400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It’s now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it’ll look to target US employers — who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.

### **Kinks in the supply chain**

There are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector — not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.

Some of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate’s $100m in 2021 and Form Health’s $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than €10m in a single round.

Investors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics — [Manual was still selling past the deadline.](https://sifted.eu/articles/healthtech-manual-selling-ozempic-beyond-uk-government-deadline)

If a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.

“As there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.”

### **Who’ll stump up the cash?**

There’s also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.

While Numan’s head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the “success of private sector companies offering GLP-1 \[drugs\] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS”, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won’t be enough to hit real scale.

“US investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts \[selling to whole organisations like health insurers\],” says Syhler. “This means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care — where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.”

In Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.

In the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.

Oviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS — but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it’s in “mature dialogues with several health systems”.

“It is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,” says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that [don’t always want to work with startups.](https://sifted.eu/articles/ai-healthcare-nhs-startup) Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.

Whether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen — but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. “I've never been an investor in a company that’s got so much attention — in a space that’s got so much attention,” says Arnardottir.

On Wednesday UK-based period tracking app Flo Health announced it had raised $200m — pushing its valuation beyond $1bn and making it Europe’s first femtech unicorn.

It turned out to be a very [buzzy story](https://email.sifted.eu/e3t/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mfCN04/VWd7S56fts6_W5MRMLq4ZH5wFW6YVQGc5jbfNKN5j5FQx3qgyTW7lCdLW6lZ3nfW33mt2d9fhswPW6cbbn42Gk2LbW8scjQ_6cnrxDW1clnhC2ShJQHVccVZ53gzXq5W4wQdZG67pwTSW2-JWpF92k-_3W7wvb489fJTrcW8Yc8WL2J2BxbVsVjMQ2l0S96W8kJSgJ8PlPBnW3C2JWZ7p72hNW6XXzRB8xLSLCW1Qsggq5_4Rb1W2TDtZV1qFp0NW8cjBvC794-SqW6CX8JV3JLP8SW3PhCFV1MtGl5N2XnVkqP0RWYVJ5lGy5VWWL_W95gKqH7mC7fGN8ZGCJCNps2DW3hhNk75-4tsCW6zlG0Z5p-vJhf88-NBl04): as people were quick to point out online, Flo also became Europe’s first women’s health unicorn _with an all-male founding team_ — a detail which sparked a backlash online.

“A company founded by men, led by men and funded by men became the first WOMEN'S health app to achieve unicorn status. If this doesn't show you everything that's wrong with the ecosystem, I don't know what will,” Anna-Sophie Hartvigsen, cofounder of investment learning app and community for women Female Invest, wrote [in a viral LinkedIn post](https://email.sifted.eu/e3t/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mfCN04/VWd7S56fts6_W5MRMLq4ZH5wFW6YVQGc5jbfNKN5j5FPl5bRGYW50kH_H6lZ3l8W4LGN588Q_4ZsW8wQ5KR6wTrX5W7yCq0w85CZG9W3vhYPj1slFYHN7B_Ncv_0lQFW5X-v0Q51XxGqW6MPX5p5pwYL9W1D4cXM5h1_MGW7W96ly7MtK-lW381wDG8L1J_PW2_GGrC99Nz87N7QYN_6c-6xhVbl3C8715Xk_MpwjzGcNvlcW3dD_dz5jH-v9W49__9X8Dl27zN6pG5cpR5Y8-W1P9wsl5X0QKfW7pKmFX4zN8c0Vvdxk071SZSSW3r-vWY72Kwv1W4rpnn35WQhWCW6mSf3c1Z9ZHfVtbKWF8SQ18NW74YWXR83cqHnW4jGq_N5RH-nDW2tGsJ33h0LCbW4zWMDM5z_R9CW2_sJfz188vZJW4qtZ453fg7NWW5LGdY_77tcmZW3F37Zc24XYyMf7-GWgH04), citing stats on the [lack of funding for female founders](https://email.sifted.eu/e3t/Ctc/LZ+113/d2mfCN04/VWd7S56fts6_W5MRMLq4ZH5wFW6YVQGc5jbfNKN5j5FQx3qgyTW7lCdLW6lZ3npVZ6rdY6xdTkKW5dqdCC3CpbHkW6hmw1f8YJJx8W2h-hSY5hYtf0W3HtTS183-N4gN7hMSn23njKxW18dFQG93dPz7N7_1xPQZKQbwW3tfkLc5rhD5vW3kmy8562PSf5VVJMdj80mh0VW2xYdCC11lSqMW4Bjfsz1z2prLW17bbCc8ffd1CW548x4q6l5pqWN1H52hZxSG9WW2_7TbZ8zJD61W1spH161xBM0CW3YV1dC5_NGBBW3_BcXt8sdfLPW8vx_yh1pZ3FtW2rLJgd7p8_CsW7d4VW93Y2nkzW5PBwYY4SptZgf3zzZbM04). “I’m not saying it’s bad that a femtech company is doing well,” she later added in the comments. “I’m saying it’s bad that only men are able to succeed in this space.”

Some founders in the comments underneath Hartvigsen's post said that they’ve struggled with fundraising as a woman; there was also a debate in a private WhatsApp group seen by Sifted about whether female founders should add a token male founder to their team in an effort to increase their chances of getting cheques. Someone in that group added that we won’t fix the trend of men funding men until there are more female investors.

But others didn’t see it that way.

“This achievement should actually be celebrated. As a women's health investor that has invested in 7+ women's health companies, we are yet to see any of them scale,” Deepali Nangia, a partner at Speedinvest, wrote in response to Hartvigsen’s LinkedIn post. “Flo's achievement is a very strong signal to the market that \[direct to consumer\] women's health is monetizable in Europe and that there is money to be made here; this is what investors need to see so more money flows into women's health companies. Not to say that the challenges faced by women in pitching are any less, but we must celebrate all wins that lead to more capital deployed into this sector,” she argued.

Nangia added that she wasn’t doubting there’s a problem, “but every win should not be turned around to a problem… Many people have been working on solving for this problem, which includes many women of course but also men.”

Another commenter added: “If anything, let this be a door for more investors to look closely at the female health industry and invest their money there? Could this be an example of men allies? If it had to be a company founded and led by men, well thank you very much for opening the door, now let the rest go through.”

Priya Oberoi, partner at women’s health-focused VC Goddess Gaia Ventures, added: “Flo reaching series C \[unicorn\] status with 60 mln active users is a win for #womenshealth - helping to close that 131 year gender health gap and getting products and services out there to improve the lives of women.”

""We firmly believe that women's health has been critically overlooked, undervalued and underfunded for far too long,"" Flo said in a statement to Sifted. ""Our sincere hope is that Flo’s funding will inspire more investors to recognise the immense potential in this space."" The company added: ""We're proud to say that more than half (56%) of Flo's employees are women, including our leadership team.""

It’s an important debate, and, readers, I’m curious to hear your thoughts: why aren’t there more female-founded femtech unicorns? Is it a problem that the first European femtech unicorn is founded by men, if the product helps women? Does it open doors for female founders in the space, or actually keep them shut?

URL Source: https://sifted.eu/articles/flo-health-unicorn-raise-news/

Markdown Content:
UK femtech Flo Health is set to raise more than $200m in equity from US growth investor General Atlantic — a backer of companies like Uber and Airbnb.

The period-tracking app’s Series C is the joint-biggest ever raise for a femtech — along with US fertility startup Prelude Fertility — according to data platform Dealroom. It also gives Europe its first femtech unicorn and takes Flo’s total funding to more than $290m.

All the funds have been committed and a stock purchase agreement has been signed, cofounder and CEO Dmitry Gurski tells Sifted. The funding round is expected to close in coming weeks, subject to regulatory approvals.

Flo will use the funds to expand into new user segments like perimenopause and menopause and invest in R&D for AI-driven personalised insights tools.

### **Europe’s first femtech unicorn**

While in the US just a few femtechs have hit unicorn status — including fertility clinics Maven and Kindbody — in Europe the sector’s unicorn stable has been bare until now. Previously, the largest raise by a femtech startup was [Elvie’s](https://sifted.eu/articles/elvie-uk-healthtech-raise) £70m Series C, picked up across two rounds in 2021.

Flo isn’t disclosing what its exact valuation will be when the funds hit its account, but Gurski tells Sifted the company hit a pre-money valuation of $1bn. ""Reaching unicorn status is a significant milestone for Flo and the entire femtech industry,"" he says.

It comes after a challenging time in the market across the last couple years, says Gurski. “But despite everything, Flo has shown steady, significant growth, after more than eight years of continuous expansion.”

Flo’s revenue in 2023 was $112m — up from $35m in 2022, according to the company’s latest annual accounts. Losses over the same period fell from $35m to $25m. The company has just under 500 employees globally, Gurski tells Sifted.

It plans to deploy some of the fresh capital to increase R&D headcount with “investments in top-tier talent across \[our\] global offices in Europe and North America,” Gurski says.

On longer-term plans, he tells Sifted that, “while we're not announcing specific IPO plans at this time, this funding broadens our range of future paths and gives us the flexibility to choose the best path forward for Flo's continued success and impact in the women's health space.” Gurski adds: “Our immediate focus remains on executing our growth strategy and further solidifying our position as a leader in femtech.”

### **The most downloaded women’s health app**

Flo was founded in 2015 — a year before the term “femtech” was first coined by Ida Tin, founder of soon-to-be rival period tracking app Clue. It’s since grown into the most-downloaded women’s health app on both Google Play and AppStore, according to market insights platform Sensor Tower.

Flo’s platform allows users to track their period cycle and monitor symptoms, as well as providing them with tailored health insights and educational content.

The startup says it has 70m monthly active users and close to 5m paid subscribers as of June 2024. About 50% of those are based in the US, with the remaining half split evenly between the UK and EU.

### **Historically underfunded**

Femtech has long been considered an underfunded sector. In 2023 European startups raised just $191m, a fraction of the $9.7bn shelled out on the wider healthtech sector. On top of that funding in the wider digital health sector — which encompasses the vast majority of femtechs — has been [hit hard](https://sifted.eu/articles/digital-health-startups-are-running-out-of-cash) by the downturn.

But despite that, Flo isn’t the only femtech that’s raised a sizeable sum in 2024. In May, Swedish digital birth control startup Natural Cycles picked up $55m, one of the largest European digital health rounds of the year.

Others haven’t been so fortunate. At the start of 2023, Clue announced it was [making layoffs](https://sifted.eu/articles/brainly-clue-aiven-tech-layoffs-arent-over-in-2023) and audio erotica site Emjoy shuttered earlier this year.

URL Source: https://sifted.eu/articles/zoe-raise-15m-us-expansion-news/

Markdown Content:
UK gut health startup Zoe has raised $15m from US-based VC Coefficient Capital as it looks to crack the US market with its microbiome testing and diet advice app. The Series B extension takes the startup’s total funding to $118m.

The news comes as [a number of European startups](https://sifted.eu/articles/aware-amsterdam-lakestar-healthtech-news) vie to crack the direct-to-consumer (D2C) diagnostics market at a time when the post-Covid digital health bubble has looked [close to bursting](https://sifted.eu/articles/digital-health-startups-are-running-out-of-cash).

Zoe has faced its own set of challenges over the past few months. In April, cofounder and CEO Jonathan Wolf announced that the company was [making layoffs](https://sifted.eu/articles/zoe-healthtech-cost-cutting-news) as it looked to cut costs.

But now Zoe’s got its sights set on US expansion, it’s looking to tap into its “biggest opportunity” — according to Wolf.

“Successfully penetrating the US is famously one of the hardest things for a tech company from outside of the country to do,” he tells Sifted. But the reward if Zoe gets it right could be huge, he adds. “That’s partly because the market is so large, but also because the health crisis is so bad.”

### **US expansion**

Wolf says Zoe will use the fresh funding to develop its product, build out a team in the US and, crucially for a D2C startup, invest in marketing and getting Zoe visible to consumers.

But there’s not going to be a “massive splurge”, he tells Sifted. “$15m is not really a big marketing push. It allows us to start to build the business, prove that it’s relevant, that it delivers results.”

While Zoe is the clear frontrunner in the consumer gut microbiome testing field in Europe, it’ll face competition in the US from companies like Viome — which has raised $186m since launching in 2016. Other startups include Seed Health and Flore, which sell supplements for the gut microbiome, and have raised $40m and $11.7m, respectively.

The US is often considered a key market for European healthtechs looking to scale, but it hasn’t always been a happy hunting ground for them. A number of healthtech founders told Sifted that higher salaries and marketing costs and the amount of homegrown competition all made the US [a tricky place to set up shop](https://sifted.eu/articles/european-healthtechs-us-expansion).

But the potential upside is worth the challenge, Wolf says: “For health and nutrition, the US is by far the biggest market.”

Zoe’s goal is to expand globally and “improve the health of millions”, he adds — but to hit those kinds of customer numbers the startup “needs to succeed in the US”.

Wolf’s under no illusions about the cost of that ambition: “There’s a good chance that we will end up needing to raise more money.”

### **A household name**

Zoe was spun out of King's College London in 2017 from research carried out by [now-famous diet influencer Tim Spector](https://sifted.eu/articles/tim-spector-zoe-health).

The startup became a household name during Covid, when it pivoted to allow members of the public to log Covid symptoms. It then launched gut microbiome testing and a diet and lifestyle app in April 2022 in the UK, and has since convinced the likes of Steven Bartlett’s Flight Fund, Balderton, Ahren and Daphni to stump up funds for the company.

Microbiome testing kits cost £299 and a monthly subscription to the app costs between £25 and £35 a month (depending on how long a user subscribes). For that, users get personalised scores on thousands of foods and access to recipes, diet and lifestyle advice. More than 100k people have paid for the service so far, says Wolf.

In the past year Zoe — which was the UK’s [fastest growing healthtech](https://sifted.eu/articles/europes-10-fastest-growing-digital-health) by headcount in 2023 — has also launched a range of supplements.

### **Cutting costs**

But customer churn has been high. In an interview with Sifted last October, Spector said that “half” of users only subscribe to Zoe for six to nine months before leaving — and the company was focusing on how to “keep people for years”.

While Wolf didn’t want to comment on those figures, he added that the majority of “new” members since that October interview have purchased annual membership.

But in April the company announced it would be making layoffs, as part of measures to cut costs by 20%.

“In 2023 revenue grew massively faster than we were expecting,” says Wolf. “We had long waiting lists — would-be members were complaining.” As a result, Zoe scaled to try and deal with the demand, he tells Sifted.

“We scaled for our forecast of what was going to happen this year,” Wolf says. While the company had a good January, he adds, “suddenly sales were not what we thought they were going to be”.

URL Source: https://sifted.eu/articles/vc-healthtech-ideas/

Markdown Content:
VCs have had an up-and-down relationship with healthtech in the past couple of years.

While investors have remained [fairly bullish](https://sifted.eu/articles/earlybird-raises-173m-fund-news) on biotech companies, the sheen has come off digital health startups — with funding in the sub-sector [dropping further](https://sifted.eu/articles/digital-health-startups-are-running-out-of-cash) than European tech as a whole in 2023 and remaining low into 2024.

But several VCs recently told [Sifted](https://sifted.eu/articles/europe-digital-health-unicorn-hlth) they think investment will begin to pick up in the next year. And there’s real excitement around the potential of AI and the rise of preventative care to positively impact struggling healthcare systems.

They’re both areas that investors say they want to pump money into — as Sifted asks six VCs what healthtech ideas they’re keen to be pitched in 2024.

D2C diagnostics, business intelligence for pharmaceutical companies and tools for hospitals are also featured, as investors from Octopus, Ventures, Speedinvest, Frontline Ventures, InHealth Ventures, Northzone and Nina Capital share their thoughts.

### **D2C health diagnostics**

_Will Gibbs, partner at Octopus Ventures_

![Image 1](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/18164110/Will_Gibbs_Octopus-Ventures_Headshot_1200x675-e1721317281282.png?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)

There is a gap in the market for a healthtech startup that makes annual health MOTs accessible and affordable for consumers. A startup that offers comprehensive assessments at an accessible price point ─ by harnessing AI and advanced diagnostics ─ has the potential to gain significant market share.

A subscription model could provide continuous health monitoring and timely reminders, encouraging yearly check-ups. Partnering with insurers and employers to provide subsidised plans could further increase accessibility, promoting proactive health management and early disease detection.

### **AI-driven business intelligence platforms for pharma**

_Daria Gherghelas, associate at Speedinvest_

![Image 2](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/18164236/Daria-Gherghelas-Speedinvest-e1721317369510.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)

AI paves the way for a new category of software companies with embedded service layers — similar to traditional B2B SaaS customer success teams — selling to pharmaceutical companies.

Commercial intelligence work is still largely outsourced by pharma — which is costly — and presents an opportunity for an AI-native company. Such a business could leverage software to gather and synthesise public and proprietary data on competition, market changes and ongoing clinical trials. Human input can further refine these insights and help pharma manage their portfolio and pipeline of drug candidates.

### **AI tools for hospitals**

_William McQuillan, partner at Frontline Ventures_

![Image 3](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/18164427/WM-2-scaled-1-e1721317482836.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)

An enormous amount of hospital staff and clinicians' time is spent on administrative tasks or triaging patients. On the clinicians' side, I’d like to see startups building new AI tools for enhanced triaging of patients, reducing the time needed for data collection. On the hospital management side, I’d like to see tools for better management of patient data, scheduling and billing. And, on the patient side, I’d like to see AI tools giving better-personalised medicine and enhanced post-hospital/post-operative care as well.

As it currently stands, healthcare systems — and hospitals in particular — are unable to cope with the increase in patient demands from an ageing population. AI is one of the few answers that can make a meaningful impact to increase resources and improve outcomes over the next decade. For this reason, we're seeing a reduction in lead time to sell into hospitals, and at Frontline we believe now is a better time than ever to be building AI tools for this market.

### **Diagnosis and care platforms for neurodegenerative diseases**

_Lavanya Bhamidipati, principal at InHealth Ventures_

![Image 4](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/18164621/InHealth-0068-%C2%A9ivan-weiss_landscape-scaled-e1721317589985.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)

Neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinsons and dementia-type diseases like Alzheimers) have a large economic burden on society — it is estimated that the current cost of dementia alone to the UK is forecast to be [£42 billion](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/how-much-does-dementia-care-cost#:~:text=The%20total%20cost%20of%20dementia,2040%20unless%20action%20is%20taken.), 63% of which is borne by patients and their families.

We need healthtech companies that help with early diagnosis, monitoring and end-to-end management of these conditions.

Companies that use digital biomarkers to recognise early signs of cognitive decline, help patients get access to the right treatments, monitor their symptoms and coordinate care across all stakeholders (healthcare, social care and families) will reduce costs while creating significant patient impact.

### **Health management apps**

_Michiel Kotting, partner at Northzone_

![Image 5](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/18164717/1Q5A3582-scaled-e1721317648903.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)

I would focus on creating an app designed to help patients manage their own health. This app would provide guidance on health-related decisions, help track health data and offer suggestions for treatment options.

While decision support and automation in the medical system through AI and data hold great promise, these require clinical proof, regulatory approval and uptake from medical professionals — an inherently slow and friction-filled process.

In contrast, developing tools to help patients directly manage their health and treatment has a lower barrier to adoption. This approach would initially attract individuals interested in longevity and those managing chronic diseases.

### **Tools for lower-trained healthcare professionals**

_Yahel Halamish, principal at Nina Capital_

![Image 6](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/18164840/NinaCapital03-e1721317730283.jpeg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)

With an ageing population and a rising demand for healthcare services, healthcare systems worldwide are struggling to meet the demand, putting healthcare professionals at risk of burnout.

Tech-enabled tools that help lower-trained employees, such as nursing assistants, to provide care could help address this problem. These tools could continuously monitor patients and translate treatments into simple, easy-to-perform actions. A startup providing a product like this could reduce the load on medical professionals without altering current care pathways and workflows.

Digital health startup Huma raises $80m Series D and makes layoffs
==================================================================

Huma is looking to break-even by the end of 2024 after a year of ""restructuring"" at the startup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5 min read

UK digital health startup Huma is today announcing an $80m Series D round, following a period of “restructuring” at the company that’s seen it lay off some 100 employees in the past year.

The round featured existing investors AstraZeneca, Hitachi Ventures and Leaps by Bayer. New investors also participated — but are undisclosed. The Series D takes Huma’s total funding to around $300m.

The fresh funds were picked up over several smaller injections of capital in the last year, Sifted understands, but cumulatively the total makes up Europe’s largest digital health funding round since the start of 2023.

It follows what Huma founder and CEO Dan Vahdat describes as a number of “efficiency” savings made at the startup in the past 12 months as it has looked to slash its cash burn and move towards profitability.

### **“Shopify for digital health”**

Founded in 2011, Huma builds remote patient monitoring (RPM) solutions for pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers — for use cases like decentralised clinical trials and [“virtual wards”](https://sifted.eu/articles/virtual-ward-doccla-acquisition-news) (a system for tracking patients’ treatment and recovery at home).

It’s partnered with health providers like the NHS and Johns Hopkins University, pharma companies like Bayer and Smith+Nephew, and Chinese tech behemoth Tencent in the past. Huma’s platform is an authorised medical device by regulators in the US, EU and Saudi Arabia.

Previously Huma has worked directly with its customers to build monitoring tools, but in the second half of 2024 it will launch Huma Cloud — a self-service style app builder. Customers will be able to build their own RPM apps, using a prompt inputted into a generative AI-powered search bar or from a template on the platform.

Those apps could focus on RPM for anything from asthma, cancer to diabetes, or data collection for clinical trials, says Vahdat.

“It’s Shopify for digital health. So many companies are built on top of Salesforce or Palantir, and we want to become that type of enabler.”

Vahdat also sees potential for healthtech startup customers. The young companies, he says, often have fewer resources to build out their tech than typical startups, due to the extra costs involved in complying with stringent healthcare regulations.

The big idea is that, because Huma has already built the individual tools that make up an app and gained regulatory approval for its system, startups can build a digital health product for less money on its platform. While pricing is still being finalised, Vahdat says that it will be “consumption-based” and “similar to Shopify”.

Because, theoretically, it will take less Huma person-power to build a health app using the Huma Cloud platform, it will also be more scalable and the margins will be higher for the company, says Vahdat. The product will launch in beta this week, before rolling out more widely towards the end of 2024.

### **Restructuring**

As Huma has looked to improve its margins, the startup has also cut costs over the past year. Part of that has been reducing headcount.

“When you have a platform with regulatory approval, you don’t need a big team to maintain it,” says Vahdat — adding that the costs associated with getting that regulatory approval and building a product from scratch now don’t apply.

He’s also replaced some hires with cheaper alternatives. “We had certain talent that we hired during 2021 and 2022, at the peak of the market, the cost was expensive,” Vahdat says. “We’ve replaced some of this talent with more cost effective options.”

Huma’s headcount has dropped from around 500 when [Sifted reported](https://sifted.eu/articles/uk-healthtech-huma-layoffs) that the company planned to make around 45 layoffs at the end of August 2023 to 400 today. The layoffs come during a difficult time for digital health startups across Europe.

They raised just $1.2bn across 2023 — less than half the $3.1bn picked up during 2021 and the lowest amount since 2018. If H1 numbers are anything to go by, 2024 isn’t looking much brighter.

The harsh funding environment has pulled the path to profitability into sharp focus for many in the sector — and Huma’s no different.

The startup made a loss of £31m in 2022, according to its latest Companies House filings. Numbers for 2023, although not publicly released, were similar, says Vahdat.

However the company is targeting break-even across the year by the end of 2024.

As it moves towards that goal, Vahdat did not rule out further layoffs at the company. “Every company does ‘optimisation’, we’re not going to do anything big,” he tells Sifted.

Huma’s also got one eye on the M&A market.

It has acquired three companies in the past two years — including digital clinical trials startup Alcedis and patient engagement platform iPlato, and one further unannounced company.

The tricky funding environment has “created opportunities” for startups like Huma that do have existing investors with deep pockets, Vahdat says.

“If the funding world had been better, maybe we would have had to pay more or it would have been harder \[to make those acquisitions\],” he tells Sifted. “If we come across \[a business\] with a use case or in a geography that makes sense, we’ll look at it.”

Markdown Content:
Healthtech-1, a UK-based startup developing tech to automate admin in GP practices around the country, has raised a $3.5m seed round.

The round was led by London-based VC Moonfire, and also featured accelerator Y Combinator — which Healthtech-1 participated in last year — alongside a number of angels.

It comes as a [rising number of healthtechs](https://sifted.eu/articles/ai-healthtech-vc-watch) are looking to help tackle staff shortages across healthcare systems in the face of growing — and ageing — populations by automating tasks, both in clinical and admin settings.

Healthtech-1’s first product, which automates new patient registrations, is currently deployed in 10% of GP practices in England, says cofounder Raj Kohli, who launched the company with ex-Monzo engineer Peter Huang. By the end of 2025, it's targeting more than 90%.

### **What problem is Healthtech-1 solving?**

Currently, new patients register themselves at a GP by filling out either an online or paper form with around 18 data points, which is then manually inputted into the practice’s operating system.

“It’s a broken and difficult process which is full of mistakes and manual error,” Kohli says.

Using proprietary algorithms, Healthtech-1’s product conducts identity checks against NHS records, writes the data into the system and flags areas to the practice where they might need to pay special attention, such as around safeguarding.

“If a child tries to register with an uncle \[named as their guardian\] instead of a parent, that’s a safeguarding alert that the GP practice needs to be aware of and take action, just in case of trafficking or something along those lines,” Kohli tells Sifted.

On average, a GP practice will register 71 patients a month, he says — but adds that that figure can rise to up to 1,000 in cities. The startup estimates that it can save practices around 15 minutes of receptionists’ time per registration.

That works out at a cost of £3.75 per registration if a receptionist is paid £15 an hour, Kohli says. Healthtech-1 charges £2 per registration and Kohli tells Sifted the startup has automated over 500k patient registrations.

The startup also launched its second product in February this year, automating the filing of lab results in GP practices — a task which is typically done by doctors themselves. It’s currently live in 31 practices and costs 20p per lab result automated.

### **Doing “deeply unsexy” work**

Those two tasks are just a fraction of more than 70 admin tasks that GP practices have to do, says Kohli. Healthtech-1 mapped these out at the cofounder’s parents’ GP practice in East London — where the startup is also based.

While automating admin in healthcare could be big business, it’s startups working on automating clinical tasks that have raised some of the biggest rounds in the space. Denmark’s [Corti](https://sifted.eu/articles/atomico-gen-ai-healthcare-corti-series-b-news) and France’s [Nabla](https://sifted.eu/articles/nabla-24m-series-b), which both automate note taking for clinical conversations between doctors and patients, raised $60m and $24m respectively in the past year.

“Loads of companies are trying to automate the GP or the doctor — and maybe they’ll be successful — but when you work inside a GP practice you see that the clinical conversation isn’t what needs to be automated, that’s the stuff that GPs are quite good at,” says Kohli.

What needs to be automated are the processes that support that conversation, he tells Sifted — but a lot of businesses have overlooked that “deeply unsexy” work.

Founded in 2021, Healthtech-1 will look to double its headcount of 15 by the end of 2024 as it scales its patient registration tool and its lab results automation product — which it hopes to have in 50% of the more than 6,000 GP practices in England by the end of 2025.

Kohli doesn’t think the startup will need extra funding to get to that point — but further down the line he sees potential for Healthtech-1 to automate communication between GPs and care homes and hospitals.

But for now, Healthtech-1 is focused solely on GP practices, he says: “When [90%](https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2013/11/Call-Action-ACCESSIBLE.pdf) of patient contact happens in primary care, that's how you impact this country.”

Markdown Content:
When Alexis Cholas lost his arm while working as a volunteer combat medic in the Hospitallers Medical Battalion in Eastern Ukraine, he thought his “life was over”.

But six months later, equipped with a sleek black AI-assisted robotic arm made by Ukrainian-US startup Esper Bionics, he was able to return to the frontlines. The device meant the typically life-changing injury, in fact, wasn’t, he tells Sifted.

The prosthetic limb, dubbed the Esper Hand, is built with specially designed muscle sensors that the company says allows users better control and dexterity than others on the market.

But the startup’s not in the prosthetic limb business, says founder and CEO Dima Gazda. Esper is using its robotic arm as a testing platform to develop next generation sensors for a “mass market” — which could be used on wearable devices or implanted inside the body, he tells Sifted.

Gazda is banking on that approach unlocking “way bigger revenue” than the company could if it was focused on only manufacturing prosthetics. Esper has just raised $5m in a funding round led by YZR Capital, with participation from EBRD and U.Ventures.

### **AI-assisted robotic arms**

Esper has been developing its robotic arm since it was founded in Kyiv in 2019, and deployed its prototype to its first user the following year. The startup moved its headquarters to New York in May 2022 — which was delayed a couple of months by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — and also has offices in Berlin. Forty of its 55-strong global team, including the bulk of the company’s R&D, is still based in Kyiv.

Most robotic prosthetic arms use two sensors to control all functions of the hand — detecting movement from the flexor and extensor muscle groups, says Gazda. “It’s like controlling a multifunctional device with only two buttons.” Esper’s device, however, is controlled with the equivalent of around “20 buttons”.

While Gazda is unable to share any specific details about the sensors as he’s worried others may copy them, he says they’ve been developed in-house and collect more data than others on the market, which can then be used to better train the machine learning algorithms the company’s also developed that support how the device moves.

Esper has also built a cloud-based software platform that complements its robotic arm, collecting and processing data and housing its AI control algorithms — which, along with the sensors and prosthetic arm, Gazda calls the “data collection architecture”.

### **The long game**

Esper currently sells its bionic arms via insurers in the US, who pay $22k apiece. That’s about 10% more expensive than the average robotic prosthetic. It sells the device for $7k in Ukraine — which is also the cost of production, meaning the company doesn’t make a profit on those units — funded by donations and the government.

But making revenue from the sale of its bionic arms is “not the main focus”, says Gazda.

“If you are trying to make revenue from day one, you will build products that exactly fit requirements to be reimbursed by insurance companies — but you won’t develop new health technology,” Gazda tells Sifted.

Instead of attempting to take market share with its prosthetic arm, Esper’s activity so far has been an exercise in collecting data that can be used to develop next generation sensors for wearables devices and implants in the future.

These advanced sensors are bulky things when they’re first developed — and wouldn’t fit into the discreet wearables on the market today. But to develop designs and functionality, and eventually reduce their size, they need to be tested on a whole lot of users.

For a wearable like the Oura ring to collect as many data points as Gazda thinks is possible, for example, it would need to be the size of an armband right now — and thousands of people aren’t going to wear that, he says.

But there is a sizeable group of people who are happy to wear a large wearable device — people with prosthetics, Gazda tells Sifted. “It’s smarter to help people who already have big wearable devices like prosthetics, and by doing this you have the expertise to build sensors for smaller devices \[in the future\].”

### **The next steps**

Of the 120 prosthetics currently in use, 80% are in Ukraine and the remainder are in the US; Esper wants to sell 300 more of its robotic arms in the next 12 months, and a big portion of the funding will be spent on upscaling its manufacturing capacity.

But Gazda thinks that most of the startup’s future revenue will come from licensing the sensors it develops out to other wearable manufacturers. It hopes to go to market with that offering in 18-24 months.

While Esper is just developing muscle sensors on its robotic arm at the moment, he says that working with other manufacturers — and using the data collection architecture the company is building — it could develop sensors that pick up a multitude of data points in the future.

These could include things like heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, barometric pressure and temperature, Gazda tells Sifted — along with others he says he can’t reveal at the moment.

URL Source: https://sifted.eu/articles/ai-startups-clinical-trials-cancer-big-pharma-brnd/

Markdown Content:
Clinical trials for cancer therapies are notoriously difficult. According to one study, [97% fail](https://www.vox.com/2019/9/16/20864066/cancer-studies-fail). Scientists are still unclear why only a subset of patients respond to treatments.

But perhaps AI could help.

The industry is now turning to AI to find novel biomarkers which could reveal the underlying causes of vastly different treatment responses across patient populations.

“Biomarker discovery is about truly understanding the biology and mechanism of action of your drug,” says Carolina Haefliger, head of translational medicine at Swiss pharmaceutical company Debiopharm.

Genialis and Nucleai, two startup investments from the company’s venture capital arm, Debiopharm Innovation Fund, promise to transform oncology drug development, as part of the fund’s wider portfolio of clinically-focused AI companies.

We spoke to the startups — and their investors — to find out what they are working on and how these strategic investments helped catalyse transformative collaboration with Debiopharm

### **Focusing on a specific problem** 

Genialis, based in Boston and Ljubljana, is a precision oncology startup focused on transforming drug development through “biology-first”, machine learning-based predictive biomarkers.

“We build machine learning models whose purpose is to help match cancer patients with the right drug for their disease, and we match novel investigational drugs not yet approved to the patients for whom it will have maximum benefit,” says Rafael Rosengarten, Genialis’s CEO and cofounder.

An example of Genialis’s biomarker models is [krasID](https://www.genialis.com/krasid/), which can predict and monitor — with more than 80% accuracy — a patient's response to the inhibition of [KRAS](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00780-4), a gene whose mutations are known to cause up to 20% of all cancers.

> There is a nimbleness, an agility that is found in the world of startups that makes them more focused on one target or technology.

Genialis began building software that could aggregate RNA sequencing data and organise it in a way that makes machine learning effective. It [raised a $13m](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genialis-raises-13m-to-build-clinical-biomarkers-that-predict-patient-response-301784406.html) Series A in 2023, co-led by Debiopharm, and is building out its platform for the clinical development realm.

Like other startups in this space, it's successful where bigger pharma companies seem to fail.

“We are hyper-focused on fixing a specific problem. We are not encumbered by all the vagaries and the distractions and priorities that larger corporations have to deal with,” says Rosengarten.

Marc Cikes, managing director of Debiopharm Innovation Fund, agrees this is where startups can shine.

“There is a nimbleness, an agility that is found in the world of startups that makes them more focussed on one target or technology, and they can develop it with much more flexibility than a big pharmaceutical company,” he says.

### **A dynamic disease** 

As a complex, dynamic disease that constantly evolves to evade the immune system and treatments, cancer is one area where AI-powered drug development could help scientists gain an advantage.

“We must be able to handle very large datasets when identifying biomarkers, this was very difficult before we had these AI tools available, but now we can look at the data to get deeper insights into the biology of tumours and cancer,” says Cikes.

Haefliger adds that combining huge external datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas programme ([TCGA](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga)) with internal datasets could help AI models to get the insights needed to understand cancer.

For example, it took almost 40 years for drugs targeting mutated KRAS to be approved by the FDA, but using the power of biomarkers and AI, Genialis plans to have a platform that is able to build an accurate predictive biomarker for every citizen, for every cancer drug target, to make this process quicker.

Biomarker discovery requires understanding both the biology of a system and the mechanism of a drug developed to treat it. The poor understanding of human disease processes previously hampered biomarker development.

“\[Genialis’s\] approach begins with biology, and it is very different from other companies. We thought it would be useful to solve the questions we have about biomarkers and DNA damage response agents,” says Haefliger. “They may provide an answer that would normally take a lot of resources and time when you need to move a drug through the development path.”

### **Probing complex spatial relationships**

Nucleai is creating AI-driven spatial biomarkers, and uses AI to create a map of cells in biopsy tissue samples that can provide all-important information for a personalised treatment approach.

> We couldn’t find these relationships using traditional methods, so we started working with Nucleai who had the right tools.

“We have developed an AI-driven spatial biology solution that maps cells in biopsies and correlates these maps with other layers of information,” says Avi Veidman, Nucleai’s CEO and cofounder. “In an era where new oncological drugs target specific proteins, Nucleai's solution identifies which patients will respond to these drugs and which are suitable for clinical trials of newly developed treatments.”

Digitised tissue samples can unlock information about more than just one cell.

“Our platform maps the neighbourhood of cells, providing more context and insight into the interplay of cells. This allows pharmaceutical companies to increase the probability of success in clinical trials and enables oncologists to treat patients with the most effective drugs,” says Veidman.

The novelty of its platform attracted Debiopharm, based on a suspicion that targeted therapies may not be successful due to the placement of receptor targets and their relationship to other cells around them.

“We couldn’t find these relationships using traditional methods, so we started working with Nucleai who had the right tools,” says Anna Pokorska-Bocci, principal scientist in personalised medicine at Debiopharm. “We could use molecular information from clinical trial participants and patient response to the drug to feed the Nucleai platform. This analysis allowed us to uncover potential spatial biomarkers that could help predict which patient population could respond to the treatment and which population would not.”

### **Bridging startups and pharma**

Debiopharm Innovation Fund is providing a unique bridge between biotech startups and industry.

> \[Debiopharm Innovation Fund\] are really smart about this technology space adjacent to drug development.

The fund understands the challenges facing large pharmaceutical companies and their R&D constraints and blind spots. Equally, it can shepherd startups through the long and uncertain road from a promising technology to solutions that can be adopted and absorbed by the industry.

“They are really smart about this technology space adjacent to drug development, and they invest in companies that make drug development smarter, faster, cheaper, better, more successful,” says Rosengarten. “They let us look behind the curtain and ask probing questions, allowing us to tailor our solutions to really solve the problem.”

Veidmann agrees, adding that Debiopharm Innovation Fund offers more than just financial backing.

“They provide knowledge, an understanding of pharma, scientific knowledge and expertise,” he says. “They are bringing to the table good connections and the network they have in this domain.”

UK startup Sava raises $8m to develop next-gen continuous glucose monitor
=========================================================================

Balderton backed the startup as it looks to take its device through clinical trials and scale manufacturing capabilities
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As patients and consumers spend more time — and money — on tech to help them monitor their health, a growing [group of startups](https://sifted.eu/articles/aware-amsterdam-lakestar-healthtech-news) are looking to cash in on the trend.

Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) — small devices that usually attach to a user's arm and measure blood sugar levels — have been made famous by London-based company Zoe, one of Europe’s [best funded D2C health techs](https://sifted.eu/articles/zoe-healthtech-cost-cutting-news). Today, fellow UK-based startup Sava is announcing an $8m seed round to develop the next generation of the devices.

The company is building a new type of CGM, which it says will be less invasive and cheaper than current devices and able to monitor a wider range of chronic conditions and biomarkers in the future.

It’s looking to take advantage of the “exploding” CGM market and the “massive greenfield opportunity” in the space, says cofounder and co-CEO Renato Circi.

The raise, led by Balderton Capital and Exor Ventures, takes Sava’s total funding to $13m. The startup will use the money to take its CGM through clinical trials and scale its manufacturing capability.

### **‘Future proofed’ CGM**

Currently, CGMs on the market use a single needle (about 6mm long) to pierce the skin and reach what’s known as interstitial fluid (ISF) — which is found in the spaces between cells and from which blood glucose levels can be measured.

Sava’s CGM also measures glucose levels in the ISF but with several smaller 1mm microneedles — which it calls “microsensors”. That approach comes with several benefits, says Circi.

One is user experience: people are put off by the prospect of putting a needle in their skin and Sava’s smaller microneedles are less intimidating, he argues.

There’s also cost. Manufacturing costs of current CGMs on the market mean that vendors sell the product for £50 for two weeks of monitoring — and only a “fraction of people” have access to them, says Circi. But, when the startup’s manufacturing capabilities are scaled, he hopes Sava will be able to make CGMs “up to 10 times” cheaper than they are currently.

Circi also says that, eventually, because Sava’s device has several sensing microneedles, it will be able to ""future proof"" its CGM so it can measure molecules other than glucose — something that current devices, which only use one needle, aren’t capable of doing.

Sava hasn’t decided which molecules it will expand into next, but Circi tells Sifted it could look at measuring things like ketones, urea, proteins, allergens or alcohol. These biomarkers could be used to analyse sports performance, for example, he adds.

### **A growing market**

CGMs were originally designed for diabetes patients to help them manage their condition, but have recently seen growing usage from consumers looking to keep more aware of their broader health. [Zoe](https://sifted.eu/articles/tim-spector-zoe-health), for example, uses CGMs to help build users’ personalised scores for thousands of foods on its app.

“We believe that D2C markets will be huge,” says Circi. “CGMs won’t just be diabetes, but which use cases will be successful we don’t know.”

It’s this rising awareness of CGMs that helped Sava raise its recent round, says Circi. “When we had conversations with investors three years ago, they were asking us: ‘what is a CGM?’. Over the last couple of years, it’s been ‘I’ve tried a CGM and I’ve seen how it works and there’s something we can do better with them’.”

There are also signs that healthcare providers could also be a fruitful market, says Circi, pointing to the UK’s NHS [making CGMs available](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/type-1-diabetes/managing-blood-glucose-levels/continuous-glucose-monitoring-cgm-and-flash/#:~:text=CGM%20or%20flash%20glucose%20monitoring,CGM%20or%20flash%20glucose%20monitoring.) to all type 1 diabetes patients in recent times.

### **What’s next**

While Sava’s tech isn’t novel — there have been [studies in recent years](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8949222/#:~:text=Each%20microneedle%20is%201%20mm,of%203%20%C3%97%204%20microneedles.) exploring using microneedles for CGM — “no-one has been able to crack it” and release a commercial product so far, says Circi.

That’s because it’s a “very difficult product to build”, says Circi, adding that it’s taken five years for the startup to get to this point and currently 35 of Sava’s 40-strong team are engineers — many of whom have PhDs.

Next up, Sava plans to launch clinical trials with 50 diabetes patients, following it recently gaining approval from the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The majority of the funds will be spent on developing the hardware for its second-generation CGM, which will be smaller than its first, as well as automating manufacturing capabilities to scale up production.

Sava also plans to go back out to fundraise again in the next 12 months, says Circi — as part of its plan to take its first product to market in the next two years.

“It costs tens of millions to take a product like this to market.”

- **Investment Trends**: Two prevailing trends among VCs:
  - Generalist investors have retreated due to long sales cycles and low revenue growth.
  - Specialist healthtech VCs are also feeling the pressure, causing slower fund deployment.
- **Future Potential**: Despite current challenges, there's optimism about areas like AI in healthcare, remote patient monitoring, and preventative care.
- **Missing Unicorns?**: Many believe that promising digital health startups capable of high valuations are yet to emerge in the current landscape.

What innovations do you think could turn the tide? Let’s discuss!

**_This article first appeared in Sifted’s Daily newsletter,_ _[sign up here](https://sifted.eu/newsletters?utm_medium=onsite&utm_source=article&utm_campaign=daily_big_story&utm_content=flagshipnl)._**

Almost exactly one year ago today, behemoth US healthtech conference HLTH, organised by the same people who put on fintech conference Money20/20, held a controversial launch party in Munich ahead of its 2024 event in Amsterdam that kicked off this week — its first on European soil.

The party took place on the first night of Bits & Pretzels’s healthtech conference, also in Munich, and drew several attendees (including this reporter) from that event’s speaker dinner for its own bash. The party was packed and when I arrived a baying mob of conference goers who weren’t wearing wristbands adorned with the HLTH logo were being turned away at the door.

It was a bold entrance to Europe — and it was a sign of things to come. This week its main event in the Dutch capital is similarly showy. Exited founders are playing 8am DJ sets in the “vinyl lounge”; there’s a gaming area with pinball and air hockey; and the Libertines headlined an aftershow party yesterday evening. One VC told me that “everyone is here”.

But one thing that’s struck me is the absence of founders who _everyone_ is talking about on the speaker bill. While a lot of the chatter beforehand was about Babylon’s Ali Parsa being there, he pulled out before doors opened. I haven’t heard much about upcoming digital healthtech darlings who have raised or are about to raise a sector-defining funding round.

Don’t get me wrong, there have been plenty of promising startups on stage creating excited chatter off it. Virtual ward startup [Doccla](https://sifted.eu/articles/12-hospital-tech-startups-to-watch-according-to-vcs?utm_campaign=Sifted%20Daily%20Newsletter&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9TII_iC8UOy2JFWei0lijeaay9GfQ0wsx3ySmUgSUXhIlz9azPLxaTnd2zZ1ZfHJ6UMmdT), alongside AI copilots for doctors [Corti](https://sifted.eu/articles/atomico-gen-ai-healthcare-corti-series-b-news?utm_campaign=Sifted%20Daily%20Newsletter&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9TII_iC8UOy2JFWei0lijeaay9GfQ0wsx3ySmUgSUXhIlz9azPLxaTnd2zZ1ZfHJ6UMmdT) and [Nabla](https://sifted.eu/articles/nabla-24m-series-b?utm_campaign=Sifted%20Daily%20Newsletter&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9TII_iC8UOy2JFWei0lijeaay9GfQ0wsx3ySmUgSUXhIlz9azPLxaTnd2zZ1ZfHJ6UMmdT) are among the few that came up in conversations. The companies that everyone was talking about when they burst onto the scene a few years ago — the likes of Kry, Doctolib and Owkin — were also there.

But digital health startups hitting some serious, unicorn valuations for the first time now? They weren’t at HLTH Europe because, currently, they don’t exist in European digital health, VCs tell me.

The funding figures for the sector paint a telling picture. Digital health startups picked up $1.2bn across Europe in 2023, according to Dealroom — the lowest amount since 2018 and a long drop from the record $3bn in 2021.

Yes, funding across European tech fell across the board, but it fell further in digital health. Halfway through 2024 the numbers aren’t looking more positive. One seasoned founder, who’d just managed to close a round, told me that raising now was more difficult than during the 2008 financial crisis.

So where’s the money gone?

Talking to VCs on the conference floor, broadly speaking there are two schools of thought.

One is that generalist investors who piled into the sector during 2021 have taken flight, put off by long sales cycles and the absence of the kind of revenue growth they’re used to seeing in enterprise SaaS startups. The other is that specialist healthtech VCs are themselves struggling to raise new funds, and are slowing down deployment to make their cash go further.

VCs and founders tell me that they’re not panicking about the low patch, and they think investment will pick up in the next six months to a year.

And there are real areas of promise in the sector. Investors are genuinely excited about the potential of AI to automate processes in healthcare, the future of remote patient monitoring and the rise of preventative care.

Right now, though, it’s difficult to pick the winners.

But what do you think? Am I missing something here? What are the digital health companies that I should have on my radar? Which could be the sector's next unicorn? [Get in touch and let me know](mailto:kai@sifted.eu).

Markdown Content:
Swedish AI startup Tandem Health has raised a $9.5m seed round led by Northzone, alongside angel investors from OpenAI and Deepmind.

Tandem, founded less than a year ago, develops an AI-driven co-pilot for healthcare clinicians that automates administrative tasks, such as transcribing doctor-patient meetings and generating medical notes. It has 50 healthcare providers as customers in Sweden, and is planning European expansion.

“We are essentially interested in all the larger countries around Europe and which country we start in depends on where we find the right partners,” CEO Lukas Saari says.

#### Clinicians in the driving seat

[Since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT](https://sifted.eu/articles/gen-ai-will-transform-healthtech) many startups have doubled down on AI for healthcare providers, including triage systems to help patients understand their symptoms and co-pilots to help practitioners with admin tasks and to help diagnose patients.

Companies like symptom checker app Ada Health and healthcare co-pilot Corti have been working on solutions for years. What differentiates Tandem is that it’s an admin tool for practitioners that helps them transcribe notes from patient-doctor meetings and adds the details to patient journals. It can also help find the right medical codes specific to a patient's symptoms.

“The key feature of our product is what one would call an ambient scribe,” says Saari. “It listens during the patient-doctor conversation, makes a transcription and then creates a draft for a medical note directly afterwards. Instead of the doctor spending 5-10 minutes after a 15-minute patient visit writing everything from scratch or dictating to a medical secretary, the AI generates a draft that can be reviewed and edited in 1-2 minutes.”

#### Based on OpenAI’s GPT and Whisper

Like many other AI startups, Tandem uses GPT-4. It also uses OpenAI’s software for speech recognition and transcription, called Whisper. But Saari says that initially, Whisper struggled in a Swedish medical context because there were many drug names and terms in Swedish that weren’t part of its initial training data.

“What we saw when we started using the product live with real doctors was how you quickly get to a 60% solution that works well as a demo or proof of concept. But then, when you face reality, there is a lot of work to go from 60% to 95% plus in terms of ensuring the right headings \[on documents\] are included, how you express yourself correctly, and so on,” he says.

A single clinic can have 10-20 different patient journal templates. By training Whisper to each clinic's purpose and making sure the tool adds the right information from the doctor-patient meeting in the correct patient journal has given Tandem a competitive advantage Saari says.

“We are moving more and more towards having a self-service flow with the goal that healthcare providers can start using Tandem without really needing to interact with us or without needing our involvement,” he says.

#### Working with a variety of partners

Tandem works with a mix of specialist clinics and general practitioners, which vary in headcount from a few clinicians to around 100. As well as selling to healthcare clinics, it also partners with journal system providers, which means Tandem can reach a larger number of clinics.

Tandem is offering its software as a subscription service, charging 1,500 SEK (around €133), per month per user. It employs 10 people and is looking for large partners to expand overseas across Europe. The secured funding will be used to continue developing the tool and on the expansion.

“The key to our expansion plan is to find large anchor customers or anchor partners. This can be either larger healthcare providers with hundreds or thousands of doctors who see this as something they want to collaborate on, run pilots and start rolling out. Alternatively, with medical record systems that offer it as a solution to their users.”

Markdown Content:
Having blood drawn at startup Aware’s new lab in Amsterdam is a fairly unassuming process. I arrive, am shown to a small office and three vials of blood are taken with minimal fuss. In around 10 minutes I’m back onto the busy morning streets of the Dutch capital.

Within 48 hours the results will be sent to Aware’s app on my phone — showing 44 biomarkers analysing areas like heart, kidney, liver and blood health and explaining what they mean. I’ll be recommended lifestyle advice and can book an appointment with a doctor to discuss my results. My experience was courtesy of Aware — but the standard customer would pay €179 a year for two blood tests and access to its app.

It’s all part of Aware’s goal of tapping into the incoming “generational shift” among consumers towards paying for preventative healthcare solutions, says founder and CEO Florian Meissner.

There are signs of it happening already, as [more](https://www.pymnts.com/healthcare/2022/health-tracking-wearables-and-apps-grew-21-percent-in-past-year/) turn to wearable tech like Apple watches, [Oura rings](https://sifted.eu/articles/smart-ring-oura-superapp-ambitions) and apps to monitor their health. It amounts to a “massive opportunity in the market right now”, Meissner tells Sifted.

The lab in Amsterdam is the sixth the startup has opened — in its third country — since launching its first in Berlin in November 2023. It comes nearly 18 months after bagging a [$15m seed round](https://sifted.eu/articles/blood-test-startup-aware-raises-15m) from investors including Lakestar and Cherry Ventures — and further expansion is on the cards before the year’s out.

### **Diagnostics-as-a-service**

While many digital health startups are struggling to raise money and expand amid [a tough market](https://sifted.eu/articles/digital-health-startups-are-running-out-of-cash), it’s in the direct-to-consumer preventative space that a lot of today’s rare growth stories in the sector can be found.

Spotify’s Daniel Ek’s body scanning startup Neko Health, which has raised €60m from investors including Lakestar and Atomico, [announced](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-eks-body-scanning-neko-health-is-expanding-to-the-uk-news) in April this year that it was expanding to the UK.

There’s also the UK’s Zoe, which provides microbiome testing and lifestyle advice on its app, which has raised $84.5m, according to Dealroom, from the likes of Balderton Capital and Daphni. The startup was one of the [fastest growing](https://sifted.eu/articles/europes-10-fastest-growing-digital-health) startups in the UK in 2023.

Founded in 2021, Aware sells blood tests and access to its app as a subscription model — which can be taken at any of its labs across four cities in Germany, one in Austria and, now, one in the Netherlands. Customers can buy additional tests looking at things like hormone levels and thyroid health.

While Aware hasn’t invented any technology — it uses off-the-shelf equipment in its Berlin lab (the only one it owns) and partners with existing labs in the remaining five locations — it’s ""innovating on business model and service delivery”, says Meissner.

What the startup has built is an app and user interface that can plug into “any lab backend” and allows users to get results from an in-person test back within 48 hours. It can take as long as a week if patients have a blood test in hospital or via their GPs, he adds.

The founder isn’t disclosing customer numbers, but tells Sifted that the number of blood tests Aware has carried out is in ""four figures"".

### **An unsolved market**

The preventative care market is on the up.

Alongside a growing direct-to-consumer segment, as ageing populations put increasing strain on public healthcare systems across the globe, there have been [rising calls](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/02/demos-calls-for-big-rise-in-uk-spending-on-preventative-policies-treasury) for governments to ramp up spending on measures to prevent people from getting sick in the first place.

But there are big challenges facing the sector.

One is European consumers’ aversion to spending on healthcare. The vast majority of health spend in Europe is paid for by the state — and it can be a tough sell to ask customers to fork out sometimes hundreds of pounds in addition to state-provided care.

That’s led to hurdles in convincing consumers to come back as repeat spenders for some.

Zoe founder [Tim Spector told Sifted](https://sifted.eu/articles/tim-spector-zoe-health) in October 2023 that half of its customers only used the platform for six to nine months before leaving and a key focus was convincing them to stay for longer. The startup sells its microbiome testing kits for £300 and an ongoing monthly subscription to an app where users can track health data and access lifestyle advice, which costs up to £60 a month.

In April, Zoe announced it was making layoffs and [cutting costs by 20%](https://sifted.eu/articles/zoe-healthtech-cost-cutting-news) after “over-expanding” the team.

### **‘Trojan horse’**

Price point can hurt a startup’s ability to retain customers, says Meissner, and later this week Aware is launching a more affordable €99 a year subscription — which includes one blood test instead of two.

He also tells Sifted that Aware will reduce in cost over time.

“The tech is getting better and better and the cost of testing machines is moving in one direction,” he says — pointing to genome sequencing testing units, which now cost [less than $1000](https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/analyst-comment/ngs-reduced-cost-personalised-medicine/#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20sequencing%20has,the%20platform%20type%20or%20technology.), down from $100m in 2001.

Eventually, Aware wants to make its blood tests available via public healthcare systems in Europe, says Meissner — but first the startup needs to prove it can run its service at scale.

Alongside opening another two labs in Germany, Aware will roll out in one — if not two — more European countries by the end of 2024, although Meissner is tight-lipped about exactly where.

“It’s fair to say English-speaking countries are low-hanging fruit for us,” he says. Countries like the UK and Nordics are both attractive, he adds, alongside others in southern Europe like Italy, Spain and Portugal.

Further down the line, Aware could also broaden its diagnostics offering to include STI and microbiome testing, says Meissner. It also hopes to begin collecting data from wearables like an Apple watch and combine them with results from physical tests to offer more bespoke lifestyle advice.

“We always joked that we built a trojan horse with our blood-based service,” says Meissner. “The goal is to offer any \[test\] a laboratory would offer and be the front end for this market.”

Daniel Ek’s body scanning healthtech Neko Health is expanding to the UK
=======================================================================

The company raised €60m for international expansion in July last year
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[Mimi Billing](https://sifted.eu/author/mimibilling/)

2 min read

Spotify founder Daniel Ek’s healthtech startup Neko Health opened its first body scanning facility in Stockholm in February last year and has gone on to complete 3,000 scans. Now it’s [heading to London](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nilsonne_london-we-are-coming-activity-7190613829859315713-4QsD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) with a launch planned for this summer.

In February last year, the Swedish company raised a [€60m Series A](https://sifted.eu/articles/neko-health-raises-series-a-news), led by Lakestar with the participation of Atomico and General Catalyst, for European expansion. At the time, the company didn’t want to specify which countries it had in mind.

Neko Health’s main product is a [full-body scanning system](https://sifted.eu/articles/ek-neko-body-scanner-test) for broad and non-invasive health data collection, which the company wants to make quicker, more convenient and more affordable. By catching potential diseases earlier, it hopes to increase the chances of treating them and reduce the cost of healthcare in the long term.

Within hours of its official launch in February last year, all the slots at its first body-scanning clinic in Stockholm had sold out.

The body-scanning procedure takes 10-15 minutes and is followed by a consultation with a doctor. Neko says its scanner uses over 70 sensors to collect 50m data points and can, for instance, detect tiny skin changes. That could help doctors detect diseases like skin cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other metabolic syndromes earlier.

A scan will set you back €250 but the fee doesn’t seem to put people off. Neko has 20k patients on its waiting list in Sweden and has opened its international waiting list, the company says, where plenty of Brits have signed up.

### Origin story

The startup, founded by Daniel Ek and entrepreneur Hjalmar Nilsonne in 2018, was in stealth until its official launch last year. Before launching its body scanning facility the company opened [a primary care clinic](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-ek-secret-healthtech-startup) in Stockholm, which the founders are still running alongside the body scanning facility.

Before raising its Series A, Ek invested about €30m in the company, partly through his moonshot investment vehicle Prima Materia.

The UK has seen the [most investments in longevity](https://sifted.eu/pro/briefings/longevity-2024) in Europe — making London a natural choice for Neko.

2024-08-28 11:00:00,2024-08-30 00:35:39,"🔑 **Key Insights on Kidney Donor Mortality Trends**

- **Significant Decline Over 30 Years**: Perioperative mortality among living kidney donors has decreased dramatically, with less than 1 death per 10,000 donations in the last decade.
- **Demographic Differences**: Higher risk noted for male donors (4.0 per 10,000) compared to females (1.0 per 10,000).
- **Hypertension Risks**: Donors with a history of hypertension face greater mortality risks (7.5 per 10,000) versus those without (1.4 per 10,000).
- **Surgical Procedure Impact**: Open procedures carry a higher mortality risk (4.3 per 10,000) compared to laparoscopic methods (1.9 per 10,000).
- **Update Guidelines**: Current informed consent guidelines, based on older data, need revision to reflect these reduced mortality rates.

These evolving trends pose important considerations for clinical practice and donor selection protocols.

Kidney Donor Mortality Plummets Over 30 Years
=============================================

Edited by Manasi Talwadekar

August 28, 2024

**TOPLINE:**
------------

The risk for perioperative mortality among living kidney donors has significantly declined over the past 30 years, with the most recent decade showing less than one death per 10,000 donations. Male donors and those with a history of [hypertension](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/241381-overview) are found to have higher mortality risks.

**METHODOLOGY:**
----------------

*   With evolving treatment trends in donor selection, perioperative care, and surgical technique, prior estimates of perioperative mortality may not reflect current risks. It's important for living kidney donor candidates to be informed of these updated risks.
*   The researchers analyzed data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients on 164,593 living kidney donors from 1993 to 2022.
*   Mortality ratios within 90 days of donation were calculated and stratified across three eras: 1993-2002, 2003-2012, and 2013-2022.
*   Death events were captured from multiple sources, including the Organ Procurement & Transplantation Network (OPTN) and the Limited Access Death Master File provided by the National Technical Information Service.
*   Mortality risk was compared across subgroups by age, sex, race and ethnicity, type of procedure, body mass index, and history of hypertension.

**TAKEAWAY:**
-------------

*   The risk for perioperative mortality among living kidney donors was comparable in 1993-2002 (3.0 per 10,000 donations) and 2003-2012 (2.9 per 10,000 donations) and then declined significantly in 2013-2022 (0.9 per 10,000 donations; _P_ = .01).
*   The risk for mortality was higher among male donors than among female donors (4.0 vs 1.0 per 10,000 donations).
*   Donors with a history of hypertension had a higher mortality rate than those without a history of hypertension (7.5 vs 1.4 per 10,000 donations; _P_ = .03).
*   The risk for mortality was higher for donors who underwent open procedures (4.3 per 10,000 donations) than for those who underwent laparoscopic procedures (1.9 per 10,000 donations), although this difference was not statistically significant.

**IN PRACTICE:**
----------------

""Perioperative mortality after living donation declined substantially in the past decade compared with prior decades to fewer than one event per 10,000 donations,"" the authors wrote. ""Current guidelines for donor informed consent, based on 2009 data, should be updated to reflect this information,"" they added.

**SOURCE:**
-----------

The study was led by Allan B. Massie, PhD, Department of Surgery, NYU Langone Health, New York City. It was [published online](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2024.14527) on August 28, 2024, in _JAMA_.

**LIMITATIONS:** 
-----------------

The study's power to estimate relative risks was limited due to the small number of perioperative deaths over 30 years. Additionally, follow-up may be incomplete, although stricter OPTN requirements since 2013 may have mitigated this issue.

**DISCLOSURES:**
----------------

The study was supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Some authors reported receiving grants from the National Institutes of Health or compensation such as speaker fees, honoraria, or consulting fees from various pharmaceutical companies. One author reported serving as the director of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.

TOPLINE:
--------

Menopausal vasomotor symptoms (VMS, also known as hot flashes) and sleep disturbance are common and undertreated. Two phase 3 trials of the novel non-hormonal drug elinzanetant show safety and efficacy against moderate to severe VMS and sleep disturbance. The drug targets for inhibition of the hypothalamic neurons expressing the neurokinin-1,3 receptor that mediate VMS.

METHODOLOGY:
------------

*   OASIS 1 (n = 309) and OASIS 2 (n = 324) are two randomised double-blind phase 3 trials of elinzanetant conducted in North America, Europe, and Israel.
*   Both trials administered once daily oral elinzanetant, 120 mg, for 14 weeks.
*   The primary outcomes were the mean change in frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS from baseline to weeks 4 and 12 using electronic hot flash daily diary.
*   The secondary outcomes were the improvement in patient-reporting sleep disturbance at week 12 using short-form 8b derived from the PROMIS SD questionnaire and quality of life using the Menopause-specific Quality-of-Life questionnaire.

TAKEAWAY:
---------

*   At week 4, 62.8% (Oasis 1) and 62.2% (OASIS 2) of participants receiving elinzanetant realised at least a 50% reduction in VMS frequency vs 29.2% and 32.3% of placebo recipients, respectively. Severity of VMS was also improved relative to placebo.
*   At week 12, 71.4% (Oasis 1) and 74.7% (OASIS 2) of participants receiving elinzanetant realised at least a 50% reduction in VMS frequency vs 42.0% and 48.3% of placebo recipients, respectively. Severity was also improved relative to placebo.
*   Both sleep disturbance and quality of life also showed improvement at week 12.
*   Elinzanetant displayed a favourable safety profile.

IN PRACTICE:
------------

The authors concluded that ""Elinzanetant has the potential to provide a well-tolerated and efficacious non-hormonal treatment option to address the unmet health needs of many menopausal individuals with moderate to severe VMS.""

An [accompanying editorial](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822768) observed that ""...\[I\]t seems we have entered a new era in which menopause management can be individualised…With the discovery of non-hormonal treatment options…menopause care should advance on this solid scientific footing to benefit affected individuals.""
