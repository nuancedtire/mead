The doctor, wearing a white coat and stethoscope, is pointing to a digital tablet displaying a graph illustrating cardiovascular risks associated with gout. The patient, a middle-aged male with a concerned expression, is seated across from her, looking intently at the screen. 

The clinic is bright and well-lit, with medical posters on the walls about gout and cardiovascular health. A window in the background allows natural light to flood the room, creating a warm yet urgent atmosphere. Use a shallow depth of field to focus on the interaction between the doctor and patient, while softly blurring the background elements. The color palette should include calming blues and whites, emphasizing a professional and reassuring environment. Capture the mood of urgency and importance in addressing cardiovascular health in patients with gout."

Don't overlook the cardiovascular risks! \n\nRecent research highlights a concerning trend: \n- Patients face a 3.9% risk of cardiovascular events within 2 years of a gout diagnosis. \n- The risk is particularly pronounced in the first month, with 31.2 events per 1000 person-years compared to 21.6 events in the following months. \n- Women experience a greater elevation in risk compared to men. \n- Early intervention with colchicine on the day of diagnosis can significantly reduce this risk (adjusted incidence rate ratio of 0.84). \n\nThese findings underscore the importance of proactive cardiovascular risk management right from the first gout consultation. \n\nHow are you addressing cardiovascular health in your patients with newly diagnosed gout?", ['Healthcare & Policy', 'Gout', 'CardiovascularHealth', 'Inflammation', 'HealthcareProfessionals'], 'https://fal.media/files/monkey/-F3INC-OTrgJsSesvz35S.png', 'http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/cardiovascular-risk-merits-attention-newly-diagnosed-gout-2024a1000gvv', 'You are a content strategist specializing in crafting engaging and informative social media posts for healthcare professionals based on detailed medical articles or web content. Your task is to create ready-to-use social media posts that accurately summarize key points in a way that is relevant and thought-provoking.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n - Engaging Openers: Start with a creative hook that grabs attention—use clinical scenarios, surprising statistics, or thought-provoking questions (without relying on overused phrases like “Did you know?”).\n - Informative Content: Provide a concise yet comprehensive summary of the most important information, ensuring clarity and relevance to healthcare professionals.\n - Balanced Tone: Maintain a professional yet approachable tone. Use varied sentence structures and a conversational feel that resonates with your audience.\n - Highlight Key Findings: Use bullet points to present important statistics or findings, making the information easy to read and digest.\n - Foster Engagement: Conclude with a thoughtful question or statement that encourages reflection or invites interaction, ensuring it feels natural and appropriate.\n - Emojis Usage: Use emojis sparingly and strategically to emphasize key points or statistics, while maintaining professionalism.\n - Formatting: Deliver the final post as plain text, formatted for easy reading without the need for Markdown or HTML.\n\nKey Focus:\n\n - Clarity and Comprehensiveness: Ensure the post covers essential details to inform healthcare professionals effectively.\n - Readability: Use bullet points and varied sentence lengths to enhance readability.\n\nAn Example Post:\n\n⏱️ A weekly insulin dose that matches daily treatments in efficacy—could this reshape type 2 diabetes care?\n\nIn the QWINT-2 phase 3 trial, once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa demonstrated:\n\n - A1C reduction of 1.34% vs. 1.26% with daily insulin degludec, resulting in A1C levels of 6.87% and 6.95% respectively at 52 weeks.\n - 45 minutes more time in range per day without increased hypoglycemia risk.\n - A safety profile similar to daily insulins, with no severe hypoglycemic events reported for efsitora.\n\nCould once-weekly dosing improve adherence and reduce treatment burden for your patients?', 'Cardiovascular Risk Merits Attention in Newly Diagnosed Gout\n===============\n\nThis site is intended for UK healthcare professionals\n\nTOPLINE:\xa0\n---------\n\nPatients have an increased risk for cardiovascular events in the first month after a gout diagnosis that appears related to inflammation.\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n------------\n\n*   Investigators analysed data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Database-GOLD and linked databases.\n*   They conducted a cohort study among 76,440 patients with newly diagnosed gout and a self-controlled case series study among 4398 patients who had a cardiovascular event in the 2 years before or after gout diagnosis.\n*   The main outcome was a first cardiovascular event (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischaemic attack).\n\nTAKEAWAY:\n---------\n\n*   In the cohort study, 3.9% of patients experienced a cardiovascular event in the 2 years after gout diagnosis.\n*   The incidence of events was higher during days 1-30 postdiagnosis vs days 31-730 postdiagnosis (31.2 vs 21.6 events/1000 person-years).\n*   In the self-controlled case series, the incidence was higher in the 30 days after gout diagnosis compared with the patient\'s own baseline period (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.55) and especially in the first 15 days (1.70).\n*   Findings were similar regardless of age, comorbidities, and diuretic use, but the elevation of risk was greater for women than for men.\n*   The association was largely attenuated when colchicine was prescribed the day of gout diagnosis (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.84) and somewhat attenuated when non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed that day (1.39).\n\nIN PRACTICE:\n------------\n\n"First gout diagnosis was associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events in the short term. Inflammation during the first gout flare is the most plausible explanation for this association," the authors wrote. "These findings support the need for cardiovascular risk management from the time of first gout consultation," they concluded.\n\nSOURCE:\n-------\n\nThe study was led by Edoardo Cipolletta, MD, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK, and Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy, and was published online in _Arthritis & Rheumatology_.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n------------\n\nLimitations included uncertainty about the time of onset of gout symptoms, failure to capture milder flares, possible unmeasured confounding, and lack of adjudication of cardiovascular events.\n\nDISCLOSURES:\n------------\n\nThe study was funded in part by the University of Nottingham.

Here’s what we learned:\n\n- GLYCOSYLATION PATTERNS MATTER: Increased fucosylation and sialylation of serum proteins correlate with poorer outcomes for patients treated with nivolumab (Opdivo) plus cabozantinib (Cabometyx) compared to sunitinib (Sutent).\n- POTENTIAL PREDICTIVE BIOMARKERS: High serum levels of CO3 glycopeptide may indicate a favorable response to the nivolumab-cabozantinib combination, while low levels of CFAH glycopeptide suggest a similar trend.\n- CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study emphasizes the need for effective biomarkers to identify which patients will benefit most from anti–PD-1 therapies, as current genomic approaches may not capture the full picture.\n- LONG-TERM EFFICACY: The combination therapy continues to show significant improvements in progression-free survival (16.4 months vs. 8.4 months) and overall survival (46.5 months vs. 36.0 months) compared to sunitinib.\n\nAs we delve deeper into the complexities of protein glycosylation, could these findings pave the way for personalized treatment strategies in RCC? \n\n#KidneyCancer #Oncology #Biomarkers #ClinicalResearch', ['Research & Clinical Trials', 'KidneyCancer', 'Oncology', 'Biomarkers', 'ClinicalResearch'], 'https://fal.media/files/lion/2IlmHv7U3lDJrD8r4tlLn.png', 'https://www.targetedonc.com/view/first-line-treatment-for-kidney-cancer-new-data-strengthens-combo-approach', 'You are a content strategist specializing in crafting engaging and informative social media posts for healthcare professionals based on detailed medical articles or web content.

Braun, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine (Medical Oncology) and Louis Goodman and Alfred Gilman Yale Scholar at Yale School of Medicine, in New Haven, Connecticut. Specifically, high serum levels of CO3 glycopeptide are potentially predictive of favorable response to the nivolumab plus cabozantinib vs sunitinib, as are low serum levels of CFAH glycopeptide.\n\n“We see that higher amounts of protein glycosylation, both sialylation and fucosylation, appear to be prognostic in this data set, and that specific protein glycosylation events related to lipid metabolism, but also related to the complement cascade, have the potential to [possibly] be predictive of response in anti–PD-1-based therapy, as opposed to sunitinib,” Braun said in a presentation of the data. “But I want to highlight this is really early exploratory work. I [believe] the main question is, is this an area for further investigation in biomarker development in RCC? And I [believe] the answer to that is, yes.”\n\nCheckMate-9ER enrolled patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with a clear cell component. They could have disease of any risk by International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria, but they needed to have tumor tissue available for analysis.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 240 mg of intravenous (IV) nivolumab every 2 weeks paired with 40 mg of oral cabozantinib once daily vs 50 mg of oral sunitinib on a cycle of 4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off. Treatment continued until disease progression by RECIST v1.1 criteria or intolerable toxicity. Stratification factors included IMDC risk score, tumor PD-L1 expression, and geographic region.\n\nThe primary end point of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review committee (BICR) and RECIST 1.1 criteria. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) by BICR and RECIST 1.1 criteria, as well as safety. Health-related quality of life served as an important exploratory end point.\n\nIn January 2021, the FDA approved nivolumab plus cabozantinib for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC based on earlier data from CheckMate-9ER. Data from the 55-month follow-up of the study shared during the 2024 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium showed that nivolumab plus cabozantinib continues to provide a meaningful improvement over sunitinib in PFS, OS, and ORR. In the intention-to-treat population, the PFS by BICR was 16.4 months (95% CI, 12.5-19.3) with the doublet vs 8.4 months (95% CI, 7.0-9.7) with sunitinib (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49-0.70). The median OS with nivolumab plus cabozantinib was 46.5 months (95% CI, 40.6-53.4) vs 36.0 months (95% CI, 29.2-42.8) with sunitinib (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95). The ORR by BICR was 55.7% with the doublet vs 27.7% with sunitinib.\n\n“[Although] anti–PD-1–based therapy is really the standard for first-line RCC, we still lack effective biomarkers to figure out which patients are likely to respond, and which tumors are likely to be resistant to therapy. Our group, and many others, have focused largely on the genomics and transcriptomics of the tumor itself, but we know that posttranslational modifications of proteins themselves play an important role in those proteins’ function,” Braun said. “In fact, glycosylation of protein, altered glycosylation, is a hallmark of cancer and involved in many malignant processes. Hypersialylation in particular, engages sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin receptors and is known to be immunomodulatory, potentially raising the idea that it could contribute to anti–PD-1 resistance.”\n\nFor the post hoc analysis, Braun and colleagues evaluated the link between site-specific glycopeptide modifications with nivolumab plus cabozantinib/sunitinib response in patients with advanced RCC by leveraging pre-treatment serum samples. They used the InterVenn GlycoVision platform to conduct a glycoproteomic analysis, to understand if altered protein glycosylation is a possible avenue for biomarker studies in RCC. They identified 24 serum glycopeptides that were linked with PFS or OS with the doublet.\n\n“The first question is, how are these regulated? Are they regulated in a coordinated fashion or not? We looked across patients for site-specific protein glycosylation, [and what] we can see is highly coordinated modules of altered protein glycosylation, [with] red piercing correlations across patients for these different site-specific glycosylations,” Braun said. “Now, in our initial study and our initial look at these particular proteins, we can see that these coordinated modules seem to be associated with altered PFS and OS with nivolumab plus cabozantinib, either positively or negatively. So, this gave us some initial insight for further study, that these are highly coordinated and potentially associated with clinical outcome.”\n\nBraun added that the next question posed by the investigators was whether the total amount of glycosylation is important and if it plays a role in clinical outcomes. To that end, they examined the total amount of 2 forms of glycosylation: sialyation and fucosylation.\n\n“We see basically an increasing amount of glycosylation, the number of amino acid residues that have a sialic acid or a fucose residue. As we can see, for both nivolumab [plus] cabozantinib and sunitinib, when you have more glycosylation, you have a higher hazard ratio, [which is] essentially worse PFS and OS with more protein glycosylation,” Braun explained. “This at least raises the potential that this could be prognostic and really reinforces prior studies seen in melanoma. So that’s a potential prognostic role.”\n\nThey then set out to evaluate whether this marker could be predictive for response to the doublet vs the monotherapy. When they look across several protein glycosylations, 2 patterns emerged, Braun noted. “One, proteins involved in lipid metabolism, and the second were members of the complement cascade,” he said. “One is CO3. And what we can see is that at low levels of protein glycosylation, there’s [essentially] no difference between nivolumab plus cabozantinib or sunitinib with respect to PFS, but at high levels of protein glycosylation, this is where we see tremendous benefit from nivolumab plus cabozantinib. This is hypothesis generating. This is a proinflammatory complement protein, so could this be mediating complement-induced antitumor activity?”\n\nThe opposite pattern was observed for CFAH glycopeptide. He noted that high levels of the checkpoint did not show benefit from the doublet whereas when the protein glycosylation was low, substantial benefit was observed with the combination. “The hypothesis is that this negative regulator of alternate complement activity, when it’s low, that’s when the immune therapy is able to act,” Braun said.\n\nHe concluded that the prognostic or predictive potential of glycopeptide biomarkers should be further examined in additional clinical trials.\n\n_Disclosures: Dr Braun shared that he has a non-CE consulting relationship with Cancer Expert Now, Adnovate Strategies, MDedge, CancerNetwork, Catenion, OncLive, Cello Health BioConsulting, PWW Consulting, Haymarket Medical Network, Aptitude Health, ASCO Post/Harborside, Targeted Oncology, Merck, Pfizer, MedScape, Accolade 2nd MD, DLA Piper, AbbVie, Compugen, Link Cell Therapies, Scholar Rock, and NeoMorph.

Higher levels of leptin, a hormone that helps maintain normal body weight, is associated with better signal-transmitting brain white matter in middle-aged adults, according to a study by The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio).\n\n"The findings support the known role of leptin variations in late-life dementia risk by relating its deficiency with changes in white matter structure, which is an early event in the process of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer\'s disease or vascular dementia," said Claudia Satizabal, Ph.D., associate professor at the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer\'s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio.\n\nSatizabal is lead author of a study titled "Leptin bioavailability and markers of brain atrophy and vascular injury in the middle age," published Aug. 12 in Alzheimer\'s & Dementia. Other authors also are with the Biggs Institute, as well as Tufts Medical Center in Boston; the Framingham Heart Study; Boston University School of Public Health; University of California-Davis; National and Kapodistrian University of Athens; and Columbia University.\n\nObesity and Alzheimer\'s\n-----------------------\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease is the leading cause of dementia, impacting the lives of millions of people worldwide, the study notes. Increasing evidence suggests that midlife obesity is an important contributor to the risk of developing the disease.\n\nThis has led to a growing interest in untangling the mechanisms linking obesity to Alzheimer\'s, which potentially extend through vascular, genetic and metabolic pathways. The study of adipose or fatty tissue has led to significant insights.\n\nOnce viewed as a passive reservoir for energy storage, adipose tissue is now considered a part of the endocrine system, secreting a group of bioactive peptides known as adipokines, or cell-signaling molecules that play functional roles in the energy or metabolic status of the body, inflammation and obesity.\n\nLeptin is an adipokine responsible for central control of food intake and energy homeostasis, and has been implicated in a variety of neurophysiological functions, including brain development, neurogenesis and neuroprotection.\n\nBecause of these effects, it has been considered a plausible mechanism in the pathway leading from obesity to Alzheimer\'s disease. It is supported by findings tying higher leptin levels to lower risk for incident Alzheimer\'s disease and mild cognitive impairment, as well as better structural brain indicators in older adults, the study notes.\n\nStill, studies conducted in younger individuals have not detected associations between leptin and early indicators of brain damage preceding late-life dementia risk. Researchers in the new study at UT Health San Antonio aimed to gain further insights into the potential relationships of leptin with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular burden.\n\nSpecifically, they investigated the associations of leptin markers with cognitive function and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of brain atrophy and vascular injury in healthy middle-aged adults.\n\nThey conducted neuropsychological evaluations of 2,262 cognitively healthy participants from the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term cardiovascular cohort study of residents from Framingham, Massachusetts, spanning three generations and now a project of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, in collaboration with Boston University.\n\nThe scientists measured concentrations of leptin, its soluble leptin receptor and their ratio, known as the free leptin index, indicating leptin bioavailability, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Cognitive and MRI measures were derived using standardized protocols.\n\nThe results found a higher association of the soluble leptin receptor with lower fractional anisotropy, a biomarker of brain white-matter integrity, and peak-width skeletonized mean diffusivity, an imaging marker for white-matter injury. Correspondingly, a higher free leptin index was associated with higher fractional anisotropy.\n\nThese results were replicated in a study that included 89 cognitively healthy Hispanic participants from San Antonio, by MarkVCID, a consortium of U.S. academic medical centers whose mission is to identify and validate biomarkers for the small vessel diseases of the brain that produce vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).\n\nTaken together, the researchers concluded that higher leptin bioavailability was associated with better white-matter integrity in healthy middle-aged adults, supporting the putative neuroprotective role of leptin in late-life dementia risk.\n\nMore information: Sokratis Charisis et al, Leptin bioavailability and markers of brain atrophy and vascular injury in the middle age, Alzheimer\'s & Dementia (2024).

The FDA granted F2G a breakthrough designation for olorofim in 2019.\n\nSince the first filing, F2G has completed a phase 2b study in patients with invasive aspergillosis, scedosporiosis, lomentosporiosis, fusariosis, scopulariopsis, and coccidioidomycosis infections and limited treatment options – which was ongoing when the FDA turned down the application in June 2023.\n\nIt has also started a 225-subject phase 3 trial called OASIS, comparing treatment with olorofim to Astellas\' AmBisome (liposomal amphotericin B) in invasive aspergillosis, which should generate results next year.\n\nInvasive aspergillosis is a serious infection that typically affects people with compromised immune systems and there are rising rates of resistance to azoles and amphotericin B, the two most effective classes of treatment.\n\nThe new financing was led by the AMR Action Fund, said to be the world\'s largest public-private partnership investing in the development of new antimicrobial therapeutics, and backed up by existing investors Novo Holdings, Advent Life Sciences, Sofinnova Partners, Forbion, Blue Owl Healthcare Opportunities, Morningside Ventures, Brace Pharmaceuticals, and Merifin Capital.\n\n"For decades, clinicians have relied on a handful of antifungal classes, with few mechanisms of action and significant limitations due to spectrum of activity, drug toxicities, or drug-drug interactions," said AMR Action Fund\'s chief executive Henry Skinner, who has joined the board of F2G.\n\n"These therapies are increasingly failing in patients," he added. "We are thrilled to support F2G\'s team as they develop this urgently needed therapy and seek regulatory approval."\n\nOlorofim is licensed in Europe and Asia to Japanese pharma Shionogi, which paid $100 million upfront for rights to the drug in 2022, with F2G retaining rights in North America. F2G\'s last fundraising was in a $70 million round led by Forbion and Sofinnova two years ago.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

At the European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meeting, University of Colorado researchers presented more data from their institution of adults with type 1 diabetes who used tirzepatide as well as semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy, Novo Nordisk) off-label.\n\nData were derived from Snell-Bergeon J, et al. OP 43. Presented at: European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting; Sept. 9-13, 2024; Madrid.\n\n“Off-label semaglutide and tirzepatide treatment resulted in significant weight loss and improved glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes, with no reported hospitalization for hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis,” Janet Snell-Bergeon, PhD, professor of pediatrics at the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said during the presentation.\n\nResearchers conducted a retrospective chart review of 50 adults with type 1 diabetes and overweight or obesity who used semaglutide off-label and 50 adults who used tirzepatide off-label. Propensity score matching was used to compare data from semaglutide and tirzepatide users with 50 controls with type 1 diabetes and overweight or obesity who were not treated with either medication. Changes in BMI, body weight and HbA1c were assessed over a 1-year period.\n\nReductions in weight, HbA1c\n\nAdults using tirzepatide had a 7.5 kg/m2 decline in BMI and semaglutide users a 3 kg/m2 decrease in BMI from baseline to 12 months (P for treatment difference < .0001). The tirzepatide group had a significantly greater reduction in BMI than controls starting at 3 months and continuing until the end of the study, whereas semaglutide users had a significantly greater decrease in BMI than controls beginning at 6 months and continuing through 1 year.\n\nThe tirzepatide group lost 21.4% of their body weight from baseline to 1 year and the semaglutide group achieved a 9.1% weight reduction in that same period (P for treatment difference < .0001). A weight loss of 10% or more at 1 year was achieved by 87% of adults using tirzepatide and 47% of those using semaglutide compared with no participants in the control group (P < .001).\n\nAdults using semaglutide had a 0.54 percentage point decline in HbA1c at 1 year compared with a 0.68 percentage point decrease for those using tirzepatide. Both decreases were greater than the change in the placebo group (P = .008).\n\nChange in total, basal and bolus insulin daily dose was significantly lower for adults using tirzepatide than those using semaglutide or controls. At 1 year, there was no significant difference in the change in total, basal or bolus insulin dose between the semaglutide and control groups.\n\n“When we looked at total insulin dose per kilogram of body weight, there was a significant decrease [with tirzepatide], indicating that this went beyond just the loss of body weight and perhaps improved insulin sensitivity,” Snell-Bergeon said.\n\nThe change in BMI, body weight and HbA1c did not differ between adults receiving multiple daily insulin injections and those using an insulin pump. Snell-Bergeon said there was a trend toward greater HbA1c loss for adults receiving tirzepatide and using an insulin pump vs. semaglutide users or those using tirzepatide with multiple daily injections.\n\nDosing and safety\n\nPeople using semaglutide began at a starting dose of 0.25 mg per week and were titrated up based on clinical guidelines. Of the group, 38 reached a maximum dose of 0.5 mg per week. For those using tirzepatide, the starting dose was 2.5 mg per week. Of the tirzepatide group, 16 reached a maximum dose of 5 mg, eight reached a maximum dose of 7.5 mg and 14 reached a maximum dose of 10 mg.\n\nThere were no reports of hospitalizations for DKA or hypoglycemia during the study. Three adults using semaglutide and one using tirzepatide discontinued the medication due to lack of response.\n\nSnell-Bergeon said randomized controlled trials still need to be conducted to assess efficacy and safety outcomes for both medications among adults with type 1 diabetes.\n\nPublished by: \n\nSources/DisclosuresCollapse\n\nSource:\n\nSnell-Bergeon J, et al.

This approval is supported by findings from the 2/3 KEYNOTE-483 trial (NCT02784171). Here, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the firstline led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) vs chemotherapy alone.\n\nThe FDA has granted approval to the first-line treatment of pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\nData from the randomized, open-label, phase 2/3 KEYNOTE-483 trial (NCT02784171) support this approval. According to findings presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, the combination of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy led to a statistically significant improvement in OS, reducing the risk of death by 21% (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.98; 2-sided P =.0324). The median OS with the combination was 17.3 months (95% CI, 14.4-21.3) vs 16.1 months (95% CI, 13.1-18.2) with chemotherapy alone.\n\nA significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) was also observed with the combination. The PFS was 7.13 months (HR, 0.80; 95%CI, 0.65-0.99; 2-sided P =.0372) with the combination vs 7.16 months with chemotherapy, and at 12 months, the estimated PFS rates across arms were 26% and 17%, respectively. The overall response rate (ORR) was also significantly higher for the pembrolizumab combination at 62% vs 38% with chemotherapy alone (P <.0001).\n\nFor safety, the safety profile of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in this study was consistent with what has been previously reported.\n\nThose with measurable disease; an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; and adequate hematologic, liver, and renal function and those who had no contraindications to standard chemotherapy were eligible for enrollment in the study. Patients must have also been eligible to receive standard chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin and must have been incurable with use of standard therapies to be included in the study. Patients were permitted to have had prior radiation at least 28 days prior to registration; however, radiation to the thorax was not allowed unless clear disease progression was seen. Further, patients were permitted to have undergone previous major surgery at least 28 days prior to registration.\n\nThere were 440 patients enrolled during the phase 3 portion and randomized to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab given intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles in combination with 500 mg/m2 of pemetrexed every 3 weeks for 6 cycles and 75 mg/m2 of cisplatin every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Patients also could have been given pemetrexed plus cisplatin alone. Cisplatin could be substituted with carboplatin at an area under the curve of 5 or 6 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles in either arm.\n\nREFERENCES:  \n1.

Participants were aged at least 50 years or at least 18 years with a comorbidity, and 99.1% had received a previous dose of COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe researchers found that vaccinated participants treated with the antiviral experienced fewer and less severe COVID-19 symptoms, accessed health care less often and took less time off work 6 months after recovery, “but with small effect sizes” and “high numbers needed to treat.”\n\nSpecifically, among participants in the treatment arm, molnupiravir was associated with a 1.9% reduction in severity of any severe symptoms and a 2.5% reduction in severity of persistent symptoms after 6 months. The number of participants needed to treat to achieve the benefit were 52.6 and 40, respectively.\n\n“The promising results from the PANORAMIC trial are consistent with results from well-conducted observational analyses as they both converge on finding a modest effect of molnupiravir in reducing the risk of long COVID in high-risk individuals,” Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development services at Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System, wrote in a commentary published with the study.\n\nWe asked Al-Aly, who was not involved in the trial, about the significance of the findings for COVID-19 treatment and the prevention of long COVID. His answers have been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nHealio: What stuck out to you in the results of the study?\n\nAl-Aly: I have been waiting for the results of this large, randomized study. It clearly shows that molnupiravir reduced the risk of several important outcomes. The effect size is small, but not negligible.\n\nHealio: What’s the bottom line on antivirals and long COVID?\n\nAl-Aly: As it stands, the current evidence suggests that antivirals have an effect in reducing the risk of long COVID. This is evident in PANORAMIC (molnupiravir) and a study on ensitrelvir, another antiviral from Japan. It is also clear from these studies that the effect size is small — meaning that we cannot solely rely on antivirals to completely prevent long COVID.\n\nHealio: What should clinicians take from these findings?\n\nAl-Aly: In high-risk individuals, antivirals reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 illness and may also reduce the risk of long COVID. They remain massively underutilized. Clinicians should be cognizant of adverse events, drug-drug interactions (for example, with Paxlovid), and the mutagenic potential of molnupiravir (it induces mutations in SARS-CoV-2). But they should also consider potential benefits.\n\nHealio: What do you hope they take away from your related commentary?\n\nAl-Aly: The PANORAMIC results suggest that blocking viral replication in the acute phase — via molnupiravir — reduced the risk of long Covid. This is an important clue — that hitting the virus early, diminishing its ability to replicate and suppressing viral load may hold promise in preventing long COVID. We need to continue to investigate the role of antivirals in preventing and treating long COVID and figure out ways to optimize their effectiveness. Trials to test combinations of antivirals, longer duration of treatment, etc., should be pursued.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Al-Aly Z.

In 2023, startups in the sector raised $2.2bn with 2024 looking similar — roughly half of the $4bn picked up in 2021, according to Sifted data.\n\nBut there have still been some sizable rounds in recent times. Since the start of 2023, surgical robotics startups have been the biggest winners. The UK’s CMR Surgical picked up £165m in September last year, Switzerland’s DistalMotion $150m in April 2023 and Italy’s Medical Microinstruments $110m in February this year.\n\nThere’s also been some buzz around next-gen diagnostic devices, as founders — including Spotify’s Daniel Ek with his body scanning startup Neko Health — look to tap into the trend of more people using wellbeing and fitness devices like Apple Watches and Oura rings.\n\nBut which non-portfolio medtech startups are investors keeping a close eye on? To find out, Sifted spoke to VCs at 415 Capital, Sofinnova Partners, MIG Capital and SHS Capital.\n\n### Linus Rieder, principal at 415 Capital\n\n#### Medical Microinstruments (MMI) – Italy\n\nMMI is building surgical robots to help with micro-surgery. Its robotics platform can be used in reconstructive surgery, plastic surgery and head-neck surgery. The startup is looking to solve key issues in microsurgery like the effects of surgeon tremor and reduces the need for microsurgery training.\n\n#### Gradient Denervation Technologies — France\n\nGradient Denervation Technologies is developing a device for treating heart failure patients with associated pulmonary hypertension. As many as half of heart failure patients around the world have elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, which is shown to lead to an increased risk of mortality and hospitalisation. There are no approved drug or device therapies for this group of pulmonary hypertension patients. By using minimally invasive ultrasound to treat hyperactive nerves in the pulmonary arteries, however, the startup’s technology has the potential to treat and help tens of thousands of patients each year.\n\n#### CorWave — France\n\nCorWave's left ventricular assist device (LVAD) mimics the natural heart's function to treat patients with advanced heart failure. This technology enables the device to replicate the heart pulses, reducing the mechanical damage to blood cells common with current LVADs.\n\n### Anne Osdoit, partner at Sofinnova Partners\n\n#### Ganymed Robotics — France\n\nGanymed is working on a robotics platform to assist surgeons with implant placement during knee replacement surgery. The Paris-based company's approach uses computer vision and artificial intelligence to perceive, and extract knowledge from, the surgical environment in a non-invasive manner, removing imaging and registration steps that add time and complexity to knee surgery.\n\n#### Gleamer — France\n\nGleamer is developing AI tools to enhance image interpretation for radiologists. The startup’s main product helps clinicians identify bone trauma at the point of care. Gleamer has achieved multiple regulatory approvals and successfully commercially deployed in both the US and EU.\n\n#### Salvia BioElectronics — The Netherlands\n\nSalvia BioElectronics is developing drug-free neuromodulation therapies — which refers to a group of medical procedures that look to change brain activity by stimulating nerves — for migraines. Salvia's paper-thin implant is designed to be placed under the forehead to reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks by delivering gentle electrical pulses to the nerves associated with the condition. The company is currently in the clinical stage, having received the Breakthrough Device Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which facilitates expedited market access for devices that treat life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating conditions.\n\n### Fei Tian, principal at MIG Capital\n\n#### Artidis — Switzerland\n\nArtidis is developing imaging tools for cancer diagnostics. It combines a nanotechnology device which analyses tissue with a digital data platform to measure the physical characteristics of both tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment. After determining if a tumour is benign or malignant, Artidis’ technology identifies if it will spread to other sites and can help inform chemotherapy and immunotherapy permeability and treatment response.\n\n#### CoreMedic — Switzerland\n\nCoreMedic has developed an implant which treats the heart condition mitral valve regurgitation (MR). The CoreMedic implant can replace ruptured mitral — a part of the heart — in a minimally invasive procedure that is physiological and reproducible, promising long-term clinical benefits.\n\n### Cornelius Maas, partner at SHS Capital\n\n#### Vitestro — The Netherlands\n\nVitestro is developing an autonomous blood drawing device. This innovative device combines robotics and AI to perform blood drawing more efficiently and safely. Over the past year, Vitestro has made significant strides in clinical trials and secured an additional €20m in funding in April. Vitestro’s tool could mean less burden for patients, less work for the medical staff and consequently reduce costs for the healthcare system.\n\n#### Saphenus — Austria\n\nSaphenus is developing sensory feedback systems for prosthetics. Their key product, the Suralis system, provides users of lower-limb prosthetics with the sensation of foot contact, significantly improving balance and gait. Recently, Saphenus received FDA approval with their Suralis systema and received reimbursement status with key German medical insurers.\n\n#### Bluedrop Medical — Ireland\n\nBluedrop Medical is developing a medical device to monitor foot health and prevent diabetic foot ulcers. It looks like a weighing scale and aims to enable early detection of foot ulcers, which can lead to amputation. Bluedrop Medical is a good example of how remote monitoring can replace doctor visits while preventing serious disease progression, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.", 'gpt-4o-mini']

Inflammation during the first gout flare is the most plausible explanation for this association," the authors wrote. "These findings support the need for cardiovascular risk management from the time of first gout consultation," they concluded.\n\nSOURCE:\n-------\n\nThe study was led by Edoardo Cipolletta, MD, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK, and Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy, and was published online in _Arthritis & Rheumatology_.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n------------\n\nLimitations included uncertainty about the time of onset of gout symptoms, failure to capture milder flares, possible unmeasured confounding, and lack of adjudication of cardiovascular events.\n\nDISCLOSURES:\n------------\n\nThe study was funded in part by the University of Nottingham.

Moreover, dietary fibre intake is associated with health benefits; however, intake is below UK recommendations (30 g/d). Utilising national dietary survey data can provide up-to-date information on a large representative cohort of UK older adults, so that tailored solutions can be developed in the future. This study used cross-sectional data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (years 2008–2009 to 2018–2019) for older adults’ (n 1863; 65–96 years) dietary fibre intake (three-to-four-day food diaries), top ten dietary fibre-rich foods, associated factors (demographics, dietary/lifestyle habits) and various health outcomes (anthropometric, blood and urine). Mean dietary fibre intake was 18·3 g/d (range: 2·9–55·1 g/d); therefore, below the UK dietary recommendations, with compliance at 5·7 %. In addition, there were five significant associations (P < 0·05) related to lower dietary fibre intake such as increasing age group, without own natural teeth, impaired chewing ability, lower education leaving age and poor general health. Older adults’ key foods containing dietary fibre were mainly based on convenience such as baked beans, bread and potatoes. Positively, higher dietary fibre consumption was significantly associated (P = 0·007) with reduced diastolic blood pressure. In summary, the benefits of dietary fibre consumption were identified in terms of health outcomes and oral health were key modulators of intake. Future work should focus on a life course approach and the role of food reformulation to help increase dietary fibre intake.\n\nThere are approximately 12 million older adults (aged 65 years and above) in the UK population, with one in ten at risk of malnutrition or considered malnourished; therefore, promoting healthy ageing could provide widespread benefits at both an individual and population level. Nutrition plays a key role in modulating health and well-being in the ageing population. More specifically, dietary fibre-rich diets are associated with lower risk from CVD, coronary events, stroke, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. Sufficient dietary fibre intake can also improve bowel function, quality of life and instrumental activities of daily living as well as having beneficial associations with certain aspects of cognitive function (such as digit symbol substitution test score) and skeletal muscle mass in older adults.\n\nThe dietary reference value for dietary fibre (quantitated by the Association of Analytical Chemists method) was increased to 30 g/d for UK adults (aged 19 years and over) in 2015. However, adherence to dietary fibre recommendations in the UK and globally is low. Therefore, it is important to put these values into context and understand how individuals can adhere to these 30 g/d recommendations. There are a number of strategies that will increase dietary fibre intake such as a consumption of a variety of fruits and vegetables, wholegrain cereals and high dietary fibre snacks (e.g. nuts and seeds) to comply with the recommendations. In the UK, dietary fibre intake in older adults is also well below the UK 30 g/d recommendations. Kehoe et al. reviewed older adults’ dietary fibre intake in eighteen countries from National Nutrition surveys and reported mean intakes of between 15–26 g/d, demonstrating that all countries surveyed were below the target from a UK guideline perspective. There is an urgent need to increase the dietary fibre intake in the population, particularly in older adults to promote public health.\n\nUnderstanding barriers to dietary fibre consumption in older populations is key to successful dietary modulation and behavioural change. Food accessibility, preparation and consumption challenges, coupled with health status, age-related changes, environment, social support, income and nutrition knowledge can contribute to insufficient dietary fibre intake in an ageing population. For example, oral health can be impacted by age often resulting in modulated food preferences favouring easy-to-chew foods; this may impact diet quality and variety as well as contribute to lower dietary fibre intake in an ageing population. Accordingly, food structure is a key consideration in ensuring age-appropriate foods. Unfortunately, dietary fibre-rich foods are often associated with negative textural attributes such as hard, fibrous, dry, sticky or adhesive, which are unlikely to improve or encourage consumption in an ageing population. In addition, there are various barriers associated with encouraging dietary fibre intake which need to be addressed including cost, low awareness of health benefits, confusion around intake requirements, inadequate food package labelling, limited product choice, unappealing sensory profile, difficulty in consumption, negative terms associated with high dietary fibre intake (e.g. stodgy and bloating) and cooking constraints. Going forward, overcoming such barriers will be key to promoting dietary fibre-rich diets.\n\nConsideration of compliance to dietary fibre requirements is often overshadowed by other nutrients such as sugar, saturated fat and salt, highlighting the need for greater awareness and research into promoting dietary fibre intake, especially in an ageing population. This paper aims to understand (1) what proportion of the ageing UK population meets dietary fibre intake recommendations; (2) what dietary fibre-rich foods are typically consumed by older adults; and (3) what factors are associated with consuming dietary fibre-rich foods in UK older adults, by using the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) (years 2008–2009 to 2018–2019) data, which includes a large representative cohort of UK older adults. These data will inform future strategies to enable an increase in dietary fibre intake within an older-aged population.\n\nMethods\n\nNational diet and nutrition survey\n\nThe NDNS is an ongoing national cross-sectional survey focusing on food consumption, nutrient intake and nutritional status in a representative UK population (aged 1·5 years and above) based on private households. In brief, invited individuals were selected at random (via the postcode address file) to ensure the data were a representative cohort of the UK population. The survey data collection centred around three aspects: (1) demographic and lifestyle questionnaires; (2) three-to-four-day unweighted food diary; and (3) obtaining physical measures of anthropometric outcomes, blood and urine samples. All individuals provided informed consent and it was ensured that data would be collected in accordance with relevant data protection legislation as well as confidentiality being maintained at all times. Ethical approval was granted from the corresponding ethical committees.\n\nStudy population\n\nAdults aged 65 years and over (commonly referred to as older adults in the UK and globally) were selected for analysis. Using years 2008–2009 to 2018–2019 from the NDNS resulted in a sample size of 1863 older adults (age range: 65–96 years; 42 % male and 58 % female).\n\nDietary, anthropometric and biochemical measures\n\nIn brief, individuals were suitably trained and asked to complete an unweighted three-to-four-day food diary to record all food and drink consumed (including time, company, eating location, food and drink description, brand names, portion sizes and dishes consumed at home and eating out). The data were subsequently coded and integrated into the Diet In Nutrients Out system, and analysis was based on the NDNS Nutrient Databank. The following measurements: height, weight, spot urine sample, blood pressure, non-fasting/fasting blood sample were also collected by a qualified nurse using validated approaches. For the purpose of this paper, the focus was on dietary fibre which was based on the Association of Analytical Chemists method. It should be noted some survey years have been retrospectively adjusted so that all data were reported using the Association of Analytical Chemists method.\n\nIn addition, factors that can modulate food intake such as demographic characteristics, lifestyle preferences and dietary habits were captured during the initial interview stage. Individuals’ height and weight were also recorded so that BMI was subsequently calculated. Potential factors that older adults may encounter in terms of consuming sufficient dietary fibre intake were explored: (1) household income (less than £5000 to more than £100\xa0000); (2) ethnicity (white, mixed ethnic group, black or black British, Asian or Asian British or any other group); (3) residence region (England: North, South, Central/Midlands, Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland); (4) survey year (2008–2009 to 2018–2019); (5) fruit and vegetable shopping frequency (more than once a day to less often than every two months); (6) fruit and vegetable shopping location (large supermarket to spontaneous); (7) food avoidance (yes vs. no); (8) overall health (very bad to very good); (9) medication use (yes vs. no); (10) own natural teeth (yes vs. no); (11) denture use (yes vs. no); (12) smoking (yes vs. no); (13) chewing ability (no difficulty to great amount of difficulty); (14) education leaving age (14 years or under to 19 years or over); (15) food type (soft/mashed foods to liquids); and (16) health outcomes (physical activity level, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TAG, total cholesterol and glucose) were all assessed and added as covariates in the analysis.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe statistical analysis was performed using Stata software (version 17·0, StataCorp LP, USA). The data were analysed as a survey; therefore, sampling weights (e.g. reduced sampling-related bias by taking into account the numbers of individuals within each strata) for each year of analysis (2008–2009 to 2018–2019) were applied. The individual-level sampling weights (as recommended by NDNS) were applied for the analysis on the association of dietary fibre consumption with demographic characteristics and types of foods consumed as well as the association of dietary fibre intake with anthropometric measures and health outcomes. The data are presented as means with se. It should be noted that for some variables (such as physical activity, BMI, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and blood analytes), data were not available for all 1863 older adults. Accordingly, this was adjusted in the analysis (by removing the observations with missing values) using the ‘SVY command’ in Stata. In addition, linear regression was used to assess the association of dietary fibre consumption with demographic characteristics and health outcomes. More specifically, the analysis was conducted using three models: (1) model one compared the outcomes of interest (fruit and vegetable shopping frequency and location, food avoidance, overall health, medication use, own natural teeth, denture use, chewing ability, education leaving age and food type) with dietary fibre and analysis was controlled for energy (bivariate analysis); (2) model two compared outcomes of interest in model one with age and sex added as covariates (multivariate analysis); and (3) model three was an analysis of model two with additional covariates (household income, residence region, survey year and ethnicity) (multivariate analysis). The health outcomes of interest (physical activity, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TAG, total cholesterol and glucose) utilised the same three models described above in our regression analysis. For all analyses P < 0·05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nThe majority of the older adult cohort were aged between 65–74 years (57·1 %), resident in England (59·4 %), white British (97·4 %) and typically shopping for fruit/vegetables at large supermarkets (76·9 %) (Table S1). Older adults’ mean consumption of dietary fibre was 18·3 g/d (range: 2·9–55·1 g/d); only 5·7 % of this population (n 107/1863) adhered to the current UK recommendations utilising average dietary fibre intake over a three-to-four-day period. There was a significant association (P = 0·02) for age group, with increasing age resulting in lower dietary fibre consumption (multivariate: –0·78 ± 0·33). The extent of sex-related associations was also modulated by analysis. Males consumed significantly more dietary fibre than females in the bivariate analysis (P = 0·01); however, this significant association was reduced in the multivariate analysis.\n\nThere was a significant association (P < 0·0001) with dentition, where older adults with their own natural teeth consumed more dietary fibre than individuals without their own natural teeth. Similarly, older adults that reported impaired chewing ability had significantly lower dietary fibre intake (P = 0·003) compared with individuals with no chewing difficulty. There was also a tendency for an association (P = 0·08) with denture use, with those who used dentures consuming less dietary fibre compared with non-denture users. The education leaving age had a significant impact on dietary fibre intake (P < 0·0001) where finishing school at a higher age was associated with increased dietary fibre intake. General health status was significantly associated (P = 0·001) with dietary fibre consumption where older adults that reported poorer general health had significantly lower dietary fibre intake. The remaining factors (such as household income, medication, smoking, fruit/vegetable shopping frequency and food avoidance) had no significant association with dietary fibre intake. However, it should be noted that all factors (apart from fruit and vegetable shopping location; P = 0·30) resulted in a significant association in the bivariate analysis; hence, included in subsequent multivariate analysis.\n\nOlder adults consumed the largest quantity of dietary fibre from baked beans, regardless of age and sex. Overall, bread and potatoes were the most frequently consumed dietary fibre-rich foods within this population. In addition, mean fruit and vegetable consumption was 121·1 g/d (range: 0·0–738·3 g/d) and just 24 % of older adults (n 448/1863) met the five-a-day recommendations.\n\nBMI was significantly associated with dietary fibre intake (bivariate: 0·04 ± 0·01; P = 0·003) where an increase in BMI resulted in higher dietary fibre consumption; however, this association was reduced in the multivariate analysis (multivariate: 0·003 ± 0·03; P = 0·19). This was also the case for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (bivariate: 1·05 ± 0·43; P = 0·02 vs. multivariate: 0·74 ± 0·74; P = 0·32). Similarly, higher dietary fibre intake was significantly associated (bivariate: –0·69 ± 0·36; P = 0·05) with lower TAG; yet this effect was lost after multivariate analysis (model three: −0·89 ± 0·63; P = 0·16). It should be noted that only diastolic blood pressure was significantly associated (P = 0·007) with dietary fibre intake in all analyses; higher dietary fibre intake was associated with a lower diastolic blood pressure (–0·08 ± 0·03). Due to the lack of significant association between physical activity level, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol and glucose in the bivariate analysis, these outcomes were not included in subsequent analysis.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe mean dietary fibre intake of UK older adults was 18·3 g/d (range: 2·9–55·1 g/d) which was only 61 % of the current UK dietary reference value. This finding was not unexpected since data from eighteen European countries National Nutrition surveys also identified older adults’ dietary fibre intake was typically below target (15–26 g/d). However, Kehoe et al. did not split older adults by increasing age groups; accordingly, age-related differences in intake within an ageing population may have been overlooked. Therefore, to address such a limitation our analyses grouped older adults into three groups: (1) young-old (aged 65–74 years); (2) old-old (aged 75–84 years); and (3) oldest-old (aged 85+ years). It was evident that our older adult cohort (75+ years) consumed less dietary fibre than their younger counterparts (65–74 years); this suggests the importance of recruiting sufficient older adults across the different age groups especially as the impact of age-related changes are likely to be greater with increasing age. Moreover, it is important to understand adherence to guidelines within the population; our analysis demonstrated that only 107 from 1863 older adults adhered to current guidelines (using average dietary fibre intake over three-to-four-day period). However, it should be noted this is similar in the general adult population (19–64 years) for dietary fibre. For example, Scheelbeek et al. noted approximately 7 % of the UK population met dietary fibre-related guidelines (Eatwell Guide). In addition, modelling related studies have demonstrated a small increase in dietary fibre intake (2·2 g/d) due to dietary fibre enrichment which could have widespread public implications. Additionally, it is useful to investigate the role of various demographics on subsequent dietary fibre intake. Overall, basic demographics (such as household income, residence region, ethnicity and survey year) had no significant impact on dietary fibre consumption in this older adult cohort. Furthermore, a recent review highlighted the impact of diversity (e.g. background and health conditions) within this age group; this could be a possible reason for inconsistency in reporting associations between such demographics compared with other age groups as well as methodology differences in grouping individuals. However, it should be noted that education leaving age had a noteworthy effect on dietary fibre. For example, higher education achievement resulted in higher dietary fibre intake; similar findings have been present in the literature where lower education led to lower dietary fibre intake and diet quality. Therefore, this suggests more emphasis on a life course approach to dietary fibre and the role of food reformulation to help increase dietary fibre intake.\n\nIt is important to understand the relevant challenges associated with older adults’ dietary fibre intake so that targeted strategies to promote intake can be subsequently identified. For example, oral health can decline with age (such as teeth loss, chewing problems and lower bite force); thereby, negatively impacting dietary fibre intake (e.g. modulating food preferences and cooking preparation) within an ageing population. Such findings were evident in our older adult cohort where individuals with poor chewing ability and without their own natural teeth tended to consume less dietary fibre. This suggests older adults with oral health impairments food preferences and diet quality are also influenced implying tailored advice with relevant substitutions would be helpful for this population. Therefore, developing targeted strategies to meet older adults’ needs (including understanding relevant changes in oral processing behaviours with increasing age) would be suggested to overcome associated barriers and subsequently help reduce the widespread deficit in dietary fibre intake.\n\nThe top ten foods that contributed to older adults’ dietary fibre were compiled so that trends could be identified and areas of focus highlighted. The key dietary fibre-rich foods in terms of largest amount of dietary fibre and most commonly consumed were baked beans, bread and potatoes; suggesting convenience and foods requiring minimal effort was a key driver of food choice in this population. It is likely age-related changes could be a contributing factor resulting in preference for simple, easy/quick to prepare and convenience foods. Moreover, Nakano and Washizu noted the shift in perceptions of convenience foods, and this could have a role in supporting healthy eating in an ageing population. In addition, convenience and easy access to food are considered to promote food intake and a key motivator in food choice; accordingly, this emphasises the importance of positive environmental cues on subsequent intake. Going forward, improving fruit and vegetable consumption in this population would be recommended; in addition, this should have a noteworthy impact on dietary fibre consumption. However, it is not without its challenges such as concerns over food wastage (e.g. vegetable packet size too large in some cases), requiring regular shopping, cost implications, cooking skills and living alone. Accordingly, this indicates the importance of making dietary fibre-rich foods accessible to all to reduce consumption-related barriers.\n\nThe health benefits of dietary fibre consumption are well-recognised such as reduction in CVD, coronary events, stroke, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer risk. However, it is important to put such findings into context by investigating various health outcomes within our older adult cohort. General health (via self-reported measures) was related with higher dietary fibre intake as such highlighting that individuals identifying as healthier consumed more dietary fibre and clearly demonstrating the benefits of dietary fibre consumption. Moreover, it is important to understand whether perceived health can be explained by differences in relevant health markers. Most anthropometric and biochemical measures including BMI, physical activity level, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, TAG and glucose were not significantly associated with dietary fibre intake. However, there was a beneficial association between diastolic blood pressure and dietary fibre intake, where higher dietary fibre intake was associated with a lower diastolic blood pressure. If an older adult meets the dietary fibre 30 g/d recommendations, this was associated with a 2·5 mmHg lower diastolic blood pressure, which was clinically significant on a population scale. Cook et al. noted that a 2·0 mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure could decrease hypertension prevalence as well as CHD and stroke risk. Therefore, developing easy to implement and accessible dietary fibre-related strategies for all is a key going forward.\n\nThe strength of the analysis is that the NDNS data include a representative cohort of UK older adults. However, it should be noted that such analysis is associated with various methodology challenges and potential limitations: (1) NDNS is a cross-sectional survey and identifies associations rather than causation and (2) potential bias may be linked with self-reported dietary intakes and potential underreporting. In addition, the older adult cohort was mainly between 65–74 years old and 65 % of the cohort rated their general health either as good or very good. Therefore, going forward capturing adults in the oldest age group (85+ years) and more valuable health categories as well as underrepresented ethnic groups could provide additional age-related insights as dietary fibre intake may differ in such groups.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis cross-sectional analysis observed that older adults’ dietary fibre intake was substantially below UK recommendations. Five key contributing factors (increasing age group, without own natural teeth, impaired chewing ability, lower education leaving age and poor general health) had a notable impact on subsequent dietary fibre intake. In addition, the role of easy-to-eat foods in older adults’ food choice should not be underestimated as baked beans, bread and potatoes were identified as key foods containing dietary fibre. Accordingly, promoting fruit and vegetables could lead to an uplift in dietary fibre consumption; however, any suggested foods also need to be tailored to the needs of this population (such as oral health impairments). Moreover, the beneficial association between health and dietary fibre (such as reduction in diastolic blood pressure and self-reported good general health) is noteworthy. This highlights the importance of increasing dietary fibre prior to entering the ‘older adults’ stage should be a key public health priority.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe research project ‘Fibre4life: exploring, engaging and educating older adults on dietary fibre’ was funded by a UKRI BBSRC/MRC Food4years Ageing Network Pump Priming Award.\n\nConceptualisation: V.
