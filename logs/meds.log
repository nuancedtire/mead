The doctor, wearing a white coat and stethoscope, is pointing to a digital tablet displaying a graph illustrating cardiovascular risks associated with gout. The patient, a middle-aged male with a concerned expression, is seated across from her, looking intently at the screen. 

The clinic is bright and well-lit, with medical posters on the walls about gout and cardiovascular health. A window in the background allows natural light to flood the room, creating a warm yet urgent atmosphere. Use a shallow depth of field to focus on the interaction between the doctor and patient, while softly blurring the background elements. The color palette should include calming blues and whites, emphasizing a professional and reassuring environment. Capture the mood of urgency and importance in addressing cardiovascular health in patients with gout."

Don't overlook the cardiovascular risks! \n\nRecent research highlights a concerning trend: \n- Patients face a 3.9% risk of cardiovascular events within 2 years of a gout diagnosis. \n- The risk is particularly pronounced in the first month, with 31.2 events per 1000 person-years compared to 21.6 events in the following months. \n- Women experience a greater elevation in risk compared to men. \n- Early intervention with colchicine on the day of diagnosis can significantly reduce this risk (adjusted incidence rate ratio of 0.84). \n\nThese findings underscore the importance of proactive cardiovascular risk management right from the first gout consultation. \n\nHow are you addressing cardiovascular health in your patients with newly diagnosed gout?", ['Healthcare & Policy', 'Gout', 'CardiovascularHealth', 'Inflammation', 'HealthcareProfessionals'], 'https://fal.media/files/monkey/-F3INC-OTrgJsSesvz35S.png', 'http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/cardiovascular-risk-merits-attention-newly-diagnosed-gout-2024a1000gvv', 'You are a content strategist specializing in crafting engaging and informative social media posts for healthcare professionals based on detailed medical articles or web content. Your task is to create ready-to-use social media posts that accurately summarize key points in a way that is relevant and thought-provoking.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n - Engaging Openers: Start with a creative hook that grabs attention—use clinical scenarios, surprising statistics, or thought-provoking questions (without relying on overused phrases like “Did you know?”).\n - Informative Content: Provide a concise yet comprehensive summary of the most important information, ensuring clarity and relevance to healthcare professionals.\n - Balanced Tone: Maintain a professional yet approachable tone. Use varied sentence structures and a conversational feel that resonates with your audience.\n - Highlight Key Findings: Use bullet points to present important statistics or findings, making the information easy to read and digest.\n - Foster Engagement: Conclude with a thoughtful question or statement that encourages reflection or invites interaction, ensuring it feels natural and appropriate.\n - Emojis Usage: Use emojis sparingly and strategically to emphasize key points or statistics, while maintaining professionalism.\n - Formatting: Deliver the final post as plain text, formatted for easy reading without the need for Markdown or HTML.\n\nKey Focus:\n\n - Clarity and Comprehensiveness: Ensure the post covers essential details to inform healthcare professionals effectively.\n - Readability: Use bullet points and varied sentence lengths to enhance readability.\n\nAn Example Post:\n\n⏱️ A weekly insulin dose that matches daily treatments in efficacy—could this reshape type 2 diabetes care?\n\nIn the QWINT-2 phase 3 trial, once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa demonstrated:\n\n - A1C reduction of 1.34% vs. 1.26% with daily insulin degludec, resulting in A1C levels of 6.87% and 6.95% respectively at 52 weeks.\n - 45 minutes more time in range per day without increased hypoglycemia risk.\n - A safety profile similar to daily insulins, with no severe hypoglycemic events reported for efsitora.\n\nCould once-weekly dosing improve adherence and reduce treatment burden for your patients?', 'Cardiovascular Risk Merits Attention in Newly Diagnosed Gout\n===============\n\nThis site is intended for UK healthcare professionals\n\nTOPLINE:\xa0\n---------\n\nPatients have an increased risk for cardiovascular events in the first month after a gout diagnosis that appears related to inflammation.\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n------------\n\n*   Investigators analysed data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Database-GOLD and linked databases.\n*   They conducted a cohort study among 76,440 patients with newly diagnosed gout and a self-controlled case series study among 4398 patients who had a cardiovascular event in the 2 years before or after gout diagnosis.\n*   The main outcome was a first cardiovascular event (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischaemic attack).\n\nTAKEAWAY:\n---------\n\n*   In the cohort study, 3.9% of patients experienced a cardiovascular event in the 2 years after gout diagnosis.\n*   The incidence of events was higher during days 1-30 postdiagnosis vs days 31-730 postdiagnosis (31.2 vs 21.6 events/1000 person-years).\n*   In the self-controlled case series, the incidence was higher in the 30 days after gout diagnosis compared with the patient\'s own baseline period (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.55) and especially in the first 15 days (1.70).\n*   Findings were similar regardless of age, comorbidities, and diuretic use, but the elevation of risk was greater for women than for men.\n*   The association was largely attenuated when colchicine was prescribed the day of gout diagnosis (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.84) and somewhat attenuated when non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed that day (1.39).\n\nIN PRACTICE:\n------------\n\n"First gout diagnosis was associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events in the short term. Inflammation during the first gout flare is the most plausible explanation for this association," the authors wrote. "These findings support the need for cardiovascular risk management from the time of first gout consultation," they concluded.\n\nSOURCE:\n-------\n\nThe study was led by Edoardo Cipolletta, MD, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK, and Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy, and was published online in _Arthritis & Rheumatology_.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n------------\n\nLimitations included uncertainty about the time of onset of gout symptoms, failure to capture milder flares, possible unmeasured confounding, and lack of adjudication of cardiovascular events.\n\nDISCLOSURES:\n------------\n\nThe study was funded in part by the University of Nottingham.

Here’s what we learned:\n\n- GLYCOSYLATION PATTERNS MATTER: Increased fucosylation and sialylation of serum proteins correlate with poorer outcomes for patients treated with nivolumab (Opdivo) plus cabozantinib (Cabometyx) compared to sunitinib (Sutent).\n- POTENTIAL PREDICTIVE BIOMARKERS: High serum levels of CO3 glycopeptide may indicate a favorable response to the nivolumab-cabozantinib combination, while low levels of CFAH glycopeptide suggest a similar trend.\n- CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study emphasizes the need for effective biomarkers to identify which patients will benefit most from anti–PD-1 therapies, as current genomic approaches may not capture the full picture.\n- LONG-TERM EFFICACY: The combination therapy continues to show significant improvements in progression-free survival (16.4 months vs. 8.4 months) and overall survival (46.5 months vs. 36.0 months) compared to sunitinib.\n\nAs we delve deeper into the complexities of protein glycosylation, could these findings pave the way for personalized treatment strategies in RCC? \n\n#KidneyCancer #Oncology #Biomarkers #ClinicalResearch', ['Research & Clinical Trials', 'KidneyCancer', 'Oncology', 'Biomarkers', 'ClinicalResearch'], 'https://fal.media/files/lion/2IlmHv7U3lDJrD8r4tlLn.png', 'https://www.targetedonc.com/view/first-line-treatment-for-kidney-cancer-new-data-strengthens-combo-approach', 'You are a content strategist specializing in crafting engaging and informative social media posts for healthcare professionals based on detailed medical articles or web content.

Braun, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine (Medical Oncology) and Louis Goodman and Alfred Gilman Yale Scholar at Yale School of Medicine, in New Haven, Connecticut. Specifically, high serum levels of CO3 glycopeptide are potentially predictive of favorable response to the nivolumab plus cabozantinib vs sunitinib, as are low serum levels of CFAH glycopeptide.\n\n“We see that higher amounts of protein glycosylation, both sialylation and fucosylation, appear to be prognostic in this data set, and that specific protein glycosylation events related to lipid metabolism, but also related to the complement cascade, have the potential to [possibly] be predictive of response in anti–PD-1-based therapy, as opposed to sunitinib,” Braun said in a presentation of the data. “But I want to highlight this is really early exploratory work. I [believe] the main question is, is this an area for further investigation in biomarker development in RCC? And I [believe] the answer to that is, yes.”\n\nCheckMate-9ER enrolled patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with a clear cell component. They could have disease of any risk by International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria, but they needed to have tumor tissue available for analysis.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 240 mg of intravenous (IV) nivolumab every 2 weeks paired with 40 mg of oral cabozantinib once daily vs 50 mg of oral sunitinib on a cycle of 4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off. Treatment continued until disease progression by RECIST v1.1 criteria or intolerable toxicity. Stratification factors included IMDC risk score, tumor PD-L1 expression, and geographic region.\n\nThe primary end point of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review committee (BICR) and RECIST 1.1 criteria. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) by BICR and RECIST 1.1 criteria, as well as safety. Health-related quality of life served as an important exploratory end point.\n\nIn January 2021, the FDA approved nivolumab plus cabozantinib for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC based on earlier data from CheckMate-9ER. Data from the 55-month follow-up of the study shared during the 2024 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium showed that nivolumab plus cabozantinib continues to provide a meaningful improvement over sunitinib in PFS, OS, and ORR. In the intention-to-treat population, the PFS by BICR was 16.4 months (95% CI, 12.5-19.3) with the doublet vs 8.4 months (95% CI, 7.0-9.7) with sunitinib (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49-0.70). The median OS with nivolumab plus cabozantinib was 46.5 months (95% CI, 40.6-53.4) vs 36.0 months (95% CI, 29.2-42.8) with sunitinib (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95). The ORR by BICR was 55.7% with the doublet vs 27.7% with sunitinib.\n\n“[Although] anti–PD-1–based therapy is really the standard for first-line RCC, we still lack effective biomarkers to figure out which patients are likely to respond, and which tumors are likely to be resistant to therapy. Our group, and many others, have focused largely on the genomics and transcriptomics of the tumor itself, but we know that posttranslational modifications of proteins themselves play an important role in those proteins’ function,” Braun said. “In fact, glycosylation of protein, altered glycosylation, is a hallmark of cancer and involved in many malignant processes. Hypersialylation in particular, engages sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin receptors and is known to be immunomodulatory, potentially raising the idea that it could contribute to anti–PD-1 resistance.”\n\nFor the post hoc analysis, Braun and colleagues evaluated the link between site-specific glycopeptide modifications with nivolumab plus cabozantinib/sunitinib response in patients with advanced RCC by leveraging pre-treatment serum samples. They used the InterVenn GlycoVision platform to conduct a glycoproteomic analysis, to understand if altered protein glycosylation is a possible avenue for biomarker studies in RCC. They identified 24 serum glycopeptides that were linked with PFS or OS with the doublet.\n\n“The first question is, how are these regulated? Are they regulated in a coordinated fashion or not? We looked across patients for site-specific protein glycosylation, [and what] we can see is highly coordinated modules of altered protein glycosylation, [with] red piercing correlations across patients for these different site-specific glycosylations,” Braun said. “Now, in our initial study and our initial look at these particular proteins, we can see that these coordinated modules seem to be associated with altered PFS and OS with nivolumab plus cabozantinib, either positively or negatively. So, this gave us some initial insight for further study, that these are highly coordinated and potentially associated with clinical outcome.”\n\nBraun added that the next question posed by the investigators was whether the total amount of glycosylation is important and if it plays a role in clinical outcomes. To that end, they examined the total amount of 2 forms of glycosylation: sialyation and fucosylation.\n\n“We see basically an increasing amount of glycosylation, the number of amino acid residues that have a sialic acid or a fucose residue. As we can see, for both nivolumab [plus] cabozantinib and sunitinib, when you have more glycosylation, you have a higher hazard ratio, [which is] essentially worse PFS and OS with more protein glycosylation,” Braun explained. “This at least raises the potential that this could be prognostic and really reinforces prior studies seen in melanoma. So that’s a potential prognostic role.”\n\nThey then set out to evaluate whether this marker could be predictive for response to the doublet vs the monotherapy. When they look across several protein glycosylations, 2 patterns emerged, Braun noted. “One, proteins involved in lipid metabolism, and the second were members of the complement cascade,” he said. “One is CO3. And what we can see is that at low levels of protein glycosylation, there’s [essentially] no difference between nivolumab plus cabozantinib or sunitinib with respect to PFS, but at high levels of protein glycosylation, this is where we see tremendous benefit from nivolumab plus cabozantinib. This is hypothesis generating. This is a proinflammatory complement protein, so could this be mediating complement-induced antitumor activity?”\n\nThe opposite pattern was observed for CFAH glycopeptide. He noted that high levels of the checkpoint did not show benefit from the doublet whereas when the protein glycosylation was low, substantial benefit was observed with the combination. “The hypothesis is that this negative regulator of alternate complement activity, when it’s low, that’s when the immune therapy is able to act,” Braun said.\n\nHe concluded that the prognostic or predictive potential of glycopeptide biomarkers should be further examined in additional clinical trials.\n\n_Disclosures: Dr Braun shared that he has a non-CE consulting relationship with Cancer Expert Now, Adnovate Strategies, MDedge, CancerNetwork, Catenion, OncLive, Cello Health BioConsulting, PWW Consulting, Haymarket Medical Network, Aptitude Health, ASCO Post/Harborside, Targeted Oncology, Merck, Pfizer, MedScape, Accolade 2nd MD, DLA Piper, AbbVie, Compugen, Link Cell Therapies, Scholar Rock, and NeoMorph.

Higher levels of leptin, a hormone that helps maintain normal body weight, is associated with better signal-transmitting brain white matter in middle-aged adults, according to a study by The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio).\n\n"The findings support the known role of leptin variations in late-life dementia risk by relating its deficiency with changes in white matter structure, which is an early event in the process of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer\'s disease or vascular dementia," said Claudia Satizabal, Ph.D., associate professor at the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer\'s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio.\n\nSatizabal is lead author of a study titled "Leptin bioavailability and markers of brain atrophy and vascular injury in the middle age," published Aug. 12 in Alzheimer\'s & Dementia. Other authors also are with the Biggs Institute, as well as Tufts Medical Center in Boston; the Framingham Heart Study; Boston University School of Public Health; University of California-Davis; National and Kapodistrian University of Athens; and Columbia University.\n\nObesity and Alzheimer\'s\n-----------------------\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease is the leading cause of dementia, impacting the lives of millions of people worldwide, the study notes. Increasing evidence suggests that midlife obesity is an important contributor to the risk of developing the disease.\n\nThis has led to a growing interest in untangling the mechanisms linking obesity to Alzheimer\'s, which potentially extend through vascular, genetic and metabolic pathways. The study of adipose or fatty tissue has led to significant insights.\n\nOnce viewed as a passive reservoir for energy storage, adipose tissue is now considered a part of the endocrine system, secreting a group of bioactive peptides known as adipokines, or cell-signaling molecules that play functional roles in the energy or metabolic status of the body, inflammation and obesity.\n\nLeptin is an adipokine responsible for central control of food intake and energy homeostasis, and has been implicated in a variety of neurophysiological functions, including brain development, neurogenesis and neuroprotection.\n\nBecause of these effects, it has been considered a plausible mechanism in the pathway leading from obesity to Alzheimer\'s disease. It is supported by findings tying higher leptin levels to lower risk for incident Alzheimer\'s disease and mild cognitive impairment, as well as better structural brain indicators in older adults, the study notes.\n\nStill, studies conducted in younger individuals have not detected associations between leptin and early indicators of brain damage preceding late-life dementia risk. Researchers in the new study at UT Health San Antonio aimed to gain further insights into the potential relationships of leptin with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular burden.\n\nSpecifically, they investigated the associations of leptin markers with cognitive function and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of brain atrophy and vascular injury in healthy middle-aged adults.\n\nThey conducted neuropsychological evaluations of 2,262 cognitively healthy participants from the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term cardiovascular cohort study of residents from Framingham, Massachusetts, spanning three generations and now a project of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, in collaboration with Boston University.\n\nThe scientists measured concentrations of leptin, its soluble leptin receptor and their ratio, known as the free leptin index, indicating leptin bioavailability, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Cognitive and MRI measures were derived using standardized protocols.\n\nThe results found a higher association of the soluble leptin receptor with lower fractional anisotropy, a biomarker of brain white-matter integrity, and peak-width skeletonized mean diffusivity, an imaging marker for white-matter injury. Correspondingly, a higher free leptin index was associated with higher fractional anisotropy.\n\nThese results were replicated in a study that included 89 cognitively healthy Hispanic participants from San Antonio, by MarkVCID, a consortium of U.S. academic medical centers whose mission is to identify and validate biomarkers for the small vessel diseases of the brain that produce vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).\n\nTaken together, the researchers concluded that higher leptin bioavailability was associated with better white-matter integrity in healthy middle-aged adults, supporting the putative neuroprotective role of leptin in late-life dementia risk.\n\nMore information: Sokratis Charisis et al, Leptin bioavailability and markers of brain atrophy and vascular injury in the middle age, Alzheimer\'s & Dementia (2024).

The FDA granted F2G a breakthrough designation for olorofim in 2019.\n\nSince the first filing, F2G has completed a phase 2b study in patients with invasive aspergillosis, scedosporiosis, lomentosporiosis, fusariosis, scopulariopsis, and coccidioidomycosis infections and limited treatment options – which was ongoing when the FDA turned down the application in June 2023.\n\nIt has also started a 225-subject phase 3 trial called OASIS, comparing treatment with olorofim to Astellas\' AmBisome (liposomal amphotericin B) in invasive aspergillosis, which should generate results next year.\n\nInvasive aspergillosis is a serious infection that typically affects people with compromised immune systems and there are rising rates of resistance to azoles and amphotericin B, the two most effective classes of treatment.\n\nThe new financing was led by the AMR Action Fund, said to be the world\'s largest public-private partnership investing in the development of new antimicrobial therapeutics, and backed up by existing investors Novo Holdings, Advent Life Sciences, Sofinnova Partners, Forbion, Blue Owl Healthcare Opportunities, Morningside Ventures, Brace Pharmaceuticals, and Merifin Capital.\n\n"For decades, clinicians have relied on a handful of antifungal classes, with few mechanisms of action and significant limitations due to spectrum of activity, drug toxicities, or drug-drug interactions," said AMR Action Fund\'s chief executive Henry Skinner, who has joined the board of F2G.\n\n"These therapies are increasingly failing in patients," he added. "We are thrilled to support F2G\'s team as they develop this urgently needed therapy and seek regulatory approval."\n\nOlorofim is licensed in Europe and Asia to Japanese pharma Shionogi, which paid $100 million upfront for rights to the drug in 2022, with F2G retaining rights in North America. F2G\'s last fundraising was in a $70 million round led by Forbion and Sofinnova two years ago.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

At the European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meeting, University of Colorado researchers presented more data from their institution of adults with type 1 diabetes who used tirzepatide as well as semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy, Novo Nordisk) off-label.\n\nData were derived from Snell-Bergeon J, et al. OP 43. Presented at: European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting; Sept. 9-13, 2024; Madrid.\n\n“Off-label semaglutide and tirzepatide treatment resulted in significant weight loss and improved glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes, with no reported hospitalization for hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis,” Janet Snell-Bergeon, PhD, professor of pediatrics at the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said during the presentation.\n\nResearchers conducted a retrospective chart review of 50 adults with type 1 diabetes and overweight or obesity who used semaglutide off-label and 50 adults who used tirzepatide off-label. Propensity score matching was used to compare data from semaglutide and tirzepatide users with 50 controls with type 1 diabetes and overweight or obesity who were not treated with either medication. Changes in BMI, body weight and HbA1c were assessed over a 1-year period.\n\nReductions in weight, HbA1c\n\nAdults using tirzepatide had a 7.5 kg/m2 decline in BMI and semaglutide users a 3 kg/m2 decrease in BMI from baseline to 12 months (P for treatment difference < .0001). The tirzepatide group had a significantly greater reduction in BMI than controls starting at 3 months and continuing until the end of the study, whereas semaglutide users had a significantly greater decrease in BMI than controls beginning at 6 months and continuing through 1 year.\n\nThe tirzepatide group lost 21.4% of their body weight from baseline to 1 year and the semaglutide group achieved a 9.1% weight reduction in that same period (P for treatment difference < .0001). A weight loss of 10% or more at 1 year was achieved by 87% of adults using tirzepatide and 47% of those using semaglutide compared with no participants in the control group (P < .001).\n\nAdults using semaglutide had a 0.54 percentage point decline in HbA1c at 1 year compared with a 0.68 percentage point decrease for those using tirzepatide. Both decreases were greater than the change in the placebo group (P = .008).\n\nChange in total, basal and bolus insulin daily dose was significantly lower for adults using tirzepatide than those using semaglutide or controls. At 1 year, there was no significant difference in the change in total, basal or bolus insulin dose between the semaglutide and control groups.\n\n“When we looked at total insulin dose per kilogram of body weight, there was a significant decrease [with tirzepatide], indicating that this went beyond just the loss of body weight and perhaps improved insulin sensitivity,” Snell-Bergeon said.\n\nThe change in BMI, body weight and HbA1c did not differ between adults receiving multiple daily insulin injections and those using an insulin pump. Snell-Bergeon said there was a trend toward greater HbA1c loss for adults receiving tirzepatide and using an insulin pump vs. semaglutide users or those using tirzepatide with multiple daily injections.\n\nDosing and safety\n\nPeople using semaglutide began at a starting dose of 0.25 mg per week and were titrated up based on clinical guidelines. Of the group, 38 reached a maximum dose of 0.5 mg per week. For those using tirzepatide, the starting dose was 2.5 mg per week. Of the tirzepatide group, 16 reached a maximum dose of 5 mg, eight reached a maximum dose of 7.5 mg and 14 reached a maximum dose of 10 mg.\n\nThere were no reports of hospitalizations for DKA or hypoglycemia during the study. Three adults using semaglutide and one using tirzepatide discontinued the medication due to lack of response.\n\nSnell-Bergeon said randomized controlled trials still need to be conducted to assess efficacy and safety outcomes for both medications among adults with type 1 diabetes.\n\nPublished by: \n\nSources/DisclosuresCollapse\n\nSource:\n\nSnell-Bergeon J, et al.

This approval is supported by findings from the 2/3 KEYNOTE-483 trial (NCT02784171). Here, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the firstline led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) vs chemotherapy alone.\n\nThe FDA has granted approval to the first-line treatment of pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\nData from the randomized, open-label, phase 2/3 KEYNOTE-483 trial (NCT02784171) support this approval. According to findings presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, the combination of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy led to a statistically significant improvement in OS, reducing the risk of death by 21% (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.98; 2-sided P =.0324). The median OS with the combination was 17.3 months (95% CI, 14.4-21.3) vs 16.1 months (95% CI, 13.1-18.2) with chemotherapy alone.\n\nA significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) was also observed with the combination. The PFS was 7.13 months (HR, 0.80; 95%CI, 0.65-0.99; 2-sided P =.0372) with the combination vs 7.16 months with chemotherapy, and at 12 months, the estimated PFS rates across arms were 26% and 17%, respectively. The overall response rate (ORR) was also significantly higher for the pembrolizumab combination at 62% vs 38% with chemotherapy alone (P <.0001).\n\nFor safety, the safety profile of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in this study was consistent with what has been previously reported.\n\nThose with measurable disease; an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; and adequate hematologic, liver, and renal function and those who had no contraindications to standard chemotherapy were eligible for enrollment in the study. Patients must have also been eligible to receive standard chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin and must have been incurable with use of standard therapies to be included in the study. Patients were permitted to have had prior radiation at least 28 days prior to registration; however, radiation to the thorax was not allowed unless clear disease progression was seen. Further, patients were permitted to have undergone previous major surgery at least 28 days prior to registration.\n\nThere were 440 patients enrolled during the phase 3 portion and randomized to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab given intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles in combination with 500 mg/m2 of pemetrexed every 3 weeks for 6 cycles and 75 mg/m2 of cisplatin every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Patients also could have been given pemetrexed plus cisplatin alone. Cisplatin could be substituted with carboplatin at an area under the curve of 5 or 6 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles in either arm.\n\nREFERENCES:  \n1.

Participants were aged at least 50 years or at least 18 years with a comorbidity, and 99.1% had received a previous dose of COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe researchers found that vaccinated participants treated with the antiviral experienced fewer and less severe COVID-19 symptoms, accessed health care less often and took less time off work 6 months after recovery, “but with small effect sizes” and “high numbers needed to treat.”\n\nSpecifically, among participants in the treatment arm, molnupiravir was associated with a 1.9% reduction in severity of any severe symptoms and a 2.5% reduction in severity of persistent symptoms after 6 months. The number of participants needed to treat to achieve the benefit were 52.6 and 40, respectively.\n\n“The promising results from the PANORAMIC trial are consistent with results from well-conducted observational analyses as they both converge on finding a modest effect of molnupiravir in reducing the risk of long COVID in high-risk individuals,” Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development services at Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System, wrote in a commentary published with the study.\n\nWe asked Al-Aly, who was not involved in the trial, about the significance of the findings for COVID-19 treatment and the prevention of long COVID. His answers have been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nHealio: What stuck out to you in the results of the study?\n\nAl-Aly: I have been waiting for the results of this large, randomized study. It clearly shows that molnupiravir reduced the risk of several important outcomes. The effect size is small, but not negligible.\n\nHealio: What’s the bottom line on antivirals and long COVID?\n\nAl-Aly: As it stands, the current evidence suggests that antivirals have an effect in reducing the risk of long COVID. This is evident in PANORAMIC (molnupiravir) and a study on ensitrelvir, another antiviral from Japan. It is also clear from these studies that the effect size is small — meaning that we cannot solely rely on antivirals to completely prevent long COVID.\n\nHealio: What should clinicians take from these findings?\n\nAl-Aly: In high-risk individuals, antivirals reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 illness and may also reduce the risk of long COVID. They remain massively underutilized. Clinicians should be cognizant of adverse events, drug-drug interactions (for example, with Paxlovid), and the mutagenic potential of molnupiravir (it induces mutations in SARS-CoV-2). But they should also consider potential benefits.\n\nHealio: What do you hope they take away from your related commentary?\n\nAl-Aly: The PANORAMIC results suggest that blocking viral replication in the acute phase — via molnupiravir — reduced the risk of long Covid. This is an important clue — that hitting the virus early, diminishing its ability to replicate and suppressing viral load may hold promise in preventing long COVID. We need to continue to investigate the role of antivirals in preventing and treating long COVID and figure out ways to optimize their effectiveness. Trials to test combinations of antivirals, longer duration of treatment, etc., should be pursued.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Al-Aly Z.
