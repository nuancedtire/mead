A recent Swedish study highlights this alarming association:  \n  \n- KEY FINDING: In unvaccinated individuals, the presence of antibodies against rubella is linked to a heightened risk of MS. The study suggests this could be due to a misdirected immune response triggered by the virus, echoing theories around "molecular mimicry."  \n  \n- 📊 In the analyzed blood samples, nearly 93.7% of MS patients had anti-E1 antibodies, compared to 88.5% in healthy controls. More strikingly, unvaccinated MS patients were found to be FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY to display rubella antibodies than their healthy counterparts.  \n  \n- In contrast, no significant difference in seropositivity was observed among vaccinated individuals, indicating vaccination may serve as a protective measure against this potential risk.  \n  \n- The researchers caution that while these findings are significant, further serological and epidemiological studies are essential to establish a clearer understanding of the relationship between rubella infection and MS development.  \n  \nAs healthcare providers, what role do you think vaccinations play in mitigating risks for conditions like MS? 🤷\u200d♂️  \nFor further reading, check out the full study here: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.16387', ['Research & Clinical Trials', 'Neurology', 'InfectiousDiseases', 'HealthcareInnovation', 'ClinicalTrials', 'PatientSafety'], 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/7231416/pexels-photo-7231416.jpeg', 'https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/09/09/ms-risk-unvaccinated-people-elevated-rubella-infection-study/', 'You are a social media content strategist tasked with creating ready-to-use social media posts aimed at healthcare professionals.

The reason for the immune response isn’t fully understood, but evidence suggests viral infections may be risk factors. Infection with the [Epstein-Barr virus](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/) (EBV), in particular, is one of the strongest risk factors for the neurodegenerative condition and some studies have found an association between MS and the human herpesvirus-6A. Also, up to 78% of MS patients have antibodies against measles, varicella zoster, and rubella viruses in their spinal fluid.\n\nIt’s believed that, due to some similarities between viral and human molecules, the immune system may mistakenly attack nerve cells when trying to fight a viral infection. This “molecular mimicry” is one proposed mechanism that may explain the association between viruses and a greater risk of MS.\n\nThe rubella virus has several proteins that share similarities with human proteins. One protein from its envelope, called E2, is similar to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), an essential protein in myelin, the fatty coating that covers nerve cells and target of immune responses in MS.\n\nThese similarities raise the possibility of a connection between the rubella virus, the immune response against it, and developing MS.\n\nResearchers in Sweden compared blood samples from MS patients and controls collected before the neurological disease’s onset to determine if people who developed MS had signs of a previous rubella infection — determined through the presence of anti-rubella antibodies — before their diagnosis.\n\n“With samples from both the pre-\xadvaccination era and through the different stages of rubella vaccination in Sweden, we explored a unique opportunity to study [the rubella virus] in the field of MS,” the researchers wrote.\n\nThe study included blood samples from 670 MS patients and 670 matched controls. In both groups, female patients represented the majority (84%) and the median age was 25.\n\nThe researchers tested the samples for the presence of antibodies (seropositivity) that targeted the rubella E1 protein, which the virus uses to infect human cells, and their reactivity. More MS patients (93.7%) had anti-E1 antibodies than healthy controls (88.5%), data showed.\n\nWhen patients and controls were divided based on their rubella vaccination status, seropositivity was only significantly higher in MS patients than controls in unvaccinated people, in whom the presence of antibodies indicates a previous rubella infection. After adjusting for factors such as antibodies against other viruses and vitamin D levels, unvaccinated MS patients were four times more likely to have rubella antibodies than unvaccinated controls. No significant differences were observed in vaccinated patients after accounting for the same factors.\n\nThe presence of antibodies in “unvaccinated subjects (i.e., representing rubella infection) was associated with a higher risk of developing MS,” the researchers wrote. “Molecular mimicry is an attractive hypothesis for a possible mechanism behind these findings.”\n\nThe researchers advised caution when interpreting their findings, mainly because the test they used to determine seropositivity can have a lot of false negatives. Also, most of the participants received the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, adding variables that weren’t evaluated in the study.\n\n“Further serological and epidemiological studies are needed to support our findings,” they wrote.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

An earlier interim study readout from the ongoing Phase 3 trial, DIAGNODE-3, is planned to serve as the basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) under the accelerated approval pathway. Results from the interim readout are expected around March 2026.\n\n"We are committed to working at full speed with our partners and in close dialogue with the FDA to seize this unprecedented opportunity of making Diamyd® available to patients as quickly as possible," says Ulf Hannelius, CEO of Diamyd Medical. "The earlier readout from the DIAGNODE-3 trial represents a critical step in this process and our confidence in Diamyd®\'s disease-modifying benefits is boosted by the positive outcome of the recently announced futility analysis. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to ensure that all necessary regulatory requirements are met."\n\nDiamyd Medical recently announced Fast track designation in the U.S. for Diamyd®, and that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has acknowledged that accelerated approval could be sought based on a demonstration of significant treatment-related benefits on C-peptide levels, a measure of endogenous insulin production, in response to Diamyd® administration. The FDA\'s Accelerated approval program allows drugs for serious conditions that fills an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. Using a surrogate endpoint allows the FDA the potential to approve these drugs faster.\n\nTo prepare the BLA under the FDA\'s Accelerated Approval Program, Diamyd Medical plans to conduct an interim study readout, including efficacy data from approximately 170 participants who have completed their 15-month assessment and safety data from additional individuals enrolled in the DIAGNODE-3 trial. The primary endpoint for this analysis will be C-peptide, a surrogate endpoint now recognized by the FDA as reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Following the interim readout, the DIAGNODE-3 trial will continue to follow all enrolled patients until the 24-month end-of-study assessment. To date, 148 patients have been randomized in DIAGNODE-3. The results of the interim study readout are expected around March 2026, the exact time depending on the final number of participants to be included in the readout, followed by submission of a BLA under the accelerated approval pathway.\n\nThe DIAGNODE-3 trial, which is being conducted in eight European countries and the United States, is expected to fully recruit approximately 330 patients by the end of 2025, and all patients are expected to be fully treated before the time the earlier readout is to be performed. The trial focuses on recently diagnosed patients with Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes carrying the HLA DR3-DQ2 genotype; a subgroup of approximately 40% of Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes patients that has been shown to respond to Diamyd® in previous trials.\n\n**About Diamyd Medical**\n\nDiamyd Medical develops precision medicine therapies for the prevention and treatment of Type 1 Diabetes and LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults). Diamyd® is an antigen-specific immunomodulatory therapeutic for the preservation of endogenous insulin production that has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. as well as Fast Track Designation by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of Stage 1, 2 and 3 Type 1 Diabetes. DIAGNODE-3, a confirmatory Phase III trial is actively recruiting patients with recent-onset (Stage 3) Type 1 Diabetes in eight European countries and in the US. Significant results have previously been shown in a large genetically predefined patient group - in a large-scale meta-analysis as well as in the Company\'s prospective European Phase IIb trial, where Diamyd® was administered directly into a superficial lymph node in children and young adults with recently diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes. Injections into a superficial lymphnode can be performed in minutes and are intended to optimize the treatment response. A biomanufacturing facility is under development in Umeå, Sweden, for the manufacture of recombinant GAD65 protein, the active ingredient in the antigen-specific immunotherapy Diamyd®. Diamyd Medical also develops the GABA-based investigational drug Remygen® as a component in the treatments of metabolic diseases. Diamyd Medical is a major shareholder in the stem cell company NextCell Pharma AB and in the artificial intelligence company MainlyAI AB.\n\nDiamyd Medical\'s B-share is traded on Nasdaq First North Growth Market under the ticker DMYD B.

The SMC in Scotland backed NHS use of the drug in October 2023.\n\nThe new NICE recommendation is conditional, meaning that Welireg can be used while more evidence for its efficacy is collected, according to Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE. It comes after NHS England reached a commercial access deal with the manufacturer.\n\nThe appraisal committee heard from patient experts who explained that some people with VHL have a wide variety of debilitating symptoms depending on where the tumours are growing in the body. These include pain, loss of balance and motor skills, loss of vision, breathlessness, coughing, headaches, confusion, severe nausea, and fatigue.\n\nGraham Lovitt, chair of patient advocacy group VHL UK/Ireland, said Welireg has "game-changing potential" and has shown extraordinary results for some patients in trials, including stabilisation of the tumours, reduction in growth, and – in some cases – the eradication of tumours altogether.\n\n"We are delighted by NICE\'s recommendation of belzutifan […] a significant milestone in the fight against this rare disease," he added. "This decision brings hope to qualifying patients and their families, offering them an alternative treatment option, when others become too high risk."\n\nWelireg (belzutifan), an oral HIF-2 alpha inhibitor, has been approved by the UK drugs regulator the MHRA for VHL since May 2022.

The new mRNA vaccine candidate more effectively limits symptoms and disease duration in non-human primates infected with a lethal strain of mpox.\n\nAlec Freyn, virology researcher at Moderna and co-first author, stated: “This study is the first in a nonhuman primate model where we compare an investigational mRNA mpox vaccine directly to the current standard of care.” He continued: “When we put those vaccines head-to-head in primates, we saw improved responses from the mRNA vaccine in terms of not just protection from survival but also fewer lesions, shorter duration of disease, and less viral shedding in the blood and respiratory tract.”\n\nOriginally designed to combat smallpox, MVA vaccines contained weakened whole viruses. Yet, this weakening means that they provide limited protection compared to other vaccines. The use of mRNA technology enables vaccines to be developed to only include parts of the virus that are most likely to induce a lasting, protective immune response without exposing the person to a whole infectious virus. The investigational mpox mRNA vaccine is composed of four viral antigens that are essential for the virus to attach and enter host cells.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated that mRNA vaccines can prevent lethal mpox infections in nonhuman primates but their ability to lessen disease severity has not been tested. Therefore, to directly compare the investigational mRNA vaccine to MVA vaccines, the team vaccinated six macaques with each vaccine and then exposed them to a lethal strain of mpox virus eight weeks after their initial vaccine dose. Also, they exposed a control group of six unvaccinated animals to mpox. Then, after infection, the researchers monitored the macaque’s health for four weeks and collected blood samples to study their immune response.\n\nDisease severity\n----------------\n\nFive of the unvaccinated control animals did not survive, whereas all 12 vaccinated animals did, regardless of which vaccine was used. The mRNA-vaccinated animals lost less weight and had fewer lesions than MVA-vaccinated animals, despite both vaccines limiting disease severity compared to the control group.\n\nFurthermore, the mRNA vaccine shortened disease duration, measured by the number of days for which the animals showed lesions, by more than 10 days compared to the MVA vaccine. Lower viral loads were in the blood and throat swabs, indicating that it might be more effective at reducing transmission.\n\nJay Hooper, virologist at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and senior author explained: “With the mRNA technology, we’re able to produce a vaccine that gives quite potent responses with a very tolerable safety profile…We’ve been trying to get a vaccine that will prevent spread like ACAM2000® but without the safety issues. This is showing that mRNA technology might be able to fill that niche.”\n\nImmune response\n---------------\n\nThe mRNA vaccine resulted in a higher number of antibodies and antibodies with more diverse immune functions. Different classes of antibodies that were associated with enhanced viral control and fewer lesions were identified.\n\nFurthermore, the vaccine demonstrated potential to induce cross-immunity to other Orthopoxviruses, whereas the MVA vaccine results in smaller immune responses that are not as strongly neutralising for more remotely related Orthopoxviruses. Serum from the macaques immunised with the mRNA vaccine “neutralised not only mpox but also vaccinia, cowpox, rabbitpox, camelpox, and ectromelia virus,” Freyn said. “We believe that this vaccine may protect from other Orthopoxvirus threats that may emerge in the future.”\n\nNow, Moderna’s mRNA-1769 vaccine is being assessed in a Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT05995275) to determine the safety, tolerability and immune response of a range of doses of mRNA-1769.\n\nThis study was published in Cell.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

In the study, Nucala was added to inhaled maintenance therapy for COPD.\n\nGSK has been studying Nucala in COPD for some time, and in 2017 reported mixed results for the drug in two earlier phase 3 trials called METREX and METREO.\n\nMETREX involved patients with a range of eosinophil levels and showed a statistically significant improvement for Nucala versus placebo on exacerbation rates. However, in METREO – which focused on patients with higher levels only – the difference between the two arms was not significant.\n\nThe company decided to file for approval regardless, but the FDA declined to approve the new indication in 2018, following the advice of an advisory committee, which found that GSK had not proved efficacy. It seems MATINEE will allow GSK to try its luck again.\n\nThe size of the improvement over placebo – which reportedly extended for up to two years in the trial – won\'t be available until the study is presented at a future medical congress, but is strong enough to warrant discussions with regulators about extending the indications for Nucala, according to the pharma group. It has previously suggested approval for COPD could come in the US in the first half of next year.\n\nNucala has been approved to treat severe eosinophilic asthma for almost a decade, and in the interim has had its label extended to include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome.\n\nThe drug remains one of GSK\'s top products, with sales of £856 million ($1.1 billion) in the first half of this year, up 15%. COPD could open up a massive new market for the drug, which still has several years of patent life left before it could face biosimilar competition.\n\nThe lung disease affects more than 300 million people globally, with up to 40% of patients exhibiting type 2 inflammation characterised by a raised blood eosinophil count, which would make them suitable for treatment with Nucala.\n\nElevated eosinophil levels are associated with more severe COPD and a higher rate of exacerbations, the sudden flare-ups in symptoms that signal the progression of the disease and can lead to hospitalisation.\n\nThe MATINEE data comes at a time when options for COPD are on the up, after a decade with no new therapies.\n\nIn July, the European Commission became the first regulator worldwide to approve Sanofi and Regeneron\'s big-selling IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor Dupixent (dupilumab) as a treatment for the progressive lung disease, shortly after Verona Pharma got the go-ahead from the US FDA for its PDE 3/4 inhibitor Ohtuvayre (ensifentrine).\n\nDupixent – which is due for a verdict from the FDA as a COPD therapy later this month – was cleared for adults with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils, while Ohtuvayre can be used in all patients regardless of eosinophil levels.', 'gpt-4o-mini']
