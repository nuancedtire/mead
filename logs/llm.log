In the trial, notable survival benefit was observed—thus, many practices are adopting this as a new standard.\n- Real-world data from clinical experiences indicate that patients have tolerated the combination well, with manageable side effects, which is crucial for maintaining quality of life.\n- Additionally, oncologists report that careful monitoring for adverse events is essential, especially in patients with underlying liver conditions, to mitigate risks associated with immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy.\n\nAs we witness this promising shift in clinical applications, how do you see the role of combination therapies evolving in the management of liver cancer? 🤔\n\nFor a deeper dive into clinical experiences and insights, read more here: https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/using-atezolizumab-bevacizumab-in-practice', ['Life Sciences & BioTech', 'Oncology', 'ClinicalTrials', 'PrecisionMedicine', 'PatientSafety'], 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/6436249/pexels-photo-6436249.jpeg', 'https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/using-atezolizumab-bevacizumab-in-practice', 'You are a social media content strategist tasked with creating ready-to-use social media posts aimed at healthcare professionals.

The reason for the immune response isn’t fully understood, but evidence suggests viral infections may be risk factors. Infection with the [Epstein-Barr virus](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/) (EBV), in particular, is one of the strongest risk factors for the neurodegenerative condition and some studies have found an association between MS and the human herpesvirus-6A. Also, up to 78% of MS patients have antibodies against measles, varicella zoster, and rubella viruses in their spinal fluid.\n\nIt’s believed that, due to some similarities between viral and human molecules, the immune system may mistakenly attack nerve cells when trying to fight a viral infection. This “molecular mimicry” is one proposed mechanism that may explain the association between viruses and a greater risk of MS.\n\nThe rubella virus has several proteins that share similarities with human proteins. One protein from its envelope, called E2, is similar to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), an essential protein in [myelin](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/), the fatty coating that covers nerve cells and target of immune responses in MS.\n\nThese similarities raise the possibility of a connection between the rubella virus, the immune response against it, and developing MS.\n\nResearchers in Sweden compared blood samples from MS patients and controls collected before the neurological disease’s onset to determine if people who developed MS had signs of a previous rubella infection — determined through the presence of anti-rubella antibodies — before their diagnosis.\n\n“With samples from both the pre-\xadvaccination era and through the different stages of rubella vaccination in Sweden, we explored a unique opportunity to study [the rubella virus] in the field of MS,” the researchers wrote.\n\nThe study included blood samples from 670 MS patients and 670 matched controls. In both groups, female patients represented the majority (84%) and the median age was 25.\n\nThe researchers tested the samples for the presence of antibodies (seropositivity) that targeted the rubella E1 protein, which the virus uses to infect human cells, and their reactivity. More MS patients (93.7%) had anti-E1 antibodies than healthy controls (88.5%), data showed.\n\nWhen patients and controls were divided based on their rubella vaccination status, seropositivity was only significantly higher in MS patients than controls in unvaccinated people, in whom the presence of antibodies indicates a previous rubella infection. After adjusting for factors such as antibodies against other viruses and vitamin D levels, unvaccinated MS patients were four times more likely to have rubella antibodies than unvaccinated controls. No significant differences were observed in vaccinated patients after accounting for the same factors.\n\nThe presence of antibodies in “unvaccinated subjects (i.e., representing rubella infection) was associated with a higher risk of developing MS,” the researchers wrote. “Molecular mimicry is an attractive hypothesis for a possible mechanism behind these findings.”\n\nThe researchers advised caution when interpreting their findings, mainly because the test they used to determine seropositivity can have a lot of false negatives. Also, most of the participants received the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, adding variables that weren’t evaluated in the study.\n\n“Further serological and epidemiological studies are needed to support our findings,” they wrote.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

An earlier interim study readout from the ongoing Phase 3 trial, DIAGNODE-3, is planned to serve as the basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) under the accelerated approval pathway. Results from the interim readout are expected around March 2026.\n\n"We are committed to working at full speed with our partners and in close dialogue with the FDA to seize this unprecedented opportunity of making Diamyd® available to patients as quickly as possible," says Ulf Hannelius, CEO of Diamyd Medical. "The earlier readout from the DIAGNODE-3 trial represents a critical step in this process and our confidence in Diamyd®\'s disease-modifying benefits is boosted by the positive outcome of the recently announced futility analysis. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to ensure that all necessary regulatory requirements are met."\n\nDiamyd Medical recently announced Fast track designation in the U.S. for Diamyd®, and that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has acknowledged that accelerated approval could be sought based on a demonstration of significant treatment-related benefits on C-peptide levels, a measure of endogenous insulin production, in response to Diamyd® administration. The FDA\'s Accelerated approval program allows drugs for serious conditions that fills an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. Using a surrogate endpoint allows the FDA the potential to approve these drugs faster.\n\nTo prepare the BLA under the FDA\'s Accelerated Approval Program, Diamyd Medical plans to conduct an interim study readout, including efficacy data from approximately 170 participants who have completed their 15-month assessment and safety data from additional individuals enrolled in the DIAGNODE-3 trial. The primary endpoint for this analysis will be C-peptide, a surrogate endpoint now recognized by the FDA as reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Following the interim readout, the DIAGNODE-3 trial will continue to follow all enrolled patients until the 24-month end-of-study assessment. To date, 148 patients have been randomized in DIAGNODE-3. The results of the interim study readout are expected around March 2026, the exact time depending on the final number of participants to be included in the readout, followed by submission of a BLA under the accelerated approval pathway.\n\nThe DIAGNODE-3 trial, which is being conducted in eight European countries and the United States, is expected to fully recruit approximately 330 patients by the end of 2025, and all patients are expected to be fully treated before the time the earlier readout is to be performed. The trial focuses on recently diagnosed patients with Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes carrying the HLA DR3-DQ2 genotype; a subgroup of approximately 40% of Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes patients that has been shown to respond to Diamyd® in previous trials.\n\n**About Diamyd Medical**\n\nDiamyd Medical develops precision medicine therapies for the prevention and treatment of Type 1 Diabetes and LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults). Diamyd® is an antigen-specific immunomodulatory therapeutic for the preservation of endogenous insulin production that has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. as well as Fast Track Designation by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of Stage 1, 2 and 3 Type 1 Diabetes. DIAGNODE-3, a confirmatory Phase III trial is actively recruiting patients with recent-onset (Stage 3) Type 1 Diabetes in eight European countries and in the US. Significant results have previously been shown in a large genetically predefined patient group - in a large-scale meta-analysis as well as in the Company\'s prospective European Phase IIb trial, where Diamyd® was administered directly into a superficial lymph node in children and young adults with recently diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes. Injections into a superficial lymphnode can be performed in minutes and are intended to optimize the treatment response. A biomanufacturing facility is under development in Umeå, Sweden, for the manufacture of recombinant GAD65 protein, the active ingredient in the antigen-specific immunotherapy Diamyd®. Diamyd Medical also develops the GABA-based investigational drug Remygen® as a component in the treatments of metabolic diseases. Diamyd Medical is a major shareholder in the stem cell company NextCell Pharma AB and in the artificial intelligence company MainlyAI AB.\n\nDiamyd Medical\'s B-share is traded on Nasdaq First North Growth Market under the ticker DMYD B.

The SMC in Scotland backed NHS use of the drug in October 2023.\n\nThe new NICE recommendation is conditional, meaning that Welireg can be used while more evidence for its efficacy is collected, according to Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE. It comes after NHS England reached a commercial access deal with the manufacturer.\n\nThe appraisal committee heard from patient experts who explained that some people with VHL have a wide variety of debilitating symptoms depending on where the tumours are growing in the body. These include pain, loss of balance and motor skills, loss of vision, breathlessness, coughing, headaches, confusion, severe nausea, and fatigue.\n\nGraham Lovitt, chair of patient advocacy group VHL UK/Ireland, said Welireg has "game-changing potential" and has shown extraordinary results for some patients in trials, including stabilisation of the tumours, reduction in growth, and – in some cases – the eradication of tumours altogether.\n\n"We are delighted by NICE\'s recommendation of belzutifan […] a significant milestone in the fight against this rare disease," he added.

The new mRNA vaccine candidate more effectively limits symptoms and disease duration in non-human primates infected with a lethal strain of mpox.\n\nAlec Freyn, virology researcher at Moderna and co-first author, stated: “This study is the first in a nonhuman primate model where we compare an investigational mRNA mpox vaccine directly to the current standard of care.” He continued: “When we put those vaccines head-to-head in primates, we saw improved responses from the mRNA vaccine in terms of not just protection from survival but also fewer lesions, shorter duration of disease, and less viral shedding in the blood and respiratory tract.”\n\nOriginally designed to combat smallpox, MVA vaccines contained weakened whole viruses. Yet, this weakening means that they provide limited protection compared to other vaccines. The use of mRNA technology enables vaccines to be developed to only include parts of the virus that are most likely to induce a lasting, protective immune response without exposing the person to a whole infectious virus. The investigational mpox mRNA vaccine is composed of four viral antigens that are essential for the virus to attach and enter host cells.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated that mRNA vaccines can prevent lethal mpox infections in nonhuman primates but their ability to lessen disease severity has not been tested. Therefore, to directly compare the investigational mRNA vaccine to MVA vaccines, the team vaccinated six macaques with each vaccine and then exposed them to a lethal strain of mpox virus eight weeks after their initial vaccine dose. Also, they exposed a control group of six unvaccinated animals to mpox. Then, after infection, the researchers monitored the macaque’s health for four weeks and collected blood samples to study their immune response.\n\nDisease severity\n----------------\n\nFive of the unvaccinated control animals did not survive, whereas all 12 vaccinated animals did, regardless of which vaccine was used. The mRNA-vaccinated animals lost less weight and had fewer lesions than MVA-vaccinated animals, despite both vaccines limiting disease severity compared to the control group.\n\nFurthermore, the mRNA vaccine shortened disease duration, measured by the number of days for which the animals showed lesions, by more than 10 days compared to the MVA vaccine. Lower viral loads were in the blood and throat swabs, indicating that it might be more effective at reducing transmission.\n\nJay Hooper, virologist at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and senior author explained: “With the mRNA technology, we’re able to produce a vaccine that gives quite potent responses with a very tolerable safety profile…We’ve been trying to get a vaccine that will prevent spread like ACAM2000® but without the safety issues. This is showing that mRNA technology might be able to fill that niche.”\n\nImmune response\n---------------\n\nThe mRNA vaccine resulted in a higher number of antibodies and antibodies with more diverse immune functions. Different classes of antibodies that were associated with enhanced viral control and fewer lesions were identified.\n\nFurthermore, the vaccine demonstrated potential to induce cross-immunity to other Orthopoxviruses, whereas the MVA vaccine results in smaller immune responses that are not as strongly neutralising for more remotely related Orthopoxviruses. Serum from the macaques immunised with the mRNA vaccine “neutralised not only mpox but also vaccinia, cowpox, rabbitpox, camelpox, and ectromelia virus,” Freyn said. “We believe that this vaccine may protect from other Orthopoxvirus threats that may emerge in the future.”\n\nNow, Moderna’s mRNA-1769 vaccine is being assessed in a Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT05995275) to determine the safety, tolerability and immune response of a range of doses of mRNA-1769.\n\nThis study was published in Cell.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

In the study, Nucala was added to inhaled maintenance therapy for COPD.\n\nGSK has been studying Nucala in COPD for some time, and in 2017 reported mixed results for the drug in two earlier phase 3 trials called METREX and METREO.\n\nMETREX involved patients with a range of eosinophil levels and showed a statistically significant improvement for Nucala versus placebo on exacerbation rates. However, in METREO – which focused on patients with higher levels only – the difference between the two arms was not significant.\n\nThe company decided to file for approval regardless, but the FDA declined to approve the new indication in 2018, following the advice of an advisory committee, which found that GSK had not proved efficacy. It seems MATINEE will allow GSK to try its luck again.\n\nThe size of the improvement over placebo – which reportedly extended for up to two years in the trial – won\'t be available until the study is presented at a future medical congress, but is strong enough to warrant discussions with regulators about extending the indications for Nucala, according to the pharma group. It has previously suggested approval for COPD could come in the US in the first half of next year.\n\nNucala has been approved to treat severe eosinophilic asthma for almost a decade, and in the interim has had its label extended to include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome.\n\nThe drug remains one of GSK\'s top products, with sales of £856 million ($1.1 billion) in the first half of this year, up 15%. COPD could open up a massive new market for the drug, which still has several years of patent life left before it could face biosimilar competition.\n\nThe lung disease affects more than 300 million people globally, with up to 40% of patients exhibiting type 2 inflammation characterised by a raised blood eosinophil count, which would make them suitable for treatment with Nucala.\n\nElevated eosinophil levels are associated with more severe COPD and a higher rate of exacerbations, the sudden flare-ups in symptoms that signal the progression of the disease and can lead to hospitalisation.\n\nThe MATINEE data comes at a time when options for COPD are on the up, after a decade with no new therapies.\n\nIn July, the European Commission became the first regulator worldwide to approve Sanofi and Regeneron\'s big-selling IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor Dupixent (dupilumab) as a treatment for the progressive lung disease, shortly after Verona Pharma got the go-ahead from the US FDA for its PDE 3/4 inhibitor Ohtuvayre (ensifentrine).\n\nDupixent – which is due for a verdict from the FDA as a COPD therapy later this month – was cleared for adults with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils, while Ohtuvayre can be used in all patients regardless of eosinophil levels.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

The startup behind it, Zoī, promises customers a “360-degree check-up’ — a three-hour series of tests and exams, ranging from blood tests to eye scans through spirometry and gut microbiome analyses.\n\nThe objective? Collect millions of data points on up to 200 biomarkers that are in turn analysed by an AI model, in order to deliver lifestyle recommendations that, promises Zoī, will prevent disease and improve customers’ long-term wellness.\n\n“It’s not about adding years of life, but rather life to years,” says Zoī cofounder — and former special advisor to French president Emmanuel Macron — Ismaël Emélien. “The goal is to learn the body’s ‘user manual’ to prevent illnesses and enable people to live in good health for longer.”\n\nIt’s not for everyone. Membership to Zoī is €3.6k per year, which includes an annual checkup as well as the follow-up recommendations. That’s roughly the cost of a membership to Soho House, says Zoī's CFO Antoine Attali — and the startup's customers usually belong to the same social circles.\n\nThe clinic caters to premium needs, from snacks elaborated by world-famous chef Alain Ducasse to a balneotherapy section modelled on ‘Japanese thermal baths‘, featuring a snow cabin (?) and a mineral bath that is, I am told, “twice as salty as the Dead Sea”.\n\nAttali tells me that in the long-term, Zoī hopes to become accessible to everyone, and that prices will go down to a similar level to your average WiFi subscription.\n\nFor now, though, preventative health remains a hobby of the upper-class. In fact, Zoī's investors are all private individuals; the company’s €20m seed round, which it raised in 2022, included a good number of high-profile billionaires such as Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saadé and Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel.\n\nAnd Zoī is not the only longevity startup appealing to the ultra-rich. Spotify founder Daniel Ek is behind similar ventures, including [Sand Clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-ek-spotify-sand-clinic-longevity-news), where customers can receive full body check-ups and treatments ranging from vacuum therapy to red light saunas — with membership expected to cost between €1,000 and €10,000 a month.\n\nEk is also the founder of healthtech Neko Health, which has built a full-body scanner for health data collection that it says helps doctors detect potential diseases earlier. The company [has a clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/ek-neko-body-scanner-test) and has just opened a new spot in London, right in the middle of Marylebone, where it prices a one-hour scan at £299 — almost double the price of a visit to the Stockholm clinic when it opened in 2023 (€180).\n\nDespite the cost, the proposition seems appealing enough. Neko Health says it already has a waiting list of 22k people; Zoī says it has “around 1k members” to date and is currently carrying out a dozen check-ups per day — but the startup is confident that it can ramp up to reach its maximum capacity of 35k annual check-ups in the next five years.\n\nWhether or not the preventative treatments promised by startups like Zoī, Neko Health and Sand Clinic will ever reach the masses remains to be seen; what seems certain for now is that billionaires won’t get tired of full-body-scanning anytime soon.\n\n![Image 1: A photo of the entrance to Zoï's centre in Paris](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/06145636/Zoi%CC%84_WIP6_%C2%A911h45-HD-4.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThe entrance to Zoï's centre in Paris.

It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nDoccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE).\n\nDoccla’s founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.\n\n“With the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it’s a huge opportunity to scale,” says Ratz.\n\nThe virtual A&E\n\nSweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.\n\nAccording to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.\n\nPatients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.\n\nSo far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it’s adding 1k new patients every month.\n\n“Over time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,” Ratz says.\n\nPartnering with pharma\n\nDoccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).\n\n“We have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,” Ratz says. “This is because we are in very close contact with our patients.”\n\nDoccla says it’s interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he’s seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.\n\nWith 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.\n\nIn one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.\n\n“We can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits — in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,” Ratz says.\n\nDoccla has raised a total of £52m to date.\n\nIn October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.", 'gpt-4o-mini']

To find out, Sifted spoke to VCs at 415 Capital, Sofinnova Partners, MIG Capital and SHS Capital.\n\n### Linus Rieder, principal at 415 Capital\n\n#### Medical Microinstruments (MMI) – Italy\n\nMMI is building surgical robots to help with micro-surgery. Its robotics platform can be used in reconstructive surgery, plastic surgery and head-neck surgery. The startup is looking to solve key issues in microsurgery like the effects of surgeon tremor and reduces the need for microsurgery training.\n\n#### Gradient Denervation Technologies — France\n\nGradient Denervation Technologies is developing a device for treating heart failure patients with associated pulmonary hypertension. As many as half of heart failure patients around the world have elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, which is shown to lead to an increased risk of mortality and hospitalisation. There are no approved drug or device therapies for this group of pulmonary hypertension patients. By using minimally invasive ultrasound to treat hyperactive nerves in the pulmonary arteries, however, the startup’s technology has the potential to treat and help tens of thousands of patients each year.\n\n#### CorWave — France\n\nCorWave's left ventricular assist device (LVAD) mimics the natural heart's function to treat patients with advanced heart failure. This technology enables the device to replicate the heart pulses, reducing the mechanical damage to blood cells common with current LVADs.\n\n### Anne Osdoit, partner at Sofinnova Partners\n\n#### Ganymed Robotics — France\n\nGanymed is working on a robotics platform to assist surgeons with implant placement during knee replacement surgery. The Paris-based company's approach uses computer vision and artificial intelligence to perceive, and extract knowledge from, the surgical environment in a non-invasive manner, removing imaging and registration steps that add time and complexity to knee surgery.\n\n#### Gleamer — France\n\nGleamer is developing AI tools to enhance image interpretation for radiologists. The startup’s main product helps clinicians identify bone trauma at the point of care. Gleamer has achieved multiple regulatory approvals and successfully commercially deployed in both the US and EU.\n\n#### Salvia BioElectronics — The Netherlands\n\nSalvia BioElectronics is developing drug-free neuromodulation therapies — which refers to a group of medical procedures that look to change brain activity by stimulating nerves — for migraines. Salvia's paper-thin implant is designed to be placed under the forehead to reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks by delivering gentle electrical pulses to the nerves associated with the condition. The company is currently in the clinical stage, having received the Breakthrough Device Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which facilitates expedited market access for devices that treat life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating conditions.\n\n### Fei Tian, principal at MIG Capital\n\n#### Artidis — Switzerland\n\nArtidis is developing imaging tools for cancer diagnostics. It combines a nanotechnology device which analyses tissue with a digital data platform to measure the physical characteristics of both tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment. After determining if a tumour is benign or malignant, Artidis’ technology identifies if it will spread to other sites and can help inform chemotherapy and immunotherapy permeability and treatment response.\n\n#### CoreMedic — Switzerland\n\nCoreMedic has developed an implant which treats the heart condition mitral valve regurgitation (MR). The CoreMedic implant can replace ruptured mitral — a part of the heart — in a minimally invasive procedure that is physiological and reproducible, promising long-term clinical benefits.\n\n### Cornelius Maas, partner at SHS Capital\n\n#### Vitestro — The Netherlands\n\nVitestro is developing an autonomous blood drawing device. This innovative device combines robotics and AI to perform blood drawing more efficiently and safely. Over the past year, Vitestro has made significant strides in clinical trials and secured an additional €20m in funding in April. Vitestro’s tool could mean less burden for patients, less work for the medical staff and consequently reduce costs for the healthcare system.\n\n#### Saphenus — Austria\n\nSaphenus is developing sensory feedback systems for prosthetics. Their key product, the Suralis system, provides users of lower-limb prosthetics with the sensation of foot contact, significantly improving balance and gait. Recently, Saphenus received FDA approval with their Suralis systema and received reimbursement status with key German medical insurers.\n\n#### Bluedrop Medical — Ireland\n\nBluedrop Medical is developing a medical device to monitor foot health and prevent diabetic foot ulcers. It looks like a weighing scale and aims to enable early detection of foot ulcers, which can lead to amputation. Bluedrop Medical is a good example of how remote monitoring can replace doctor visits while preventing serious disease progression, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.", 'gpt-4o-mini']

The fresh funding tops up the startup’s $130m Series C, raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.\n\nIt’s the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.\n\nCaresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.\n\n### AI for hospitals\n\nCaresyntax says it wants to build the “Android” platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals’ surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.\n\nThe company’s platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.\n\nWhile some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax’s platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.\n\n“Effectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,” they add.\n\nIf it does what it sets out to do, it’s a big opportunity.\n\nCosts associated with operations account for 30% of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends 11% of GDP on health.\n\nFounded in 2013 in Germany — Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 — its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company’s revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.\n\n### The rise of smart surgery\n\nThe round comes on the back of a strong 18 months for startups developing tech for the operating theatre.\n\nSince the start of 2023, three of the four biggest medtech raises have all gone to startups building robots to help surgeons.

It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.\n\n“For us [GLP-1 drugs] are already a strong growth driver,” he says. “The newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.”\n\nWhile treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva’s overall business — Eberhardt says it’s growing total patient and revenue numbers by “double digit” percentage points year-on-year — the meds could become the startup’s “largest” growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.\n\n### Riding the wave\n\nOviva’s not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity — many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.\n\nIn the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart’s CEO, food sales have fallen as the one in eight adults in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe’s most valuable company, propping up Denmark’s GDP in the process.\n\nAll of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have convinced them to get out their chequebook: Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a €10m Series A in August 2023 a year on from a €3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised €3.1m last summer.\n\nMany startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn’t start life offering them — largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.\n\nUK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a “men’s health” brand, but has recently changed that. The company’s website uses images of men and women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.\n\nYazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.\n\nMeurling tells Sifted it had hit €14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It’s now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.\n\nOther startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men’s sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.\n\n“[GLP-1 meds] are a game changer,” says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be “strange” if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn’t looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.\n\nWhile GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the “hype” surrounding the drug class has “opened doors” for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler — adding that the startup managed to raise its €400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It’s now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it’ll look to target US employers — who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.\n\n### Kinks in the supply chain\n\nThere are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector — not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.\n\nSome of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate’s $100m in 2021 and Form Health’s $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than €10m in a single round.\n\nInvestors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics — Manual was still selling past the deadline.\n\nIf a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.\n\n“As there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.”\n\n### Who’ll stump up the cash?\n\nThere’s also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.\n\nWhile Numan’s head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the “success of private sector companies offering GLP-1 [drugs] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS”, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won’t be enough to hit real scale.\n\n“US investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts [selling to whole organisations like health insurers],” says Syhler. “This means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care — where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.”\n\nIn Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.\n\nIn the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.\n\nOviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS — but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it’s in “mature dialogues with several health systems”.\n\n“It is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,” says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that don’t always want to work with startups. Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.\n\nWhether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen — but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. “I've never been an investor in a company that’s got so much attention — in a space that’s got so much attention,” says Arnardottir.", 'gpt-4o-mini']

"Identifying these conditions via 24h-ABPM may provide a cost-effective risk stratification tool in this high-risk population."\n\n**SOURCE:**\n-----------\n\nThe study was presented by lead author Lorenzo Nesti, PhD, of the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in a poster presentation 983 at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2024 Annual Meeting in Madrid, Spain.\n\n**LIMITATIONS:**\n----------------\n\nThe CHAMPION study is a retrospective, observational, single-center study with mostly White patients.\n\n**DISCLOSURES:**\n----------------\n\nNesti disclosed no conflicts of interest.\n\nMedscape Medical News © 2024 WebMD, LLC  \nSend comments and news tips to news@medscape.net.\n\nCite this: Abnormal Heart Rate Shifts Tied to Risk for Death in Diabetes - Medscape - September 09, 2024.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

A recent Swedish study suggests an intriguing link between rubella infection and an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) for unvaccinated individuals.\n\n- KEY FINDINGS: The study found that having antibodies against the rubella virus correlated with a higher MS risk among those who were unvaccinated. This could imply that rubella may act as a risk factor for the disease, providing support for the viral trigger hypothesis in MS.\n- STUDY INSIGHTS: Conducted on blood samples from 670 MS patients and matched controls, the research revealed that 93.7% of MS patients had anti-E1 antibodies, compared to 88.5% of healthy controls. Notably, unvaccinated MS patients were found to be four times more likely to have these antibodies compared to their unvaccinated counterparts.\n- MECHANISM AT PLAY: The researchers propose that “molecular mimicry,” where the immune response against the rubella virus may inadvertently target similar human molecules, could explain this increased risk. The rubella virus shares protein similarities with myelin proteins essential in nerve function.\n\nWhile these findings are promising, the authors urge caution due to possible false negatives in serological testing and the limited variable assessment of past vaccination statuses. As we reconsider MS risk factors, this emphasizes the need for further studies to validate these claims and deepen our understanding of viral implications in neurodegenerative diseases. \n\nWhat does this mean for your clinical practice?

The reason for the immune response isn’t fully understood, but evidence suggests viral infections may be risk factors. Infection with the [Epstein-Barr virus](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/) (EBV), in particular, is one of the strongest risk factors for the neurodegenerative condition and some studies have found an association between MS and the human herpesvirus-6A. Also, up to 78% of MS patients have antibodies against measles, varicella zoster, and rubella viruses in their spinal fluid.\n\nIt’s believed that, due to some similarities between viral and human molecules, the immune system may mistakenly attack nerve cells when trying to fight a viral infection. This “molecular mimicry” is one proposed mechanism that may explain the association between viruses and a greater risk of MS.\n\nThe rubella virus has several proteins that share similarities with human proteins. One protein from its envelope, called E2, is similar to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), an essential protein in [myelin](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/), the fatty coating that covers nerve cells and target of immune responses in MS.\n\nThese similarities raise the possibility of a connection between the rubella virus, the immune response against it, and developing MS.\n\nResearchers in Sweden compared blood samples from MS patients and controls collected before the neurological disease’s onset to determine if people who developed MS had signs of a previous rubella infection — determined through the presence of anti-rubella antibodies — before their diagnosis.\n\n“With samples from both the pre-\xadvaccination era and through the different stages of rubella vaccination in Sweden, we explored a unique opportunity to study [the rubella virus] in the field of MS,” the researchers wrote.\n\nThe study included blood samples from 670 MS patients and 670 matched controls. In both groups, female patients represented the majority (84%) and the median age was 25.\n\nThe researchers tested the samples for the presence of antibodies (seropositivity) that targeted the rubella E1 protein, which the virus uses to infect human cells, and their reactivity. More MS patients (93.7%) had anti-E1 antibodies than healthy controls (88.5%), data showed.\n\nWhen patients and controls were divided based on their rubella vaccination status, seropositivity was only significantly higher in MS patients than controls in unvaccinated people, in whom the presence of antibodies indicates a previous rubella infection. After adjusting for factors such as antibodies against other viruses and vitamin D levels, unvaccinated MS patients were four times more likely to have rubella antibodies than unvaccinated controls. No significant differences were observed in vaccinated patients after accounting for the same factors.\n\nThe presence of antibodies in “unvaccinated subjects (i.e., representing rubella infection) was associated with a higher risk of developing MS,” the researchers wrote. “Molecular mimicry is an attractive hypothesis for a possible mechanism behind these findings.”\n\nThe researchers advised caution when interpreting their findings, mainly because the test they used to determine seropositivity can have a lot of false negatives. Also, most of the participants received the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, adding variables that weren’t evaluated in the study.\n\n“Further serological and epidemiological studies are needed to support our findings,” they wrote.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

An earlier interim study readout from the ongoing Phase 3 trial, DIAGNODE-3, is planned to serve as the basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) under the accelerated approval pathway. Results from the interim readout are expected around March 2026.\n\n"We are committed to working at full speed with our partners and in close dialogue with the FDA to seize this unprecedented opportunity of making Diamyd® available to patients as quickly as possible," says Ulf Hannelius, CEO of Diamyd Medical. "The earlier readout from the DIAGNODE-3 trial represents a critical step in this process and our confidence in Diamyd®\'s disease-modifying benefits is boosted by the positive outcome of the recently announced futility analysis. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to ensure that all necessary regulatory requirements are met."\n\nDiamyd Medical recently announced Fast track designation in the U.S. for Diamyd®, and that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has acknowledged that accelerated approval could be sought based on a demonstration of significant treatment-related benefits on C-peptide levels, a measure of endogenous insulin production, in response to Diamyd® administration. The FDA\'s Accelerated approval program allows drugs for serious conditions that fills an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. Using a surrogate endpoint allows the FDA the potential to approve these drugs faster.\n\nTo prepare the BLA under the FDA\'s Accelerated Approval Program, Diamyd Medical plans to conduct an interim study readout, including efficacy data from approximately 170 participants who have completed their 15-month assessment and safety data from additional individuals enrolled in the DIAGNODE-3 trial. The primary endpoint for this analysis will be C-peptide, a surrogate endpoint now recognized by the FDA as reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Following the interim readout, the DIAGNODE-3 trial will continue to follow all enrolled patients until the 24-month end-of-study assessment. To date, 148 patients have been randomized in DIAGNODE-3. The results of the interim study readout are expected around March 2026, the exact time depending on the final number of participants to be included in the readout, followed by submission of a BLA under the accelerated approval pathway.\n\nThe DIAGNODE-3 trial, which is being conducted in eight European countries and the United States, is expected to fully recruit approximately 330 patients by the end of 2025, and all patients are expected to be fully treated before the time the earlier readout is to be performed. The trial focuses on recently diagnosed patients with Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes carrying the HLA DR3-DQ2 genotype; a subgroup of approximately 40% of Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes patients that has been shown to respond to Diamyd® in previous trials.\n\n**About Diamyd Medical**\n\nDiamyd Medical develops precision medicine therapies for the prevention and treatment of Type 1 Diabetes and LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults). Diamyd® is an antigen-specific immunomodulatory therapeutic for the preservation of endogenous insulin production that has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. as well as Fast Track Designation by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of Stage 1, 2 and 3 Type 1 Diabetes. DIAGNODE-3, a confirmatory Phase III trial is actively recruiting patients with recent-onset (Stage 3) Type 1 Diabetes in eight European countries and in the US. Significant results have previously been shown in a large genetically predefined patient group - in a large-scale meta-analysis as well as in the Company\'s prospective European Phase IIb trial, where Diamyd® was administered directly into a superficial lymph node in children and young adults with recently diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes. Injections into a superficial lymphnode can be performed in minutes and are intended to optimize the treatment response. A biomanufacturing facility is under development in Umeå, Sweden, for the manufacture of recombinant GAD65 protein, the active ingredient in the antigen-specific immunotherapy Diamyd®. Diamyd Medical also develops the GABA-based investigational drug Remygen® as a component in the treatments of metabolic diseases. Diamyd Medical is a major shareholder in the stem cell company NextCell Pharma AB and in the artificial intelligence company MainlyAI AB.\n\nDiamyd Medical\'s B-share is traded on Nasdaq First North Growth Market under the ticker DMYD B.

This comes nearly a year after Scottish approval.\n- Welireg is now an option specifically for treating VHL-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), brain and spinal cord tumours (haemangioblastomas), or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs), especially when surgery isn’t viable. 🎉\n- Previously, options were limited to invasive surgeries or radiotherapy, often requiring recurrent operations throughout a patient’s life.\n- With roughly 600 VHL patients in England, about 100 are expected to benefit from Welireg, with an additional 50 cases each year thereafter. This represents a significant improvement in management for these patients.\n- After a previous hesitance from NICE regarding economic evidence, the route is now clearer for healthcare providers following an access agreement with NHS England. The decision is conditional, allowing for continued collection of efficacy data. 📈\n- As highlighted by patient representatives, Welireg shows 'game-changing potential,' with some patients in trials experiencing stabilization, reduced growth, or even eradication of tumours. \n\nHow might the introduction of Welireg alter patient management and expectations for those with VHL? 🤔 \n\nFor a deeper dive, check out the details here: https://pharmaphorum.com/news/nice-clears-nhs-use-msds-welireg-genetic-disorder", ['Healthcare & Policy', 'HealthcareInnovation', 'ClinicalTrials', 'HealthTech', 'PatientSupport'], 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/6436249/pexels-photo-6436249.jpeg', 'https://pharmaphorum.com/news/nice-clears-nhs-use-msds-welireg-genetic-disorder', 'You are a social media content strategist tasked with creating ready-to-use social media posts aimed at healthcare professionals.

The SMC in Scotland backed NHS use of the drug in October 2023.\n\nThe new NICE recommendation is conditional, meaning that Welireg can be used while more evidence for its efficacy is collected, according to Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE. It comes after NHS England reached a commercial access deal with the manufacturer.\n\nThe appraisal committee heard from patient experts who explained that some people with VHL have a wide variety of debilitating symptoms depending on where the tumours are growing in the body. These include pain, loss of balance and motor skills, loss of vision, breathlessness, coughing, headaches, confusion, severe nausea, and fatigue.\n\nGraham Lovitt, chair of patient advocacy group VHL UK/Ireland, said Welireg has "game-changing potential" and has shown extraordinary results for some patients in trials, including stabilisation of the tumours, reduction in growth, and – in some cases – the eradication of tumours altogether.\n\n"We are delighted by NICE\'s recommendation of belzutifan […] a significant milestone in the fight against this rare disease," he added. "This decision brings hope to qualifying patients and their families, offering them an alternative treatment option, when others become too high risk."\n\nWelireg (belzutifan), an oral HIF-2 alpha inhibitor, has been approved by the UK drugs regulator the MHRA for VHL since May 2022. MSD acquired it as part of its $2.2 billion takeover of Peloton Therapeutics in 2019.\n\nDespite the rarity of VHL tumours, MSD has blockbuster aspirations for Welireg, and now has a second regulatory approval for the drug in relapsed or refractory advanced RCC, with clinical trials on the go in glioblastoma multiforme, a hard-to-treat form of brain cancer.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

The new mRNA vaccine candidate more effectively limits symptoms and disease duration in non-human primates infected with a lethal strain of mpox.\n\nAlec Freyn, virology researcher at Moderna and co-first author, stated: “This study is the first in a nonhuman primate model where we compare an investigational mRNA mpox vaccine directly to the current standard of care.” He continued: “When we put those vaccines head-to-head in primates, we saw improved responses from the mRNA vaccine in terms of not just protection from survival but also fewer lesions, shorter duration of disease, and less viral shedding in the blood and respiratory tract.”\n\nOriginally designed to combat smallpox, MVA vaccines contained weakened whole viruses. Yet, this weakening means that they provide limited protection compared to other vaccines. The use of mRNA technology enables vaccines to be developed to only include parts of the virus that are most likely to induce a lasting, protective immune response without exposing the person to a whole infectious virus. The investigational mpox mRNA vaccine is composed of four viral antigens that are essential for the virus to attach and enter host cells.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated that mRNA vaccines can prevent lethal mpox infections in nonhuman primates but their ability to lessen disease severity has not been tested. Therefore, to directly compare the investigational mRNA vaccine to MVA vaccines, the team vaccinated six macaques with each vaccine and then exposed them to a lethal strain of mpox virus eight weeks after their initial vaccine dose. Also, they exposed a control group of six unvaccinated animals to mpox. Then, after infection, the researchers monitored the macaque’s health for four weeks and collected blood samples to study their immune response.\n\nDisease severity\n----------------\n\nFive of the unvaccinated control animals did not survive, whereas all 12 vaccinated animals did, regardless of which vaccine was used. The mRNA-vaccinated animals lost less weight and had fewer lesions than MVA-vaccinated animals, despite both vaccines limiting disease severity compared to the control group.\n\nFurthermore, the mRNA vaccine shortened disease duration, measured by the number of days for which the animals showed lesions, by more than 10 days compared to the MVA vaccine. Lower viral loads were in the blood and throat swabs, indicating that it might be more effective at reducing transmission.\n\nJay Hooper, virologist at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and senior author explained: “With the mRNA technology, we’re able to produce a vaccine that gives quite potent responses with a very tolerable safety profile…We’ve been trying to get a vaccine that will prevent spread like ACAM2000® but without the safety issues. This is showing that mRNA technology might be able to fill that niche.”\n\nImmune response\n---------------\n\nThe mRNA vaccine resulted in a higher number of antibodies and antibodies with more diverse immune functions. Different classes of antibodies that were associated with enhanced viral control and fewer lesions were identified.\n\nFurthermore, the vaccine demonstrated potential to induce cross-immunity to other Orthopoxviruses, whereas the MVA vaccine results in smaller immune responses that are not as strongly neutralising for more remotely related Orthopoxviruses. Serum from the macaques immunised with the mRNA vaccine “neutralised not only mpox but also vaccinia, cowpox, rabbitpox, camelpox, and ectromelia virus,” Freyn said. “We believe that this vaccine may protect from other Orthopoxvirus threats that may emerge in the future.”\n\nNow, Moderna’s mRNA-1769 vaccine is being assessed in a Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT05995275) to determine the safety, tolerability and immune response of a range of doses of mRNA-1769.\n\nThis study was published in Cell.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

In the study, Nucala was added to inhaled maintenance therapy for COPD.\n\nGSK has been studying Nucala in COPD for some time, and in 2017 reported mixed results for the drug in two earlier phase 3 trials called METREX and METREO.\n\nMETREX involved patients with a range of eosinophil levels and showed a statistically significant improvement for Nucala versus placebo on exacerbation rates. However, in METREO – which focused on patients with higher levels only – the difference between the two arms was not significant.\n\nThe company decided to file for approval regardless, but the FDA declined to approve the new indication in 2018, following the advice of an advisory committee, which found that GSK had not proved efficacy. It seems MATINEE will allow GSK to try its luck again.\n\nThe size of the improvement over placebo – which reportedly extended for up to two years in the trial – won\'t be available until the study is presented at a future medical congress, but is strong enough to warrant discussions with regulators about extending the indications for Nucala, according to the pharma group. It has previously suggested approval for COPD could come in the US in the first half of next year.\n\nNucala has been approved to treat severe eosinophilic asthma for almost a decade, and in the interim has had its label extended to include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome.\n\nThe drug remains one of GSK\'s top products, with sales of £856 million ($1.1 billion) in the first half of this year, up 15%.

The startup behind it, Zoī, promises customers a “360-degree check-up’ — a three-hour series of tests and exams, ranging from blood tests to eye scans through spirometry and gut microbiome analyses.\n\nThe objective? Collect millions of data points on up to 200 biomarkers that are in turn analysed by an AI model, in order to deliver lifestyle recommendations that, promises Zoī, will prevent disease and improve customers’ long-term wellness.\n\n“It’s not about adding years of life, but rather life to years,” says Zoī cofounder — and former special advisor to French president Emmanuel Macron — Ismaël Emélien. “The goal is to learn the body’s ‘user manual’ to prevent illnesses and enable people to live in good health for longer.”\n\nIt’s not for everyone. Membership to Zoī is €3.6k per year, which includes an annual checkup as well as the follow-up recommendations. That’s roughly the cost of a membership to Soho House, says Zoī's CFO Antoine Attali — and the startup's customers usually belong to the same social circles.\n\nThe clinic caters to premium needs, from snacks elaborated by world-famous chef Alain Ducasse to a balneotherapy section modelled on ‘Japanese thermal baths‘, featuring a snow cabin (?) and a mineral bath that is, I am told, “twice as salty as the Dead Sea”.\n\nAttali tells me that in the long-term, Zoī hopes to become accessible to everyone, and that prices will go down to a similar level to your average WiFi subscription.\n\nFor now, though, preventative health remains a hobby of the upper-class. In fact, Zoī's investors are all private individuals; the company’s €20m seed round, which it raised in 2022, included a good number of high-profile billionaires such as Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saadé and Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel.\n\nAnd Zoī is not the only longevity startup appealing to the ultra-rich. Spotify founder Daniel Ek is behind similar ventures, including [Sand Clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-ek-spotify-sand-clinic-longevity-news), where customers can receive full body check-ups and treatments ranging from vacuum therapy to red light saunas — with membership expected to cost between €1,000 and €10,000 a month.\n\nEk is also the founder of healthtech Neko Health, which has built a full-body scanner for health data collection that it says helps doctors detect potential diseases earlier. The company [has a clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/ek-neko-body-scanner-test) and has just opened a new spot in London, right in the middle of Marylebone, where it prices a one-hour scan at £299 — almost double the price of a visit to the Stockholm clinic when it opened in 2023 (€180).\n\nDespite the cost, the proposition seems appealing enough. Neko Health says it already has a waiting list of 22k people; Zoī says it has “around 1k members” to date and is currently carrying out a dozen check-ups per day — but the startup is confident that it can ramp up to reach its maximum capacity of 35k annual check-ups in the next five years.\n\nWhether or not the preventative treatments promised by startups like Zoī, Neko Health and Sand Clinic will ever reach the masses remains to be seen; what seems certain for now is that billionaires won’t get tired of full-body-scanning anytime soon.\n\n![Image 1: A photo of the entrance to Zoï's centre in Paris](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/06145636/Zoi%CC%84_WIP6_%C2%A911h45-HD-4.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThe entrance to Zoï's centre in Paris.

It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nDoccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE).\n\nDoccla’s founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.\n\n“With the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it’s a huge opportunity to scale,” says Ratz.\n\nThe virtual A&E\n\nSweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.\n\nAccording to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.\n\nPatients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.\n\nSo far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it’s adding 1k new patients every month.\n\n“Over time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,” Ratz says.\n\nPartnering with pharma\n\nDoccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).\n\n“We have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,” Ratz says. “This is because we are in very close contact with our patients.”\n\nDoccla says it’s interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he’s seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.\n\nWith 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.\n\nIn one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.\n\n“We can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits — in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,” Ratz says.\n\nDoccla has raised a total of £52m to date.\n\nIn October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.", 'gpt-4o-mini']

In 2023, startups in the sector raised $2.2bn with 2024 looking similar — roughly half of the $4bn picked up in 2021, according to Sifted data.\n\nBut there have still been some sizable rounds in recent times. Since the start of 2023, surgical robotics startups have been the biggest winners. The UK’s CMR Surgical picked up £165m in September last year, Switzerland’s DistalMotion $150m in April 2023 and Italy’s Medical Microinstruments $110m in February this year.\n\nThere’s also been some buzz around next-gen diagnostic devices, as founders — including Spotify’s Daniel Ek with his body scanning startup Neko Health — look to tap into the trend of more people using wellbeing and fitness devices like Apple Watches and Oura rings.\n\nBut which non-portfolio medtech startups are investors keeping a close eye on? To find out, Sifted spoke to VCs at 415 Capital, Sofinnova Partners, MIG Capital and SHS Capital.\n\n### **Linus Rieder, principal at 415 Capital**\n\n#### **Medical Microinstruments (MMI) – Italy**\n\nMMI is building surgical robots to help with micro-surgery. Its robotics platform can be used in reconstructive surgery, plastic surgery and head-neck surgery. The startup is looking to solve key issues in microsurgery like the effects of surgeon tremor and reduces the need for microsurgery training.\n\n#### **Gradient Denervation Technologies — France**\n\nGradient Denervation Technologies is developing a device for treating heart failure patients with associated pulmonary hypertension. As many as half of heart failure patients around the world have elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, which is shown to lead to an increased risk of mortality and hospitalisation. There are no approved drug or device therapies for this group of pulmonary hypertension patients. By using minimally invasive ultrasound to treat hyperactive nerves in the pulmonary arteries, however, the startup’s technology has the potential to treat and help tens of thousands of patients each year.\n\n#### **CorWave — France**\n\nCorWave's left ventricular assist device (LVAD) mimics the natural heart's function to treat patients with advanced heart failure. This technology enables the device to replicate the heart pulses, reducing the mechanical damage to blood cells common with current LVADs.\n\n### **Anne Osdoit, partner at Sofinnova Partners**\n\n#### **Ganymed Robotics — France** \n\nGanymed is working on a robotics platform to assist surgeons with implant placement during knee replacement surgery. The Paris-based company's approach uses computer vision and artificial intelligence to perceive, and extract knowledge from, the surgical environment in a non-invasive manner, removing imaging and registration steps that add time and complexity to knee surgery.\n\n#### **Gleamer — France**\n\nGleamer is developing AI tools to enhance image interpretation for radiologists. The startup’s main product helps clinicians identify bone trauma at the point of care. Gleamer has achieved multiple regulatory approvals and successfully commercially deployed in both the US and EU.\n\n#### **Salvia BioElectronics — The Netherlands** \n\nSalvia BioElectronics is developing drug-free neuromodulation therapies — which refers to a group of medical procedures that look to change brain activity by stimulating nerves — for migraines. Salvia's paper-thin implant is designed to be placed under the forehead to reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks by delivering gentle electrical pulses to the nerves associated with the condition. The company is currently in the clinical stage, having received the Breakthrough Device Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which facilitates expedited market access for devices that treat life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating conditions.\n\n### **Fei Tian, principal at MIG Capital**\n\n#### **Artidis — Switzerland**\n\nArtidis is developing imaging tools for cancer diagnostics. It combines a nanotechnology device which analyses tissue with a digital data platform to measure the physical characteristics of both tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment. After determining if a tumour is benign or malignant, Artidis’ technology identifies if it will spread to other sites and can help inform chemotherapy and immunotherapy permeability and treatment response.\n\n#### **CoreMedic — Switzerland**\n\nCoreMedic has developed an implant which treats the heart condition mitral valve regurgitation (MR). The CoreMedic implant can replace ruptured mitral — a part of the heart — in a minimally invasive procedure that is physiological and reproducible, promising long-term clinical benefits.\n\n### **Cornelius Maas, partner at SHS Capital**\n\n#### **Vitestro — The Netherlands**\n\nVitestro is developing an autonomous blood drawing device. This innovative device combines robotics and AI to perform blood drawing more efficiently and safely. Over the past year, Vitestro has made significant strides in clinical trials and secured an additional €20m in funding in April. Vitestro’s tool could mean less burden for patients, less work for the medical staff and consequently reduce costs for the healthcare system.\n\n#### **Saphenus — Austria**\n\nSaphenus is developing sensory feedback systems for prosthetics. Their key product, the Suralis system, provides users of lower-limb prosthetics with the sensation of foot contact, significantly improving balance and gait. Recently, Saphenus received FDA approval with their Suralis system and received reimbursement status with key German medical insurers.\n\n#### **Bluedrop Medical — Ireland**\n\nBluedrop Medical is developing a medical device to monitor foot health and prevent diabetic foot ulcers. It looks like a weighing scale and aims to enable early detection of foot ulcers, which can lead to amputation. Bluedrop Medical is a good example of how remote monitoring can replace doctor visits while preventing serious disease progression, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.", 'gpt-4o-mini']

It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.\n\n“For us [GLP-1 drugs] are already a strong growth driver,” he says. “The newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.”\n\nWhile treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva’s overall business — Eberhardt says it’s growing total patient and revenue numbers by “double digit” percentage points year-on-year — the meds could become the startup’s “largest” growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.\n\n### Riding the wave\n\nOviva’s not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity — many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.\n\nIn the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart’s CEO, food sales have fallen as the one in eight adults in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe’s most valuable company, propping up Denmark’s GDP in the process.\n\nAll of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have convinced them to get out their chequebook: Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a €10m Series A in August 2023 a year on from a €3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised €3.1m last summer.\n\nMany startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn’t start life offering them — largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.\n\nUK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a “men’s health” brand, but has recently changed that. The company’s website uses images of men and women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.\n\nYazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.\n\nMeurling tells Sifted it had hit €14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It’s now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.\n\nOther startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men’s sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.\n\n“[GLP-1 meds] are a game changer,” says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be “strange” if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn’t looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.\n\nWhile GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the “hype” surrounding the drug class has “opened doors” for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler — adding that the startup managed to raise its €400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It’s now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it’ll look to target US employers — who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.\n\n### Kinks in the supply chain\n\nThere are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector — not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.\n\nSome of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate’s $100m in 2021 and Form Health’s $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than €10m in a single round.\n\nInvestors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics — Manual was still selling past the deadline.\n\nIf a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.\n\n“As there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.”\n\n### Who’ll stump up the cash?\n\nThere’s also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.\n\nWhile Numan’s head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the “success of private sector companies offering GLP-1 [drugs] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS”, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won’t be enough to hit real scale.\n\n“US investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts [selling to whole organisations like health insurers],” says Syhler. “This means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care — where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.”\n\nIn Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.\n\nIn the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.\n\nOviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS — but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it’s in “mature dialogues with several health systems”.\n\n“It is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,” says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that don’t always want to work with startups. Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.\n\nWhether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen — but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. “I've never been an investor in a company that’s got so much attention — in a space that’s got so much attention,” says Arnardottir.", 'gpt-4o-mini']

The net monetary benefit of introducing the optimal regimen ranged from approximately £60.4 million (US $77.3 million) to £85.3 million (US $109.2 million).\n\n**Meaning** These results suggest that AI-based risk stratified breast cancer screening programs may be more cost-effective screening programs, providing additional health benefits with fewer resources than universal screening intervals for all.\n\n**Importance** Previous research has shown good discrimination of short-term risk using an artificial intelligence (AI) risk prediction model (Mirai). However, no studies have been undertaken to evaluate whether this might translate into economic gains.\n\n**Objective** To assess the cost-effectiveness of incorporating risk-stratified screening using a breast cancer AI model into the United Kingdom (UK) National Breast Cancer Screening Program.\n\n**Design, Setting, and Participants** This study, conducted from January 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024, involved the development of a decision analytical model to estimate health-related quality of life, cancer survival rates, and costs over the lifetime of the female population eligible for screening. The analysis took a UK payer perspective, and the simulated cohort consisted of women aged 50 to 70 years at screening.\n\n**Exposures** Mammography screening at 1 to 6 yearly screening intervals based on breast cancer risk and standard care (screening every 3 years).\n\n**Main Outcomes and Measures** Incremental net monetary benefit based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and National Health Service (NHS) costs (given in pounds sterling; to convert to US dollars, multiply by 1.28).\n\n**Results** Artificial intelligence–based risk-stratified programs were estimated to be cost-saving and increase QALYs compared with the current screening program. A screening schedule of every 6 years for lowest-risk individuals, biannually and triennially for those below and above average risk, respectively, and annually for those at highest risk was estimated to give yearly net monetary benefits within the NHS of approximately £60.4 (US $77.3) million and £85.3 (US $109.2) million, with QALY values set at £20\u202f000 (US $25\u202f600) and £30\u202f000 (US $38\u202f400), respectively. Even in scenarios where decision-makers hesitate to allocate additional NHS resources toward screening, implementing the proposed strategies at a QALY value of £1 (US $1.28) was estimated to generate a yearly monetary benefit of approximately £10.6 (US $13.6) million.\n\n**Conclusions and Relevance** In this decision analytical model study of integrating risk-stratified screening with a breast cancer AI model into the UK National Breast Cancer Screening Program, risk-stratified screening was likely to be cost-effective, yielding added health benefits at reduced costs. These results are particularly relevant for health care settings where resources are under pressure. New studies to prospectively evaluate AI-guided screening appear warranted.\n\nEarly detection of breast cancer is a top priority for the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS). The NHS largely uses an age-based screening strategy, inviting women aged 50 to 70 years for mammography screening triennially; most other countries with a breast screening program adopt a biennial program. This one-size-fits-all approach might be improved by tailoring screening so that those at highest risk receive the greatest intensity of screening (risk-based screening).\n\nThe NHS is considering the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into mammogram interpretation for breast screening in the future. AI is currently not used in NHS breast screening appointments in the UK due to a lack of high-quality prospective studies, but emerging prospective data are promising.\n\nIn parallel with AI for cancer detection, AI for risk prediction has been proposed. One such model (Mirai) interprets data automatically generated from mammogram screenings, without the need for data collection through questionnaires. The AI model offers an immediate estimation of an individual’s short-term risk of cancer incidence following a mammogram with negative findings. The AI model is open source and freely available for research and is arguably the best (retrospectively) validated AI model for short-term breast cancer risk assessment. One analysis included an external validation across 7 hospitals spanning 3 continents, and overall, evidence suggests that in the short term, it attains a higher area under the receiving operating characteristics curve than classical risk models or breast density.\n\nWhile the performance of the AI model for risk assessment is highly promising, one area that has not been rigorously evaluated is whether using the model to guide screening could offer value for money. Our aim was therefore to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of integrating risk-stratified screening using the model into the UK National Breast Cancer Screening Program, through a health economic model. We considered risk-based screening strategies that would be expected to require the same number of screens as the current triennial program, assuming perfect adherence. In practice, strategies that involve extended screening intervals for a larger proportion of the population than those who receive more frequent screening might require fewer screens overall.\n\nSpecific risk-stratified breast cancer screening regimens (RSBCRs), determined by risk thresholds, were based on recent work that used a simplified deterministic model to evaluate potential effectiveness. These RSBCRs involve screening intervals aligned with corresponding risk thresholds tailored for the AI model chosen for this research. In this report, we developed an economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 4 AI-based screening strategies in comparison with the current screening program. The economic model was then used to estimate health-related quality of life, survival, and NHS costs over the lifetime of the female population eligible for screening in the UK. Results from our analysis might inform future prospective evaluations of AI-guided screening.\n\nThis study was conducted from January 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024. We followed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) reporting guideline and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence methods of technology appraisal manual. We developed a discrete event simulation model in R, version 4.2.2, using the simmer’ package (R Project for Statistical Computing) to accommodate individual attributes that evolve over time within the simulation such as breast cancer risk. The work was funded by Cancer Research UK and the policy research unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions. Because the data are drawn from publicly available sources, ethics approval is not required for decision modeling in the UK.\n\nThe following 4 strategies were distinguished by screening intervals in years for groups categorized by a 3-year risk score (RS):\n\n1. One year (RS, ≥2.57%), 2 years (RS, 1.32%-2.57%), 3 years (RS, 1.22%-1.32%), or 6 years (RS, ≤1.22%)\n2. One year (RS, ≥2.72%), 3 years (RS, 1.23%-2.72%), or 6 years (RS, ≤1.23%)\n3. Two years (RS, ≥2.79%), 3 years (RS, 1.35%-2.79%), or 6 years (RS, ≤1.35%)\n4. One year (RS, ≥2.20%), 3 years (RS, 1.23%-2.20%), or 4 years (RS, ≤1.23%).\n\nThe model focused on 5 dynamic processes: (1) Women transition between risk groups based on screen attendance and AI-model–assessed risk scores. (2) Mammogram accuracy is based on breast density, which changes as women age. (3) Attendance patterns to screening appointments are influenced by age and attendance history. (4) Attendance history and time intervals between screenings impact cancer stage. (5) Cancer prognosis is influenced by age, where it was identified (at regular screening or not), and attendance history, with worse outcomes for women who have not attended breast screenings.\n\nStructure and Model Events\n\n[Figure 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#zoi240951f1) depicts the model structure, illustrating the sequence of clinical events and potential pathways from initiation to screening, cancer detection, and mortality. Women enter the model at the first screening invitation at 50 years of age, with subsequent invitations occurring at regular intervals until 70 years of age. Each screening appointment includes an updated AI risk assessment, determining the timing of the next screen invitation. If a woman misses her initial screening, invitations are sent every 3 years thereafter. The model ends when individuals reach cancer-related mortality or mortality from all other causes.\n\nAt entry, women are assigned predetermined ages of noncancer mortality and have a chance of developing breast cancer up to 74 years of age, sourced from Office for National Statistics life expectancy tables (2018-2020) and NHS breast cancer registry data. The age at which symptomatic cancer is detected in a primary care setting is sampled from 2020 incidence data, adjusted for age-related lead time in the UK screening program using overdiagnosis estimates. Screening may identify cancer at an earlier age than this determined age of symptomatic cancer. Data on attendance from 2018 to 2019, stratified by age and screening history, were used to calculate attendance probability to a screening invitation. The NHS incurs a cost of £14.52 (US $18.59) for each screening invitation (details of screening costs are in eTable 2 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1)). Screening invitations end at 70 years of age or the nearest subsequent year if screening is not scheduled at 70 years of age. For instance, in simulating the current program with screenings every 3 years, a woman attending screening at 68 years of age would receive her last invitation at 71 years of age, after which any developing cancers would be detected symptomatically.\n\nModel Event: Screening Appointment\n\nAttending women undergo a mammogram; if cancer is detected, further assessments are conducted. Breast density and AI model scores are from UK women aged 46 to 74 years and applied based on age and cancer presence. Details are available in eMethods 1 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1).\n\nIn the model, a woman’s age for potential tumor detection is set before her first screening and remains constant throughout her life. Screening detection ages are calculated by subtracting the tumor presence period from the age at which symptomatic cancer is detected. The tumor presence period is derived from national breast screening program data and is based on age, with mean durations ranging from approximately 6 years at 35 years of age to 8 years at 85 years of age.\n\nEach mammography session has a cost of £54.32 (US $69.53) and results in a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss of 0.0014 due to associated discomfort. A summary table of the diagnostic accuracy of mammography is presented in eTable 1 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1). Sensitivity estimates are sourced from recent estimates in a population-based screening program and vary based on breast density, ranging from 62% (dense) to 90% (not dense). False-positive results occur when no underlying tumor is present during a screening, with chances ranging from 1.5% (not dense) to 2.9% (dense), and they cause a QALY loss of 0.0771. Mammographic results indicating cancer leads to further assessments, which verify whether the cancer is present, and involve mammography, ultrasonography, and biopsy totaling £484.90 (US $620.67). Detailed breakdowns of mammography’s diagnostic accuracy, screening and further assessment costs, and screen-related QALY losses are found in eTables 2 and 3 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1).\n\nModel Event: Interval Between Screening Appointments\n\nBetween screening appointments, cancers are detected immediately in primary care on reaching the age of symptomatic detection, with the primary care appointment costing £37.00 (US $47.36), and further assessment totaling £484.90 (US $620.67) NHS cost. Mortality due to other causes than breast cancer can occur and aging results in a health utility loss based on a published formula.\n\nModel Event: Cancer Treatment and Survival\n\nAfter cancer detection, cancer is classified as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive tumor TNM stages I to IV, determined by age and mode of detection (at a screening appointment or symptomatically in primary care) using UK population screening data. The stage distribution is adjusted based on the time since the last screen, using US data comparing stage distribution by screening frequency. Detailed methodology and sources can be found in Hill et al.\n\nTreatment-related health losses and NHS costs vary by age, stage, mode of detection (screen or symptomatic), and time since detection (for follow-up costs and health recovery). Health utility losses after cancer are taken from multivariate regression, using the utility decrements on age, stage, and mode of detection. Recovery times are 11 years for screen-detected and interval cancers and 12 years for symptomatic cancers, based on peak health-related quality of life values post cancer detection. Stage 4 cancers are assumed to show no improvement in quality of life.\n\nCancer survival estimates come from Office for National Statistics mortality statistics and multivariable regressions. Mortality hazard ratios by stage and detection mode are applied to age-based mortality to determine life expectancy. Cancer treatment-related utility losses, costs, and survival estimates are available in eTables 4 to 6 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1).\n\nEconomic and Clinical Outcomes\n\nCosts were assessed from a UK payer perspective and reported in 2022 pounds sterling. Quality-adjusted life-years and costs were discounted at 3.5%. The main economic outcome is incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) per woman, which quantifies in monetary terms the net benefit of interventions by reflecting the potential alternative use of intervention resources for other health care treatments. Incremental net monetary benefit is established from differences in patient costs, and from assigning a monetary value to the difference in QALYs, which we assume to be £20 000 (US $25 600), £30 000 (US $38 400), and £1 (US $1.28) per QALY. The latter represents a scenario where a decision-maker is reluctant to spend additional NHS resources to increase population health. Population-wide INMB is derived by multiplying the per-woman INMB by the population size of women at 50 years of age eligible for screening invitations, which is 174\u202f523, sourced from the 2022 national breast screening program data. Clinical outcomes include tumor stage at detection, cancers detected during screening, breast cancer deaths prevented by RSBCRs in the population (174\u202f523 women), and the number of screens conducted.\n\nAll analyses were performed using R, version 4.2.2 (R Program for Statistical Computing). We conducted external validation of the model against targets derived from the 2022 national breast screening program data. To identify where savings occur, cost results are divided into screening-related costs and those for treating DCIS and invasive cancers. Cancer treatment costs are broken down by stage (DCIS, stages I-II, and stages III-IV) and mode of detection (screen-detected and interval cancers). Deterministic sensitivity analysis is conducted by adjusting the cancer treatment and screening costs, health-related quality of life losses from cancer and screening, and mammography sensitivity. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is performed using 250 Monte Carlo simulations using probabilistic sensitivity analysis parameter distributions reported in eTable 8 in [Supplement 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#note-ZOI240951-1). The probability that each RSBCR is cost-effective is illustrated on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Population-wide INMB estimates from the 250 Monte Carlo simulations are calculated across cost per QALY values ranging from £1 (US $1.28) to £100 000 (US $128 000).\n\n[Table 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#zoi240951t1) shows base-case economic results and the annual impact of the economic results in the entire population. All the AI-based regimens were associated with reduced NHS costs and increased QALYs compared with the current screening program. The strategy of conducting screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk had the highest additional net monetary gain per woman invited for screening. This amounts to £346 (US $442.88) and £489 (US $625.92) under the assumption of QALY values being £20\u202f000 (US $25 600) and £30 000 (US $38 400), respectively. Consequently, this leads to an annual net monetary benefit within the NHS screening program totaling £10.6 million (US $13.6 million) for QALY values of £1, £60.4 million (US $77.3 million) for QALY values of £20 000, and £85.3 million (US $109.2 million) for QALY values of £30 000. The 3 alternative approaches had comparable figures for the net monetary benefit gained. For instance, the screening strategy of 6 yearly, triannual, and biannual screening has the smallest incremental net monetary benefit, amounting to £188 (US $240.64) and £236 (US $302.08) per person, assuming QALY values of £20 000 and £30 000, respectively. This resulted in an annual population incremental net benefit of £32.7 million (US $41.9 million), assuming £20 000 per QALY and £41.2 million (US $52.7 million), assuming £30 000 per QALY.\n\n[Table 2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715?guestAccessKey=5fccf768-e956-418c-863e-a26f2d537653#zoi240951t2) shows the clinical and screening program results. The clinical outcomes of all regimens showed an improvement compared with the current screening program. Compared with the current screening program, conducting screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk resulted in a higher number of screen-detected cancers (10\u202f549 vs 8943), a greater percentage of DCIS cancers at detection (17.1% vs 13.6%), a reduction in the number of screens (mean [SD], 3.22 [0.02] vs 4.68 [0.05]), and prevention of 834 deaths due to breast cancer.\n\nDeterministic Sensitivity Analysis Results\n\nThe deterministic sensitivity analysis results align with the cost-effectiveness of screening regimens found in the base-case model. Screening every 6 years for low risk, every 2 to 3 years for medium risk, and annually for high risk was likely to be most beneficial. Risk-stratified breast cancer screening regimens maintained their cost-effectiveness compared with the current program and each other. The breakdown of NHS costs incurred by women shows screening costs are lower in the RSBCR than in the current program. Cancer treatment costs incurred are larger for RSBCRs due to life extension for patients with cancer from increased screen detection of cancers and early cancer detection.\n\nProbabilistic Sensitivity Analysis Results\n\nThe probabilistic sensitivity analysis results demonstrate an improvement in the cost-effectiveness of screening regimens compared with the base-case model, without a shift in the ranking of programs from most to least cost-effective. The regimen with screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, or 6 years had the highest probability of being cost-effective (59% at £20\u202f000 [US $25 600] per QALY) and had the largest net monetary benefit for all cost per QALY thresholds. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve shows the regimen of 2, 3, or 6 years was likely to be the least cost-effective alternative option for RSBCRs, and the current screening program has a negligible probability of being cost-effective across all cost per QALY thresholds.\n\nUnder our analytic model, AI-based risk-stratified screening is likely to be cost-effective compared with the current one-size-fits-all screening program. Our findings are consistent with previous modeling studies demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of risk-stratified screening, whether based on traditional risk factors like family history or newer methods such as polygenic risk scores. However, our model is the first to suggest that health care resources might be reduced with RSBCRs, while attaining at least the same effectiveness for the population. This study is also the first to assess the cost-effectiveness of AI interpretation of breast images for risk assessment during routine screening. This might be more feasible at scale than the other risk assessment methods.\n\nWhile the estimated incremental economic benefits per individual invited to breast screening may seem modest in the base-case model, ranging from £188 (US $240.64) to £346 (US $442.88), the annual monetary gains for the NHS might be substantial, estimated to range from £32.7 million (US $ 41.9 million) to £60.4 million (US $77.3 million). In the probabilistic model, these savings are around 3 times larger. The health economic model suggests that RSBCRs can reduce screening utilization, NHS costs, and invasive cancer in the population and increase QALYs. The reduction in the number of screenings with an RSBCR could free up resources to address screening backlogs and reduce wait times where those problems exist in the UK, potentially further improving breast cancer outcomes.\n\nAnnual screening RSBCRs lead to higher percentages of screen-detected cancers and greater percentages of DCIS cancers at detection, along with higher QALYs. However, biennial screening for the highest-risk group, with corresponding 3 and 6 yearly screening for other risk groups, incurs lower costs due to fewer screenings. Screen utilization is not the only explanation of the difference in cost-effectiveness among the regimens. Other contributing factors are the proportion of individuals at medium and high risk within the population undergoing intensified screening surveillance, their uptake to screening appointments, and the accuracy of mammography in women with denser breast tissue that makes cancers harder to detect. Although cost-effectiveness is important, it is not the only factor to consider when comparing the benefits of the regimen. For example, a population accustomed to the UK’s triennial screening program may view a 6-year gap between screenings as unacceptable, favoring a 4-year interval instead. This change to an RSBCR screening program with a 4-year screening interval for patients at low risk would generate an annual monetary benefit of £50 million (US $64 million), assuming a QALY is valued at £20 000 (US $25 600). Significant variations in screening frequency within programs can be accepted by patients. In the UK, colonoscopy surveillance guidelines for cancer vary by risk level, with no surveillance for patients at low risk, every 3 years for patients at intermediate risk, and annually for patients at high risk.\n\nThis study has some limitations. First, the model is parametrized for the UK. Findings may not be directly generalizable to alternative geographical populations, such as the US or elsewhere in Europe. Clinical guidelines in these regions often recommend universal annual or biennial screening, while a triennial screening program is in place in the UK, and typically screening also begins at earlier ages in these regions. Therefore, the comparator screen detection rates based on triennial screening, on which the model depends, are likely to differ across populations with varied screening frequencies and onset ages. For example, in a setting where annual screening is the norm, all the regimens considered would reduce costs but also effectiveness. Further analysis using the model could usefully contribute to decisions on the economic value of decreasing intensity of screening based on breast cancer AI in such settings.\n\nIn this decision analytical model study of risk-based screening with AI-based risk assessment, risk-based screening delivered health benefits while using fewer NHS resources compared with the current UK breast screening program. New studies to prospectively evaluate AI-guided screening appear warranted.\n\nArticle Information\n\n**Accepted for Publication:** July 10, 2024.\n\n**Published:** September 5, 2024. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.31715\n\n**Open Access:** This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. © 2024 Hill H et al. _JAMA Network Open_.\n\n**Corresponding Author:** Harry Hill, PhD, School of Medicine and Population Health, Regent Court, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S1 4 DA, United Kingdom (harry.hill@sheffield.ac.uk).\n\n**Author Contributions:** Dr Hill had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\n\n_Concept and design:_ Hill, Roadevin, Duffy, Brentnall.\n\n_Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:_ All authors.\n\n_Drafting of the manuscript:_ Hill, Roadevin.\n\n_Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:_ Hill, Duffy, Mandrik, Brentnall.\n\n_Statistical analysis:_ All authors.\n\n_Obtained funding:_ Hill, Brentnall.\n\n_Administrative, technical, or material support:_ Hill, Roadevin.\n\n_Supervision:_ Hill, Duffy.\n\n**Conflict of Interest Disclosures:** Dr Brentnall reported receiving royalties from Cancer Research UK arising from commercial use of the Tyrer-Cuzick breast cancer risk evaluation tool (IBIS) outside the submitted work.

If found to be safe and effective in people, a once-monthly formulation could improve patient adherence and quality of life of those with type 2 diabetes or obesity.\n\n**METHODOLOGY:**\n----------------\n\n*   About half or more patients taking semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist approved for treating obesity with or without type 2 diabetes, may discontinue treatment with their once-weekly subcutaneous injections or daily oral pills at 12 months, but longer-acting formulations may increase drug efficacy and patient adherence.\n*   Researchers have developed two versions of an injectable semaglutide-loaded hydrogel mixed with a pair of degradable polymers that chemically bond together.\n*   After injection, the formulations form either a gel disk or microgel suspension that enables a gradual and prolonged drug release.\n*   To identify the optimal formulation, researchers analyzed the hydrogel compositions in vitro to study drug release kinetics, duration of effectiveness, and semaglutide loading content.\n*   The experimental semaglutide-loaded hydrogel disk or microgel particles were injected subcutaneously in six wild-type Wistar Han male rats of normal weight (250-300 g) to characterize semaglutide pharmacokinetics and hydrogel biocompatibility.\n\n**TAKEAWAY:**\n-------------\n\n*   The formulation could be easily injected using a 25G needle, with gelation starting within minutes of mixing.\n*   In both versions, a single injection of the hydrogel-based formulations in rats demonstrated a minimal initial early release, followed by a consistent release over the course of 1 month.\n*   The product was well tolerated with no edema or inflammatory reaction during the treatment period.\n*   The hydrogel could be easily degraded by enzymes in in vitro studies.\n\n**IN PRACTICE:**\n----------------\n\n"A small dollop of gel, known as a \'depot,\' of the semaglutide-laden hydrogel is injected under the skin," said Claire Mégret, PhD, lead author of the poster presentation, in a news release. "Our pre-clinical results demonstrate that the regular, slow release of semaglutide over one month after administering a single dose, with limited early release, is achievable," she added.\n\n**SOURCE:**\n-----------\n\nThis study was led by Audrey Marechal, Adocia, Lyon, France, and was published online on September 8, 2024, as a poster [abstract](https://www.easd.org/media-centre/home.html#!resources/b-development-of-a-once-a-month-formulation-of-semaglutide-from-an-innovative-injectable-and-biodegradable-hydrogel-b-3a26d010-e0a3-4d7f-99a3-eff96220f163) 746 at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Madrid, Spain.\n\n**LIMITATIONS:**\n----------------\n\nNo limitations were discussed.\n\n**DISCLOSURES:**\n----------------\n\nThis study was funded by Adocia.

This year, PCWHF speaker sessions will have a primary-care relevant, practical focus, underpinned by realistic case studies to illustrate the application of guidelines in the real world.\n\nPublished in 2022, the _Women’s Health Strategy for England_ notes that there is not enough focus on women-specific issues such as menopause. Over the past few years, healthcare professionals have faced challenges such as shortages of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT), a lack of licensed options for testosterone as part of HRT, and funding for the fitting of intrauterine devices and implants that may not cover the costs of the procedure.\n\nIn the first of the PCWHF speaker sessions on Day 1, **Dr Julie Oliver**, PCWHF Chair, will discuss the recent British Menopause Society guideline on the management of unscheduled bleeding in women taking HRT. The guideline provides a new approach to risk stratification, and includes a helpful one-page summary flowchart to guide management. It also answers the perennial question ‘_How high is too high?_’—that is, what is the oestrogen dose needed to increase the amount of progestogen in an HRT regime? Dr Oliver is an NHS GP in County Durham, with an extended role in women’s health and a long history of speaking at conferences such as _Guidelines Live_.\n\nOn the Day 2 of _Guidelines Live_ 2024, **Dr Caroline Cooper** will give a contraception update, with a focus on new guidance. Dr Cooper will explore contraceptive options for women over 40 years of age, emphasising safety, efficacy, and individualised care approaches. Dr Cooper is an experienced GP with an extended role in women’s health. She is also a faculty-registered trainer, and has served on the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare committees, as well as being a current director of the PCWHF.\n\nNext, **Dr Angela Wright** will continue the HRT theme, but adding relevance to younger women, by discussing testosterone and libido. Informed by her experience of primary and secondary care NHS work, Dr Wright’s speaker session will explain how those in primary care can support women who have complex menopause issues, sexual dysfunction, and premenstrual disorders. Dr Wright is a fellow of the European Committee of Sexual Medicine, and an active committee member of the British Society of Sexual Medicine.\n\n### The Primary Care Women’s Health Forum\n\nThese _Guidelines Live_ sessions are supported by the Primary Care Women’s Health Forum (PCWHF), a group of 10,000 healthcare professionals with a special interest in women’s health. The PCWHF aims to promote and progress standards in women’s health in primary care through education, resources, and events, and lobbies on behalf of its members to determine future strategic direction and policymaking for women’s health.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormality ranks at 3 months were significantly lower in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups compared with the olanzapine group (all _P_\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, the Glx/Cr ratio significantly decreased after 3 months of treatment (all _P_\u2009<\u20090.05) in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups, while the Glx/Cr ratio in the olanzapine group showed no significant change (_P_\u2009>\u20090.05).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCompared with olanzapine, the addition of magnesium valproate or lamotrigine to immunotherapy might be associated with a lower PANSS score, higher MoCA score, and lower mRS score. The improvement of neurological functions and cognitive function may be related to the decreased Glx/Cr ratio.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nAnti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a rare autoimmune encephalitis with acute onset neuropsychiatric symptoms due to an autoimmune reaction to the glutamate N receptor (GluN1) subunit of the neuronal NMDAR. The reported annual incidence is about 1.5 per million persons-year. Currently, the recommended treatment for anti-NMDAR encephalitis is the use of first-line immunotherapy that includes glucocorticoids, γ-globulin, plasma exchange, tumor resection, acyclovir (until a viral etiology is ruled out), and symptomatic support. Still, only about 53% of patients appear to respond well to first-line immunotherapy, with a fairly high recurrence rate. Pathogenically, the autoantibody binds to the extracellular domain of the GluN1 subunit, resulting in NMDAR internalization and glutamatergic hypofunction. The first-line immunotherapies appear to intervene at the antigen/antibody reaction stage, which might underscore the limited effectiveness of this treatment strategy in the context of potentially broader pathophysiological alterations in the brain.\n\nGiven the existence of glutamatergic hypofunction in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, it can be hypothesized that an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission should be present in the brain, contributing to the pathophysiology of the disease. Accordingly, adjuvant therapies that help mitigate this imbalance could be beneficial in the clinical management of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. A case report suggested using adjuvant memantine to manage catatonia in anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Ketamine can also be used in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and refractory persistent epilepsy. Intrathecal methotrexate has been suggested for refractory anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Still, few data are available regarding adjuvant therapies in anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\n\nTherefore, this retrospective study aimed to compare the cognitive and neurological functions of three adjuvant drugs in treating anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and to establish a relationship between these improvements and the balance in neuronal excitation and inhibition through glutamate (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Based on this study, we hypothesized that the effects of three adjunctive therapeutics in the treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis were determined by relating their clinical efficacy for the improvement of cognitive and neurological functions to their extent of pharmacological modulation of glutamate (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission in the cerebrum.\n\nMaterials and methods\n---------------------\n\n### Study design and patients\n\nThis retrospective study collected the clinical data of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis admitted to Hunan Brain Hospital between January 2018 and December 2020. All included patients received standard immunotherapy and different adjuvant treatments. The patients were then grouped based on the adjuvant medications they received.\n\nThe study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Hunan Brain Hospital (approval #2018K065). The requirement for informed consent was waived by the committee because of the retrospective nature of the study. All data were anonymized after extraction and before analysis.\n\n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n\nClinical cases meeting the diagnostic criteria for anti-NMDAR encephalitis according to clinical guidelines. The exclusion criteria included encephalitis with other causes, tumors found, seizures as the first symptom, and incomplete clinical data.\n\n### Drug administration\n\nAll patients receive standardized first-line immunotherapy after admission, including intravenous immunoglobulin injection (According to the patient’s weight, a total of 2 g/kg should be administered intravenously for three to five days.), plasma exchange (with a dose of 1.0 to 1.5 times the total plasma volume, performed 3–6 exchanges within 10–14 days.), glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 1000 mg/d for 3 consecutive days, 500 mg/d for 3 consecutive days, followed by a reduction of 40-80 mg/d.). According to the 2017 Consensus of Chinese Experts on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Autoimmune Encephalitis, doctors choose different drugs for adjuvant treatment based on the different clinical symptoms of patients.\n\n### Outcomes and data collection\n\nThe primary outcome was improving the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). As per routine practice, all patients underwent assessments using the PANSS, the MoCA, and the mRS before initiating any treatment. The PANSS and the MoCA were conducted at 3 weeks and 3 months after the initial treatments. The mRS were assessed at 3 months after the start of treatments. The PANSS quantifies positive symptoms (which refer to excess or distortion of normal functions, e.g., hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (which represent a diminution or loss of normal functions) and is widely used in the study of psychopharmacologic therapy. Each subscale is scored 1–7 points ranging from absent to extreme. The range for the positive and negative scales is 7–49, and the range for the general psychopathology scale is 16–112. The MoCA is a test used to detect mild cognitive decline and early signs of dementia. It contains 11 tests in eight cognitive areas: attention and concentration, executive function, memory, language, visual structure skills, abstract thinking, computation, and orientation. The total score is 30, and _≥_\u200926 is considered normal. The mRS is originally developed to evaluate the state of neurological recovery in patients after stroke, and it has been extended used to various neurological conditions, including autoimmune encephalitis. The mRS scores are categorized as follows: 0: no symptoms; 1: no significant disability and able to carry out all usual activities; 2: slight disability; 3: moderate disability; 4: moderately severe disability; 5: severe disability; 6: death. Generally, mRS scores of 0–1 indicate a good functional prognosis. The above experimental scales were evaluated by two residents of the psychiatric department of this hospital.\n\nThe secondary outcomes were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and antibody titer changes. The above experimental scales were evaluated by two Imaging doctors and electroencephalography doctors.\n\nAll patients underwent EEG assessments before initiating any treatment, as well as at 3 weeks and 3 months after the start of the treatments. The EEGs were rated as normal, mild, moderate, or severe. The EEG records from the patients were scored as the frequency (n) of “normal and mild background abnormalities (No\u2009+\u2009Mi)” or “moderate background and severe background abnormalities (Mo\u2009+\u2009Se)”. The improvement rate of EEG was defined as (No\u2009+\u2009Mi)/total number of patients ×100%. The patients underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) before treatment and 3 months after treatment. The powers of the neurotransmitters Glu and GABA were determined by brain fluctuation mapping, with the Glx/Cr index measured at the top of the left frontal lobe in each patient. The reference powers of Glu and GABA in the brain were determined by Shenzhen Kangli High Tech Co., Ltd. after testing 10,000 healthy people nationwide and were 38.36\u2009±\u200912.91 for Glu and 31.67\u2009±\u200913.93 for GABA. In order to further explore the influence of drug treatment on the excitatory/inhibitory homeostasis of the brain, the resonance peaks of Glx (contributed by glutamate, glutamine, and GABA together) and Cr (contributed largely by GABA) were obtained at the top of the left frontal lobe by MRS, with the Glx/Cr ratio calculated for each patient before treatment and three months after treatment.\n\nDemographic data were collected from the medical records of included patients, including age, sex, disease course, time of drug initiation and clinical symptoms.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\n### Sample size\n\nthe retrospective nature of the study predetermines the sample size. A priori sample size calculation was not performed.\n\nAll analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The continuous data were tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Continuous data with a normal distribution were represented as means\u2009±\u2009standard deviations and analyzed using ANOVA and the LSD-t post hoc test. Continuous data with a non-normal distribution were presented as medians (ranges) and analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis H-test. Paired sample _t_-test signed rank sum test was used to compare before and after treatment. Categorical data were presented using n (%) and analyzed using the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test. Two-sided P-values\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant. The graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nResults\n-------\n\nAccording to the inclusion criteria, 97 patients with anti NMDAR encephalitis were included, 2 patients with concomitant tumors were excluded, and 5 patients with incomplete clinical data were excluded. Finally, 90 patients with anti NMDAR encephalitis were enrolled. Patients were grouped according to the adjuvant medications they received: group A (olanzapine group, _n_\u2009=\u200936), group B (magnesium valproate group, _n_\u2009=\u200930) and group C (lamotrigine group, _n_\u2009=\u200924).\n\n### Characteristics of the patients\n\nNinety patients were included in the study. The olanzapine group consisted of 24 males and 12 females. The patients were 28.50\u2009±\u20099.29 years old. The median disease course was 9.5 (4.00, 29.05) days. The time to drug initiation was 0 (0, 1) days. The magnesium valproate group included 17 males and 13 females. The patients were 29.97\u2009±\u200911.71 years old. The disease course was 10 (5, 20) days. The time to drug initiation was 0 (0, 2) days. The lamotrigine group included 13 males and 11 females. They were 33.88\u2009±\u20099.59 years old. The disease course was 10 (6.25, 17.25) days. The time to drug initiation was 0 (1, 3) days. There were no significant differences in the above indicators among the three groups (all _P_\u2009>\u20090.05). There were no significant differences in cognitive impairment, motor impairment, speech impairment, autonomic dysfunction, seizures, and decreased consciousness among the three groups before any treatment (all _P_\u2009>\u20090.05).\n\n### Psychiatric symptoms\n\nBefore treatment, there were no significant differences in total PANSS scores, positive symptom scores, negative symptom scores, and general psychopathological scores among the three groups (all _P_\u2009>\u20090.05). After 3 weeks of treatment, the PANSS total score and positive symptom scores in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were lower than in the olanzapine group (all _P_\u2009<\u20090.05). The general psychopathological scores in the magnesium valproate group were lower than in the olanzapine and lamotrigine groups after 3 weeks of treatment (_P_\u2009<\u20090.05). After 3 months of treatment, the PANSS total and negative symptom scores in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were lower than in the olanzapine group (all _P_\u2009<\u20090.05).\n\n### Cognitive functions\n\nAmong the 90 patients, 22 had missing data regarding the MoCA scores, and a total of 68 patients were included in the evaluation of cognitive performance. Among them, 26 patients were in the olanzapine group, 23 were in the magnesium valproate group, and 19 were in the lamotrigine group. Before treatment, the MoCA scores were 21.35\u2009±\u20093.76, 22.39\u2009±\u20094.30, and 22.26\u2009±\u20094.37 in the olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine groups, respectively (_P_\u2009>\u20090.05). After 3 months of treatment, the MoCA scores in the olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine groups were improved compared with baseline (all _P_\u2009<\u20090.05). Notably, after 3 weeks and 3 months of treatment, the scores in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were higher than in the olanzapine group (all _P_\u2009<\u20090.05).\n\n### Functional status of the patients\n\nThere were no significant differences in the mRS score among the olanzapine group (0/36, mRS score 0–1/mRS score\u2009≥\u20092), the magnesium valproate group (0/30), and the lamotrigine group (0/24) before treatment (all _P_\u2009>\u20090.05). After 3 months of treatment, the proportions of patients with an mRS score 0–1 in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were significantly higher than in the olanzapine group (all _P_\u2009<\u20090.05).\n\n### EEG characteristics\n\nBefore treatment, the EEG ranks were 7/29 (No\u2009+\u2009Mi/Mo\u2009+\u2009Se) in the olanzapine group, 7/23 in the magnesium valproate group, and 5/19 in the lamotrigine group. There were no significant differences among the three groups (_P_\u2009>\u20090.05). After 3 weeks and 3 months of treatment, the EEG ranks were as follows: 10/26 after 3 weeks and 18/18 after 3 months in the olanzapine group, 11/19 after 3 weeks, and 24/6 after 3 months in the magnesium valproate group, 12/12 after 3 weeks and 21/3 after 3 months in the olanzapine group. There was a significant improvement in the EEG characteristics after 3 weeks and 3 months of treatment (all _P_\u2009<\u20090.05). The abnormality EEG ranks at 3 months were significantly lower in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups compared with the olanzapine group (all _P_\u2009<\u20090.05).\n\n### Excitatory/inhibitory rebalance\n\nCompared with the reference range for healthy people, the Glu powers (294.41\u2009±\u2009160.09, 300.55\u2009±\u2009205.34, and 314.46\u2009±\u2009224.11 for the olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine groups, respectively) were increased significantly, and the GABA powers (6.31\u2009±\u20095.04, 5.92\u2009±\u20094.68, and 5.26\u2009±\u20094.98 for the olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine groups, respectively) were decreased significantly in all three groups before treatment, while no intergroup difference existed at this point. The olanzapine group showed no significant alterations in Glu and GABA power after 3 months of treatment. Compared with the olanzapine group, the power of Glu was significantly decreased after treatment in the magnesium valproate group, whereas the power of GABA was significantly elevated after treatment. Similarly, compared with the olanzapine group, the power of Glu was decreased, and the power of GABA was increased after treatment in the lamotrigine group.\n\n### Cerebral Glx/Cr ratio measured by MRS\n\nThe Glx/Cr ratios before treatment were 0.35\u2009±\u20090.24, 0.30\u2009±\u20090.10, and 0.28\u2009±\u20090.20 for the olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine groups, respectively (_P_\u2009>\u20090.05). After 3 months of treatment, the Glx/Cr ratio in the olanzapine group remained comparable to the pre-treatment levels. However, in the magnesium valproate group, the Glx/Cr ratio significantly decreased, and in the lamotrigine group, it decreased compared to the pre-treatment levels. Furthermore, the Glx/Cr ratios obtained after 3 months of treatment were significantly lower in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups compared to the olanzapine group.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\nThe findings of this study indicate that the addition of magnesium valproate or lamotrigine to immunotherapy might be associated with lower PANSS scores and higher MoCA scores compared to olanzapine. It has been observed that patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis show an imbalance between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in the brain. The beneficial effects of magnesium valproate and lamotrigine appear to be associated with restoring the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain.\n\nIn patients with anti NMDAR encephalitis, the incidence of epileptic seizures is second only to mental disorders, consistent with previous reports. Other clinical symptoms in the present study included cognitive impairment, autonomic nerve dysfunction, decreased level of consciousness, dyskinesia, and speech disorder, also consistent with clinical characteristics reported in previous studies.\n\nImmunotherapy is the gold standard in the clinical management of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Because the disease often presents with broad and complex neurological and psychiatric symptoms, other central nervous system medicines can be used for anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Along with the mainstay immunotherapy, adjuvant pharmacological intervention to facilitate the homeostasis of neurotransmission in the brain could be beneficial in the clinical management of anti-NMDAR encephalitis by managing specific symptoms related to the imbalance described above.\n\nOlanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine are commonly used antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and other psychiatric diseases. Although their specific use in anti-NMDAR encephalitis carries little evidence, they can be used to manage psychiatric symptoms. Compared with olanzapine, magnesium valproate and lamotrigine led to lower scores on the PANSS total score and positive symptom scores after 3 weeks of treatment. The MoCA scores were significantly higher with magnesium valproate and lamotrigine than with olanzapine. The proportions of patients with good clinical outcomes of mRS scores in the magnesium valproate and lamotrigine groups were greater than in the olanzapine group after 3 months of treatment.\n\nOlanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic agent and exhibits high affinity to many neuroactive receptors, such as serotonin, dopamine α-adrenaline, and histamine, with limited influence on the glutamatergic pathway. Limited evidence (mostly case reports) supports using olanzapine in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, with some effectiveness. Valproate is approved for manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder or for the prevention of migraine headaches; it can competitively inhibit GABA transferase and reduce its metabolism to increase the content of GABA in the brain, which may, in turn, inhibit glutamatergic neurons and reduce glutamate release. The evidence for valproate using in anti-NMDAR encephalitis is also limited but appears favorable, but the use of valproate before an anti-NMDAR encephalitis diagnosis could possibly interfere with the diagnosis. Lamotrigine mainly blocks glutamate release from the presynaptic membrane, inhibiting the excitatory action potential mediated by glutamate and managing seizures. Although lamotrigine has been reported to control the seizures associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, the evidence is limited. Previous evidence suggested that the dysfunction of the glutamatergic pathway is related to the epileptic symptoms of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\n\nHowever, the mechanism by which NMDAR down-regulation causes complex clinical symptoms in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis remains incompletely understood. Some studies have proposed that besides NMDAR down-regulation and resulting glutamatergic hypofunction, an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission may be involved in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations among patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Accordingly, the present study showed that such imbalances exist based on the Glu, GABA, and Glx/Cr ratio obtained by MRS and compared with reference values obtained from 10,000 healthy individuals in China.\n\nBased on their neuropharmacological characteristics, this study evaluated the clinical benefits of adjuvant administration of olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, particularly about their capability of facilitating the rebalance of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Olanzapine treatment did not alter the Glu and GABA powers in the brain, nor the cortical Glx/Cr ratio, which is consistent with the notion that this drug does not modulate the glutamate system in the brain. On the contrary, adjuvant magnesium valproate lowered the Glu power and the Glx/Cr ratio and elevated GABA power in the cerebrum. Similarly, lamotrigine treatment reduced the power of Glu and Glx/Cr ratio but increased the power of GABA in the brain. Importantly, these above differential neurochemical modulations by the three drugs are associated with measurable differences regarding neurological recovery. Thus, compared with olanzapine, magnesium valproate, and lamotrigine showed better therapeutical effects, as indicated by the assessments on the extent of mitigation of mental symptoms, improvement of cognitive function, better functional outcome, and normalization of EEG features in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\n\nThis study had limitations. It was performed at a single hospital and included patients diagnosed over a limited period, resulting in a relatively small sample size. The retrospective nature of the study limited the data that could be analyzed to the ones available in the patient charts. No control group of patients treated with immunotherapy could be included because most patients received adjuvant treatments during the study period. Additional studies with other adjuvant drugs, such as memantine, ketamine, and intrathecal methotrexate, should be carried out to determine the most optimal adjuvant treatments and determine whether specific subgroups of patients could benefit more from a given drug.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThis study shows that based on standard immunotherapy, adjuvant therapeutics aiming to correct the cerebral Glu/GABA or excitatory/inhibitory imbalance, such as valproate and lamotrigine, can improve the clinical outcome among patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\n\nData availability\n-----------------\n\nAll data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article.\n\nAbbreviations\n-------------\n\n3M: The 3rd month\n\n3W: The 3rd week\n\nBT: Before drug treatment\n\nCr: Creatine, contributed largely by GABA\n\nEEG: Electroencephalogram\n\nGABA: Glutamate (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid\n\nGlx: Glutamate, contributed by glutamate, glutamine, and GABA together\n\nMo\u2009+\u2009Se: Moderate background and severe background abnormalities.\n\nMoCA: Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale\n\nMRS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy\n\nmRS: Modified Rankin scale score\n\nNMDAR: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor\n\nNo\u2009+\u2009Mi: Normal and mild background abnormalities\n\nPANSS: Positive and negative symptom scale\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n1.

They studied the molecular mechanisms of action of metformin on HIV replication in CD4 T lymphocytes, which are immune system cells that provide shelter for the virus.\n\nIn these reservoirs, HIV keeps on replicating, which contributes to the chronic inflammation by constantly activating the immune system.\n\n"The results of our in vitro tests on cells from people living with HIV and treated with antiretroviral therapy caught us off guard at first," said Ancuta. "They were a bit surprising. We discovered that metformin had both a proviral and an antiviral effect. The drug helped boost the number of HIV-infected cells, while also stopping the virus from escaping the cell."\n\nAntibodies to the rescue\n------------------------\n\nAnother benefit of metformin is that it overexpresses the BST2 protein, which acts as a kind of glue to keep virions clinging to the surface of HIV-infected cells. The immune system then spots them and can target them with antibodies.\n\n"Together with my colleague Andrés Finzi, we tested the ability of several broad-spectrum neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies to recognize viral reservoir cells after metformin exposure in vitro," said Ancuta. "Some of them recognized the virus very well, suggesting their ability to attract and trigger the destruction of infected cells by NK cells through a process of cellular cytotoxicity."\n\nThese recent scientific advances mean that the "shock-and-kill" eradication strategy, often used in the fight against HIV, can be foreseen in a different way, she added.\n\n"In people living with HIV and treated with antiretroviral therapy, we could use metformin to reactivate the reservoir cells responsible for viral replication upon treatment interruption, in combination with antibodies that are already used clinically and well tolerated. These antibodies can then detect the rare infected cells and eliminate them."\n\nIn the next phase of her research, Ancuta plans to launch a clinical trial to validate her in vitro research results, in collaboration with Finzi and their CRCHUM colleague Nicolas Chomont, and Jean-Pierre Routy of the McGill University Health Center Research Institute.\n\nBefore she can move forward with this strategy, she will test it in preclinical models.\n\n**More information:** Augustine Fert et al, Metformin facilitates viral reservoir reactivation and their recognition by anti-HIV-1 envelope antibodies, _iScience_ (2024).

After all, mirtazapine reduces panic, and it is known panic often comes with episodes of severe breathlessness.\n\nAlthough an earlier trial found sertraline did not affect chronic breathlessness, Higginson and colleagues conducted a study to evaluate whether another antidepressant—mirtazapine—was effective at reducing breathlessness. Findings of BETTER B, an international, multicenter, phase 3, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pragmatic trial, were presented at the ERS Congress in Vienna. The BETTER B trial was conducted in 16 centers in Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, and the UK and was informed by a feasibility trial published in 2020.\n\nThe primary outcome was the reduction of self-reported worst breathlessness over the past 24 hours, measured at day 56, compared with placebo. Secondary outcomes included the worst breathlessness at various times, average breathlessness, number and duration of breathlessness episodes, and physical and emotional aspects of breathlessness such as dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function, and quality life. Another secondary outcome was symptoms and concerns evaluated by the integrated palliative care outcome scale.\n\nThe sample, screened between February 4, 2021, and March 28, 2024, were aged ≥ 18 years (mean age: 74 years); had either COPD, interstitial lung diseases, or both; and were grade 3 or 4 of the modified Medical Research Council breathlessness scale. All participants were stable for the previous 2 weeks before baseline and on optimal treatment for reversible causes of breathlessness, determined by the referring clinician and best clinical guidance. People were excluded from the study if they had existing use of antidepressants or serotonergic active substances, had known contraindications to mirtazapine, or received an Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Scale score of ≤ 40 which indicates they are in bed ≥ 50% of the time.\n\nParticipants (n = 225) were randomized 1:1 to receive either mirtazapine or placebo daily for 56 days. They had a dose of 15 mg orally for the first 14 days. After that, there were 2 assessments for dose escalations, at days 14 and 28. Participants had their dose increased to 30 mg at day 14 and to 45 mg at day 28 if they did not show improvement in their breathlessness, measured using the Numerical Rating Scale over the previous 24 hours. At the end of day 56, the dose was tapered and discontinued.\n\nInvestigators assessed participants at baseline and at days 7, 14, 28, 56, and 7 days after completing the trial to assess for safety and toxicity of the treatment. Participants were called 180 days from baseline by phone, video call, or mail to complete the last self-reported questionnaire. Caregivers completed questionnaires at days 28, 56, and 180.\n\nAt day 14, nearly half (48%) of participants on mirtazapine had escalation, compared with 53% on placebo. At day 28, 35% participants on mirtazapine had escalation, which was slightly less than those on placebo (36%).\n\nAt day 56, 3 participants on mirtazapine and 2 on placebo died. At day 180, the number of people who died was 6% in the mirtazapine arm and 10% in the placebo arm. In total, 5 participants were lost to follow-up, with 3% in the mirtazapine arm and 2% in the placebo arm.\n\nInvestigators did not observe a difference in worst breathlessness score day 56 between mirtazapine and placebo (difference in adjusted mean score [mirtazapine minus placebo], 0.105; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.407 to 0.618; P = .69). The sensitivity analysis, to account for missing data, also found no evidence of a difference between treatment arms (difference in adjusted mean score; 0.232; 95% CI, -9.308 to 0.773; P = .40). Secondary outcomes also demonstrated no differences between the arms in terms of measures of breathlessness, overall palliative symptoms, average breathlessness score, chronic respiratory questionnaire subscales, anxiety and depression, number and duration of breathlessness, Australia-modified Karnofsky performance scale, and generalized-efficacy scale.\n\nThe study reported 215 adverse events in 64% participants on mirtazapine and 40% on placebo, with the most common ones in the mirtazapine arm being dry mouth, somnolence, fatigue, and sedation. Serious adverse events occurred in 5% of participants on mirtazapine and 6% on placebo.\n\n“This new trial concludes that mirtazapine is not recommended for the treatment of breathlessness, that the use of unlicensed medicines should be approached with caution and that it’s crucial to subject medicines in palliative care to rigorous trials,” Higginson said.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The fast track designation is intended to facilitate the development and review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill unmet needs. The designation provides the sponsor with more frequent communication with the FDA as well as eligibility for accelerated approval and priority review.\n\nThis year, Abdera will begin a phase 1, first-in-human study evaluating ABD-147 in LCNEC and SCLC that has been previously treated with platinum-based therapy.\n\nABD-147 is designed to deliver actininum-225 to DLL3-expressing tumors. DLL3 is upregulated in some high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas, including SCLC, while it is typically absent on the surface of nonmalignant cells, making it an attractive target for radiotherapy.\n\n###### REFERENCES:\n\n###### 1.

The data were published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and simultaneously presented today at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Annual Meeting 2024.\n\nIn the trial, efsitora met the primary endpoint of non-inferior A1C reduction. For the efficacy estimand, efsitora reduced A1C by 1.34% compared to 1.26% for insulin degludec resulting in an A1C of 6.87% and 6.95% respectively at 52 weeks.\n\nAdditionally, participants taking efsitora achieved 45 minutes more time in range per day, a key secondary endpoint, without additional time in hypoglycemia (glucose <54 mg/dL) in comparison to insulin degludec for the efficacy estimand.\n\n"Traditionally, basal insulins are dosed once a day — a treatment schedule that can make compliance difficult for a significant portion of people living with type 2 diabetes," said Carol Wysham, M.D., clinical professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine. "Efsitora has the potential to address treatment burden and improve adherence — all while lowering A1C. These results can make a significant impact for people living with type 2 diabetes looking for a once-weekly option that provides similar outcomes as daily insulins."\n\n**Full Results**\n\n**QWINT-2 Study: Primary and Secondary Endpoints**\n\nEfficacy Estimand\n\nTreatment-Regimen Estimand\n\nPrimary Endpoint – A1C Reduction (Resulting A1C) at Week 52\n\nEfsitora\n\n-1.34% (6.87%)\n\n-1.26% (6.97%)\n\nDegludec\n\n-1.26% (6.95%)\n\n-1.17% (7.05%)\n\nSecondary Endpoint – A1C Reduction in Participants using GLP-1s (Resulting A1C) at Week 52\n\nEfsitora\n\n-1.30% (6.90%)\n\n-1.26% (6.96%)\n\nDegludec\n\n-1.28% (6.92%)\n\n-1.19% (7.02%)\n\nSecondary Endpoint – A1C Reduction in Participants not using GLP-1s (Resulting A1C) at Week 52\n\nEfsitora\n\n-1.38% (6.85%)\n\n-1.26% (6.97%)\n\nDegludec\n\n-1.23% (6.99%)\n\n-1.15% (7.08%)\n\nSecondary Endpoint – Percent Time in Range During the 4 Weeks Prior to Week 52\n\nEfsitora\n\n68.86%\n\n64.27%\n\nDegludec\n\n65.75%\n\n61.18%\n\n"For the past century, we\'ve been searching for the next scientific breakthrough that would alleviate the complexity that comes with starting insulin treatment," said Jeff Emmick, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president, product development, Lilly. "With these results, we believe we\'re headed towards a future where people with type 2 diabetes who use basal insulin can achieve their desired results with a simple treatment option like efsitora."\n\nIn the trial, efsitora demonstrated a safety profile similar to daily insulins. There were no severe hypoglycemic events reported during treatment with efsitora compared to six reported with insulin degludec. Overall hypoglycemia rates in the study were low, with estimated combined rates of severe or clinically significant (blood glucose <54 mg/dL) hypoglycemic events per patient-year of exposure of 0.58 with efsitora vs. 0.45 with insulin degludec. Estimated combined rates of severe or clinically significant nocturnal hypoglycemic events per patient-year of exposure were 0.08 with both efsitora and insulin degludec. Additionally, rates of hypoglycemia were similar among people currently using GLP-1s and those not using GLP-1s. Adverse events were similar between treatment groups in the trial.\n\nDetailed results for QWINT-5 are also being presented at EASD and simultaneously published in The Lancet.\n\n**About the QWINT clinical trial program**  \nThe QWINT phase 3 global clinical development program for insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora) in diabetes began in 2022 and has enrolled more than 4,000 people living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes across five global registration studies.\n\nQWINT-2 (NCT05362058) was a parallel-design, open-label, treat-to-target, randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of efsitora as a once-weekly basal insulin to insulin degludec for 52 weeks in insulin-naïve adults with type 2 diabetes. The trial randomized 928 participants across the U.S., Brazil, Canada, China, Czechia (Czech Republic), Germany, Greece, Japan, Korea, Mexico and Puerto Rico to receive efsitora once weekly or insulin degludec once daily administered subcutaneously. The primary objective of the trial was to demonstrate non-inferiority in reducing A1C at week 52 with efsitora compared to insulin degludec. The trial was also designed to assess efficacy and safety for patients using and not using GLP-1 receptor agonists.\n\n**About insulin efsitora alfa**  \nInsulin efsitora alfa (efsitora) is a once-weekly basal insulin, a fusion protein that combines a novel single-chain variant of insulin with a human IgG2 Fc domain. It is specifically designed for once-weekly subcutaneous administration, and with its low peak-to-trough ratio, it has the potential to provide more stable glucose levels (less glucose variability) throughout the week. Efsitora is in phase 3 development for adults with type 1 and 2 diabetes.\n\n**About Lilly**  \nLilly is a medicine company turning science into healing to make life better for people around the world.

As healthcare practitioners, it's crucial to stay informed about PCOS to effectively support our patients.\n\nHere are some practical insights from recent guidelines that can enhance your clinical practice:\n\n- UNDERSTANDING PCOS: This multifactorial condition is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and the presence of polycystic ovaries. Recognition of these symptoms is essential for diagnosis. \n\n- DIAGNOSIS CRITERIA: Effective diagnosis now centers on the presence of two out of three criteria: clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound or elevated serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels. \n\n- LONG-TERM RISKS: It's vital to inform patients of potential long-term health risks, including increased likelihood of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular issues. Regular screenings for these conditions should be part of management plans.  \n\n- WEIGHT MANAGEMENT: Encourage patients to engage in lifestyle modifications, including weight loss and exercise. These changes can significantly improve metabolic profiles and fertility outcomes, regardless of overall BMI.\n\n- TAILORED TREATMENTS: There is no one-size-fits-all treatment. Options range from hormonal contraceptives to anti-androgens based on individual symptoms, with tailored management yielding the best results. \n\n- METFORMIN USE: In primary care, consider metformin for patients with PCOS who have insulin resistance. This off-label use can aid metabolic outcomes, but ensure your patients are informed of its potential side effects.\n\nAs we strive to improve outcomes for women with PCOS, how can we better utilize these guidelines in our practices? Let's discuss! \n\nFor more in-depth insights, check out the article here: http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/top-tips-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-2024a1000fn8", ['Healthcare & Policy', 'GeneralResearch', 'Endocrinology', 'HealthEquity', 'PatientEducation'], 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/8378750/pexels-photo-8378750.jpeg', 'http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/top-tips-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-2024a1000fn8', 'You are a social media content strategist tasked with creating ready-to-use social media posts aimed at healthcare professionals.

PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age, and is a well-known cause of infertility and complications in pregnancy. It is associated with a range of health issues, including insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, steatotic liver disease, and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn the UK, up to one in three women have more than 10 follicles per ovary visible on ultrasound, a condition known as polycystic ovaries; in turn, one in three women with polycystic ovaries will have PCOS. In addition to polycystic ovaries, women with PCOS may have one or more of a group of characteristic features—including acne, male-pattern baldness, hirsutism, amenorrhoea, and oligomenorrhoea—and raised serum levels of testosterone and/or luteinising hormone (LH).\n\n### The Burden of PCOS\n\nThe burden of PCOS on women affected by it can be significant. At one time, it was considered to be mainly a reproductive condition, but it is now accepted that women with PCOS are at high risk of metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, women with PCOS have been shown to have an increased risk of psychological morbidity, asthma, and migraine.\n\n### Guidance on PCOS\n\nAlthough no NICE Guideline has been published specifically on PCOS, the condition is covered in NICE Clinical Guideline 156, _Fertility problems: assessment and treatment_, and further guidance on the symptoms, diagnosis, and management of PCOS is available from other sources, including:\n\n*   the _International evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome 2023_\n    *   summary of recommendations\n    *   full guidance\n*   the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE)/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) Workshop Group\n*   the Androgen Excess Society\n*   the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\n*   the _British National Formulary._\n\nThis article provides seven top tips for primary care practitioners on the causes of PCOS and when to suspect it, approaches to its diagnosis and management, and best practice regarding its treatment.\n\n1\\. Be Aware That the Causes of PCOS Remain Unclear\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nPCOS is reportedly present in around 5–15% of women of reproductive age. However, its prevalence rises to as much as 20% when the diagnostic criteria proposed by the ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group (termed the ‘2003 Rotterdam Criteria’) are used.\n\nThe causes of PCOS remain unclear, but the condition is multifactorial and appears to be inherited as a common, complex genetic disorder. Insulin resistance is found in approximately 65–80% of women with PCOS, independent of obesity, and is worsened by excess weight triggered by the condition. Levels of LH are increased in nearly 40% of women with PCOS because of increased production from the anterior pituitary gland. Theca cells in the ovaries produce excess androgens because of hyperinsulinaemia or increased serum levels of LH, and women with PCOS may also have increased serum oestrogen levels. As a result of continued exposure to oestrogen unopposed by progesterone, the endometrium may become hyperplastic, and testosterone is also converted to oestrogen in peripheral fat.\n\n2\\. Recognise That no Formal Classification System for PCOS Currently Exists\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlthough no formal classification system currently exists for PCOS, proposals have been made to establish one.\n\nBox 1: Phenotypes of PCOS\n\n*   **Mild PCOS (16% of women with PCOS)**—characterised by irregular periods, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, mildly raised androgen concentrations, and normal insulin concentrations\n*   **Ovulatory PCOS (16% of women with PCOS)**—characterised by normal periods, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, high androgen concentrations, and increased insulin concentrations\n*   **Hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation (7% of women with PCOS)**—characterised by irregular periods, normal ovaries on ultrasound, high androgen concentrations, and increased insulin concentrations; this phenotype has potential long-term risks\n*   **Severe PCOS (61% of women with PCOS)**—characterised by irregular periods, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, high androgen concentrations, and increased insulin concentrations; this phenotype also has potential long-term risks.\n\nCurrent guidance recommends that PCOS should be diagnosed using the international evidence-based guideline criteria, which build on the consensus-based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. These require the presence of two of the following to diagnose PCOS:\n\n*   clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism\n*   ovulatory dysfunction\n*   polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.\n\nAlternatively, assessment of serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound, provided that other aetiologies are also excluded. Importantly, when irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is now simplified, and ultrasound or AMH are not required. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended because of poor specificity. Note that, according to the 2003 Rotterdam criteria, a diagnosis of PCOS can only be made when other causes have been ruled out, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumours, or Cushing’s syndrome.\n\nThe international evidence-based guideline criteria differ slightly from those issued in 2006 by the Androgen Excess Society, which require all of the following to be present for a diagnosis of PCOS to be made:\n\n*   hyperandrogenism—hirsutism and/or hyperandrogenaemia\n*   ovarian dysfunction—oligo-ovulation or anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries\n*   exclusion of other androgen excess or related disorders.\n\n3\\. Know That a Diagnosis of PCOS is One of Exclusion\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nCommon features of PCOS include hirsutism (present in 60% of women), acne (present in 15–25%), scalp hair loss or male-pattern baldness (present in 5%), irregular and infrequent periods, weight gain or difficulty losing weight, and infertility. Acanthosis nigricans may also be present, especially in obese women with PCOS, and is thought to be linked to insulin resistance. Less commonly, there may be deepening of the voice, clitoromegaly, and increased muscle mass.\n\nSymptoms typically begin at the time of puberty and, in younger women, may be difficult to distinguish from the irregular menses that often occur in the first year after menarche. Although the diagnostic criteria for PCOS during adolescence are controversial, guidelines recommend that both ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism must be present to diagnose PCOS in adolescents.\n\nBody mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio should be checked in all women with PCOS, as 40–80% of women with the syndrome are overweight or obese, with central obesity predominating (a waist-to-hip ratio of at least 0.85, or waist circumference of at least 88 cm). Blood pressure should also be monitored, as women with PCOS may have elevated blood pressure.\n\nDifferential diagnoses of PCOS are presented in Box 2.\n\nBox 2: Differential Diagnoses of PCOS\n\n*   Hypothyroidism\n*   Hyperprolactinaemia\n*   Acromegaly\n*   Cushing’s syndrome and androgen-secreting tumours\n*   Iatrogenic side effects from medication causing hirsutism such as danazol, high-dose corticosteroids, ciclosporin, and phenytoin.\n\n4\\. Understand That Investigations for PCOS Consist of Endocrine Tests and Ovarian Imaging\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe three main endocrine abnormalities in PCOS are:\n\n*   elevated serum LH levels, with normal serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels\n*   elevated free testosterone levels (a combination of increased testosterone production and reduced sex hormone-binding globulin), and\n*   insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinaemia.\n\nWomen with PCOS typically have a serum testosterone level above 2.5 nmol/l and a serum LH level above 10 IU/l. If the total testosterone level is above 5 nmol/l, always check for other possible causes of androgen hypersecretion, such as androgen-secreting adrenal or ovarian tumours, or nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Fasting plasma glucose and/or glycated haemoglobin are useful for assessing insulin resistance. Although these tests are less accurate than the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), they are acceptable alternatives if an OGTT cannot be performed. A lipid profile should also be obtained to evaluate cardiovascular risk. Prolactin testing is recommended to exclude hyperprolactinaemia, which may present with oligo-ovulation or anovulation. In addition, thyroid function tests are important because thyroid dysfunction may present with oligo-ovulation or anovulation, or irregular and heavy menstrual bleeding, and weight gain.\n\nUltrasound is used to assess for the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology, unless the diagnosis of PCOS is obvious on clinical and biochemical grounds. When appropriate, transvaginal ultrasound provides higher-resolution images of the ovaries compared with transabdominal ultrasound. Remember that the presence of polycystic ovaries alone does not confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasound should not be used to diagnose PCOS in adolescents and, in adults, it should ideally be done in the early follicular phase (days 3–5) after a spontaneous or progestin-withdrawal-induced menstruation. If menstrual bleeding is infrequent or reduced, ultrasound can be done at any time. If endometrial thickening is found on imaging, an endometrial biopsy is indicated to determine whether endometrial hyperplasia or cancer is present.\n\n5\\. Inform Women About Possible Long-term Risks and Lifestyle Interventions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHealthcare professionals should inform women with PCOS about the potential long-term health risks that are associated with the syndrome. Obesity, dyslipidaemia, and insulin resistance all increase cardiovascular risk, and screening should be offered for impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes.\n\nWomen diagnosed with PCOS should be advised about weight loss and exercise, as weight loss improves fertility and pregnancy outcomes, psychological symptoms, and metabolic risk—even if BMI remains raised. A low-glycaemic-index diet may be helpful in managing PCOS. Hypertension should be treated in the usual way, although there is no rationale for the routine use of statins in women with PCOS outside normal guidelines.\n\n6\\. Consider the Range of Available Treatments\n----------------------------------------------\n\nNo single treatment can reverse the hormonal changes of PCOS or address all of its clinical features; therefore, medical management should be tailored to each individual’s specific symptoms. The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) is one of the treatments often considered, provided that there are no contraindications. It should be prescribed with the usual guidance about risks, side effects, and potential drug interactions. However, COCPs containing 35 mcg ethinyloestradiol and cyproterone acetate should not be used as a first-line treatment for PCOS because of their potential adverse effects, which include venous thromboembolism.\n\nIf acne is a significant issue, topical retinoids or antibiotics and/or oral antibiotics can be prescribed as appropriate. If hirsutism is present, hair removal methods, such as waxing or shaving, should be discussed. In general, the oral contraceptive pill is more effective for acne than for hirsutism in PCOS.\n\nIn women with prolonged amenorrhoea or abnormal vaginal bleeding, a cyclical progestogen should be prescribed to induce a withdrawal bleed, followed by a referral for a transvaginal ultrasound to assess endometrial thickness. If endometrial thickening is present, clinicians should refer women for endometrial sampling to exclude endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. If the endometrium is normal, women should be advised on treatment to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and its associated risks. These options include a low-dose COCP, a cyclical progestogen, or a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD). If a woman is unwilling to take cyclical hormone treatment or use the LNG-IUD, specialist advice should be sought, as regular ultrasound is required to assess endometrial thickness.\n\nIf a woman with PCOS presents with infertility and wishes to conceive, NICE Clinical Guideline 156, _Fertility problems: assessment and treatment_, recommends that—after weight loss (when indicated) and a full fertility work-up—treatment should include clomifene citrate, metformin, or a combination of both. Clomifene citrate appears to be preferable to metformin for ovulation induction in women with obesity and PCOS.\n\n7\\. Keep in Mind That Metformin is Used Off Label to Treat PCOS\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn primary care, when considering starting metformin in women with PCOS but without diabetes, clinicians should consider seeking specialist advice, as metformin is not currently licensed for this indication. The _International evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS 2023_, issued by the International PCOS Network, makes the following recommendations on the use of metformin for indications not relating to fertility:\n\n*   in addition to lifestyle interventions, metformin alone should be considered in women with a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2 for anthropometric and metabolic outcomes, including insulin resistance, glucose, and lipid profiles\n*   in combination with a COCP, metformin may be most beneficial in high metabolic risk groups, including women with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m², diabetes risk factors, and/or impaired glucose tolerance, and/or who have a high-risk ethnic background.\n\nIf metformin is initiated in primary care, off-label use should be explained alongside the fact that adverse effects may occur, such as gastrointestinal symptoms and reduced vitamin B12 levels.\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nPCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age, as well as being a major cause of infertility and pregnancy complications. It gives rise to symptoms of hyperandrogenism, the presence of hyperandrogenaemia, oligo-ovulation or anovulation, and polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound. It is strongly associated with complications including insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, steatotic liver disease, and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The main aims of treatment are to reduce hyperandrogenism and to induce fertility. Primary care doctors are in an ideal position to identify women with symptoms and signs of PCOS early, and by doing so help to reduce the significant burden that PCOS can place on people with the condition.\n\nKey Points \n\n*   PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age, and a well-known cause of infertility and pregnancy complications\n*   In the UK, up to one in three women have more than 10 follicles per ovary visible on ultrasound (polycystic ovaries), and one in three women with polycystic ovaries will have PCOS\n*   PCOS is defined as the presence of polycystic ovaries together with one or more characteristic features, including acne, male-pattern baldness, hirsutism, amenorrhoea, and oligomenorrhoea, and raised serum levels of testosterone and/or LH\n*   The cause of PCOS is unclear, but it is multifactorial and inherited as a common, complex genetic disorder\n*   Insulin resistance is found in approximately 65–80% of women with PCOS, independent of obesity, and is exacerbated by excess weight triggered by the condition\n*   LH levels are increased in nearly 40% of women with PCOS because of increased production from the anterior pituitary gland\n*   Women with PCOS may also have increased serum oestrogen and testosterone levels\n*   Investigations for PCOS consist of endocrine tests and ovarian imaging\n*   Ultrasound is used to assess the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology, unless the diagnosis of PCOS is obvious on clinical and biochemical grounds\n*   No single treatment can reverse the hormonal changes of PCOS or address all of its clinical features, so medical management should be tailored to each individual’s symptoms\n*   Metformin, in combination with a combined oral contraceptive pill, may offer greater benefit in high metabolic risk groups, including women with a BMI >30 kg/m², diabetes risk factors, and/or impaired glucose tolerance, and/or from high-risk ethnic groups\n*   If metformin is initiated in primary care, off-label use should be explained alongside the fact that adverse effects may occur, such as gastrointestinal symptoms and reduced vitamin B12 levels.\n\nNote: At the time of publication (September 2024), some of the treatments discussed in this article did not have UK marketing authorisation for the indications discussed.

Practitioners are encouraged to adopt MAINSTREAM, ONCOLOGY-LED GENETIC TESTING for all women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer under 50, those with triple-negative breast cancer, or bilateral cases, and even for affected men. \n\nAs we refine our screening processes, what changes are you considering in your approach to genetic testing for breast cancer? 🤔 \n\nFor more information, read the full study here: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2823091', ['Research & Clinical Trials', 'Genomics', 'Oncology', 'ClinicalTrials', 'PatientSafety', 'HealthcareInnovation'], 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/7723619/pexels-photo-7723619.jpeg', 'http://medscape.com/viewarticle/should-genetic-testing-be-routine-breast-cancer-2024a1000ggq', 'You are a social media content strategist tasked with creating ready-to-use social media posts aimed at healthcare professionals.

However, these criteria may overlook patients with actionable genetic variants, particularly those outside the typical risk profile.\n*   To assess the efficacy of universal genetic testing, researchers conducted a cross-sectional study that included 729 women (median age at diagnosis, 53 years; 65.4% White women) newly diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between September 2019 and April 2022 at three Canadian institutions.\n*   All patients received genetic counseling followed by testing for the presence of germline pathogenic variants in 17 breast cancer susceptibility genes. The primary gene panel included screening for _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, and _PALB2_\xa0and the optional secondary panel included 14 additional breast cancer susceptibility genes.\n*   Of the participants, 659 (90.4%) were tested for both primary and secondary gene panels, whereas 70 (9.6%) underwent testing for only the primary panel. The majority of the cohort (66.8) were diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer, while 15.4% had triple-negative breast cancer.\n\n**TAKEAWAY:**\n-------------\n\n*   The prevalence of germline pathogenic variants was 7.3% (53 patients) — 5.3% for the\xa0primary gene panel and 2.1% for the secondary panel.\n*   Younger age (< 40 years; odds ratio \\[OR\\], 6.83), family history of ovarian cancer (OR, 9.75), high-grade disease (OR, 1.68), and triple-negative breast cancer (OR, 3.19) were independently associated with the presence of pathogenic genetic variants in _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, or _PALB2_.\n*   Overall, 34.3% of patients with germline pathogenic variants in _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, or _PALB2,_ and 85.7% of carriers of secondary panel variants would not have qualified for traditional genetic testing according to the current risk factors.\n*   A total of 13 patients with _BRCA1_, _BRCA2_, or _PALB2_\xa0variants had confirmed pathogenic mutations and were eligible for poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.\n\n**IN PRACTICE:**\n----------------\n\nThese findings have "informed our clinical practice, and we now offer mainstream, oncology-led genetic testing to all women diagnosed with incident invasive breast cancer younger than 50 years of age, those with triple-negative breast cancer and/or bilateral breast cancer, those potentially eligible for PARP inhibitors," as well as to men with breast cancer, the authors wrote.\n\n**SOURCE:**\n-----------\n\nThe study was led by Zoulikha Rezoug, MSc, Lady Davis Institute of the Jewish General Hospital, McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was [published online](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2823091) on September 3, 2024, in _JAMA Network Open_.\n\n**LIMITATIONS:**\n----------------\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 6-month recruitment pause. Adjustments in recruitment criteria, focus on younger patients and those with triple-negative breast cancer could have overestimated prevalence of genetic pathogenic variants among women aged ≥ 70 years.\n\n**DISCLOSURES:**\n----------------\n\nThe study was supported by grants from the Jewish General Hospital Foundation and the Quebec Breast Cancer Foundation, as well as an award from the Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Santé. Two authors reported receiving grants or personal fees from various sources.\n\n_This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.

Content: ['2024-09-11 09:00:00', '2024-09-11 13:04:53', "🤔 Could our approach to treating pediatric strep throat be due for a shift?\n\n- A recent study involving 88 children aged 3-15 years with group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis found that amoxicillin did not significantly shorten fever duration compared to placebo. In fact, both fever length and pain intensity showed no major differences between the two groups.\n\n- 📊 Interestingly, the placebo group had a higher rate of positive throat cultures at day 30 (relative risk of 4.44), suggesting that antibiotics may not be as essential as previously thought in uncomplicated cases.\n\n- This leads to a crucial takeaway: In regions with good access to healthcare, a more cautious approach towards antibiotic prescribing might be warranted. Active follow-up combined with a stepwise prescription strategy could help mitigate unnecessary antibiotic use and its associated risks.\n\nAs healthcare professionals, how do we strike the right balance between treating our young patients and preventing antibiotic resistance? Let's discuss! \n\nFor further details, check out the study: http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/antibiotics-may-not-reduce-fever-duration-paediatric-strep-2024a1000g7k", ['Research & Clinical Trials', 'ClinicalTrials', 'Pediatrics', 'InfectiousDiseases', 'HealthPolicy'], 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/9874622/pexels-photo-9874622.jpeg', 'http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/antibiotics-may-not-reduce-fever-duration-paediatric-strep-2024a1000g7k', 'You are a social media content strategist tasked with creating ready-to-use social media posts aimed at healthcare professionals.

"Overall, our findings support a more restrictive attitude towards prescribing antibiotics."\n\nSOURCE:\n-------\n\nConducted by a Swiss team, the study appeared in _European Journal of Pediatrics_.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n------------\n\nMany parents were reluctant to allow participation and recruitment stopped well short of goal. Small sample sizes resulted in wide confidence intervals.\n\nDISCLOSURES:\n------------\n\nThe study was funded by the University of Geneva, Gertrude Von Meissner Foundation, Geneva University Hospitals, and Société Académique de Genève. The authors declared they had no conflicts of interest.\n\nReferences\n\nGualtieri R, Verolet C, Mardegan C, et al.

How can we refine our strategies to minimize hypoglycemia while managing diabetes effectively in this vulnerable population? 🤔 \n\nRead more on this important topic here: https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/doi/10.2337/dc24-1058/157153/Diabetes-Overtreatment-and-Hypoglycemia-in-Older', ['Research & Clinical Trials', 'Endocrinology', 'DigitalHealth', 'PatientSafety', 'HealthOutcomes', 'Geriatrics'], 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/6823493/pexels-photo-6823493.jpeg', 'https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/doi/10.2337/dc24-1058/157153/Diabetes-Overtreatment-and-Hypoglycemia-in-Older', 'You are a social media content strategist tasked with creating ready-to-use social media posts aimed at healthcare professionals.

The primary outcome was time below range (TBR) ≥ 1%.\n\nRESULTS\n\nOf the 134 patients included (81.6 ± 5.4 years, 59% male), 25 (19%) and 53 (40%) were overtreated, based on fixed and individualized proxy definitions, respectively. CGM data showed TBR >1% in nearly all patients regardless of overtreatment status. Both proxy definitions had low sensitivity (20% [14%; 29%] and 41% [32%; 50%]) and accuracy (27% [20%; 35%] and 44% [35%; 53%]) in predicting hypoglycemia.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nA revised definition of diabetes overtreatment is needed to better manage older insulin-treated patients and protect them from hypoglycemia.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

Since then, the first commercial doses of piflufolastat (18F) have been offered in Greece in November 2023, Italy in February 2024, the Netherlands in March 2024, Germany and France in May 2024, Austria in June 2024, and now Spain.\n\nThe diagnostic also received FDA approval in the United States in May 2021.\n\n### Data on piflufolastat (18F)\n\nPiflufolastat (18F) (Pylarify) was approved in the United States in May 2021 based on data from the phase 3 OSPREY (NCT02981368) and CONDOR (NCT03739684) trials, which demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the tracer in different clinical settings.\n\nBoth trials enrolled patients with prostate cancer who were given a single dose of piflufolastat (18F) for the study.\n\nIn total, the OSPREY trial enrolled 385 patients who were divided into 2 cohorts: cohort A, consisting of 252 evaluable patients with high-risk prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy, and cohort B, consisting of 93 evaluable patients with suspected recurrent/metastatic prostate cancer on conventional imaging.\n\nData from the trial showed high specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) with piflufolastat (18F) prior to initial therapy. In cohort A, the median specificity with piflufolastat (18F) was 97.9% among 3 readers, and the median sensitivity was 40.3%. The median PPV and the median negative predictive value with the diagnostic was 86.7% and 83.2%, respectively.\n\nIn cohort B of the study, the median sensitivity of the agent was 95.8%, and the PPV for extraprostatic lesions was 81.9%.\n\nThe agent was also studied in the phase 3 CONDOR study, which enrolled 208 men with prostate cancer with uninformative baseline imaging and a median baseline PSA of 0.8 ng/mL. The primary end point was correct localization rate (CLR), defined as PPV with anatomic lesion colocalization between piflufolastat (18F) and a composite standard of truth.\n\nData from the trial showed high rates of CLR and detection with piflufolastat (18F) in patients with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer, including in those with low PSA values. Overall, the CLR was found to be 84.8% to 87.0%. The disease detection rate, defined as 1 lesion detected per patient by piflufolastat (18F) by central readers, was 59% to 66%. Among all patients, 63.9% had a change in intended management following piflufolastat (18F).\n\nAdverse events from both trials were observed among 2% or less of patients, which included headache, dysgeusia, and fatigue. One patient with a history of allergic reactions also reported experiencing a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the treatment.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

Results showed those with positive endoscopic findings for mucosal damage had a greater risk of being diagnosed with PD compared to those without mucosal damage.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the prevalence of PD has doubled in the past 25 years, and global estimates showed more than 8.5 million individuals were living with PD in 2019. A neurodegenerative disorder predominately affecting dopaminergic neurons in the brain, PD causes problems with movement, mental health, sleep, pain, and other health issues. Although emerging research suggests PD results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and although a gut-first hypothesis has gained traction, the exact cause of PD is not known.\n\n“A significant gap remains in understanding the relationship between broader upper GI mucosal damage, such as peptic ulcer disease and erosions, and the development of Parkinson disease, as most studies to date have focused on correlational links to a history of H pylori infection,” Trisha Pasricha, MD, MPH, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and colleagues wrote.\n\nTo determine the association between gastrointestinal mucosal damage and subsequent risk of being diagnosed with PD, investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing upper endoscopy with biopsy between January 2000 and December 2005, with final follow-up assessments completed by July 31, 2023. The study was conducted within the Mass General Brigham system, and patients were selected using the Research Patient Data Registry, a Mass General Brigham-based electronic database storing data on patient demographics, encounters, medications, procedures, and billing codes.\n\nUsing the search query tool, investigators identified a cohort of 18,305 patients who had a history of upper endoscopy with biopsy between 2000 and 2005 and no history of PD prior to initial upper endoscopy, 11,293 of whom were included in the study. Patients with positive endoscopic findings for mucosal damage, including erosions, esophagitis, ulcers, and peptic injury, were matched in a 1:3 ratio to patients without mucosal damage based on age, sex, and date of upper endoscopy.\n\nEach participant was followed up until a diagnosis of Parkinson disease; death; or, in the absence of a PD diagnosis, censoring at an outpatient appointment with no subsequent follow-up for > 2 years, representing loss to follow-up, or until July 31, 2023. Investigators identified cases of PD through ICD-9 codes confirmed by a history of PD-specific prescriptions.\n\nInvestigators additionally conducted 2 nested case-control analyses, including one within the group of patients previously found without mucosal damage and the second within the group of patients previously found to have mucosal damage. In both nested analyses, cases were matched to controls without PD in a 1:2 ratio based on age at upper endoscopy, sex, and date of each case’s PD diagnosis by incidence density sampling.\n\nOf the 11,293 patients included in the study, 9350 were included in the Cox proportional hazards model. Among this cohort, the mean age was 52.3 (Standard deviation [SD], 20.3) years and the majority of patients (55.4%) were male and White (73.7%). Additionally, investigators noted most participants underwent endoscopy between the ages of 50 and 64 years (30.4%). Of these patients, 2337 were found to have evidence of mucosal damage on endoscopy while 7013 did not.\n\nAmong all patients included in the study, 2338 patients had mucosal damage, and 52 (2.2%) were later diagnosed with PD. Of the 8955 patients without mucosal damage, 48 (0.5%) were later diagnosed with PD, indicating a notably increased likelihood of PD diagnosis among patients with mucosal damage compared with those without (2.2% vs 0.5%; P <.001; IRR, 4.15; 95% CI, 2.89-5.97; P <.001).\n\nAfter adjusting for additional covariates including age at endoscopy, sex, race, Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index, constipation, dysphagia, and H pylori, the risk associated with mucosal damage remained pronounced (hazard ratio [HR], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11-2.51; P = .01). Further analysis revealed age (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P <.001), CCI (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.09-1.35; P <.001), constipation (HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.72–4.08; P <.001), and dysphagia (HR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.52-3.56; P <.001) as factors associated with an increased risk of developing PD.\n\nWithin the first nested subgroup of patients with mucosal damage, investigators did not note any significant demographic differences between patients with a clinical diagnosis PD and those without, although they pointed out patients with PD had a higher baseline prevalence of chronic NSAID use and GERD. Upon analysis, H pylori (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.84; 95% CI, 1.22-12.13; P = .02) and GERD (aOR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.04-14.76; P = .04) were associated with a markedly higher probability of developing PD.\n\nWithin the second nested subgroup of patients without mucosal damage, investigators again noted no significant demographic differences between patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD and those without, although patients with PD had a higher baseline prevalence of GERD. Chronic NSAID use, chronic smoking, GERD, PPI use, and H pylori were incorporated into this analysis, but investigators noted none of these covariates were associated with an increased risk of developing PD.\n\nInvestigators acknowledged multiple limitations to these findings, including the inability to capture cases of PD diagnosed and treated outside the MGB system; differences in baseline age distribution and mean CCI between patients with MD compared with those without; reliance on ICD codes for multiple exposures and outcomes; small sample sizes in the nested case-control analyses; and the risk of bias from unknown confounding.\n\n“These findings highlight the necessity for heightened monitoring of patients with MD given their increased clinical PD susceptibility and the importance of establishing gut biomarkers,” investigators concluded. “With PUD globally affecting upwards of 8.09 million people and H pylori infection even more widespread, timely detection and treatment of H pylori infection, along with MD management, may prove crucial to early recognition of risk of and potentially intervention against PD.”\n\n**References**\n\n1.

Thus, a patient receiving central venous catheters for hemodialysis (CVC-HD) vs. a fistula (whether autologous or prosthetic) is at four times greater risk for experiencing an infectious complication, and this risk is multiplied tenfold when the sole vascular access is a CVC-HD.”\n\nResearchers ran a multicenter prospective cohort study of data on 337 central venous catheters for hemodialysis from 310 adults receiving treatment across nine hospitals in Spain. Patients included in the EXIT site Assessment study had a tunneled central venous catheter for hemodialysis for at least 1 month after insertion.\n\nThe study produced 515 total cultures, of which 117 were infected and 398 were not.\n\nThe scale consisted of five signs and symptoms at the exit site: pain during the interdialytic period; hyperemia or erythema of at least 2 cm; inflammation, induration or swelling; fever of at least 38°C; 100.4°F not attributable to other causes; and abscess or purulent exudate.\n\nNurses assessed exit sites using the scale. If any relevant symptoms were present, they collected a skin swab culture from around the catheter to confirm the presence of infection.\n\nResearchers confirmed three exit site signs and symptoms in the final version of the scale: pain between dialysis sessions; hyperemia or redness of at least 2 cm; and abscess or purulent exudate. The scale had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 88.3%, with a sensitivity of 80.34% and a specificity of 95.23%.\n\nCobo-Sánchez and colleagues found the scale had positive predictive properties, detecting around 90% of exit-site infections with acceptable validity parameters.\n\n“The use of this scale facilitates the early detection and treatment of exit site infection, before its microbiological confirmation,” the researchers wrote. “Furthermore, its use would improve observational objectivity by ensuring uniformity of classification, thus facilitating the comparison of results, the continuity of care, cost savings, patient education, and the comparison of research studies on measures for prevention and/or treatment.”\n\n**Source:** [Cobo-Sánchez J, et al. _Kidney_ _Int Rep_. 2024;doi:10.1016/j.ekir.2024.06.034.](https://www.kireports.org/article/S2468-0249/(24/)01811-4/fulltext)\n\n**Disclosures:** Cobo-Sánchez reports no relevant financial disclosures.

Aisa is developing AISA-021 for the treatment of Systemic Sclerosis (SSc), a rare disease, which impacts approximately 175,000 Americans and has the highest mortality rate of any autoimmune disease.\n\n"To our knowledge, this is the first time the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to a calcium channel antagonist for an autoimmune illness," said Andrew Sternlicht, MD, CEO and Founder of Aisa Pharma. "We hope this designation will accelerate our development program for AISA-021, which is designed to provide a once-daily, well-tolerated, and economical treatment that we hope can improve the lives of patients with SSc. We are actively seeking a development partner and investors to support bringing this much-needed treatment to patients."\n\nUnder the FDA\'s Orphan Drug Act, orphan drug status provides incentives, including tax credits, grants and waiver of certain administrative fees for clinical trials, and seven years of market exclusivity following drug approval. To be granted the orphan drug designation, FDA concludes that it is medically plausible that the treatment may improve the disease.\n\nAisa submitted information from the ongoing Phase 2 study demonstrating improvement on several endpoints versus placebo, including SSc symptoms of overall disease severity, disease-related pain, gastrointestinal dysfunction, skin ulcers, disability, and breathing symptoms, as well as Raynaud\'s symptoms. In a preliminary review by an independent data safety committee, the ongoing study of 60 patients demonstrated a much lower incidence and severity of side effects as well as improved efficacy for preventing Raynaud\'s attacks, when compared to published reviews of current therapies.\n\nAisa also provided the following corporate updates:\n\n* A Pre-IND meeting with the FDA for AISA-021 in the treatment of Systemic Sclerosis and Secondary Raynaud\'s Phenomenon is scheduled for September 2024.  \n* The initial drug screening performed by the NIH as part of the Preclinical Pain Screening Platform to evaluate the suitability of AISA-021 as a non-opioid analgesic, demonstrated no abuse liability or addictive potential for the drug. Additional results are pending.  \n* Two abstracts on AISA-021 will be presented at the ACR Convergence Scientific Meeting in Washington DC on 11/16/2024:\n\n_AISA 021, a Novel Calcium Channel Antagonist in Development for Raynaud\'s & Systemic Sclerosis, Has Activity at Sodium Channel Targets for Pain Relief and Treats Scleroderma Pain Better Than Current Calcium Channel Blockers in a Phase 2A Study_\n\n_Preliminary Results from the RECONNOITER Trial, a Phase 2 Study of AISA 021 in the Treatment of Secondary Raynaud\'s, Primarily Due to Systemic Sclerosis_\n\n**About AISA-021:** AISA-021 is a form of cilnidipine, a fourth-generation calcium channel blocker (CCB), distinguished from other dihydropyridine CCBs by its increased selectivity for the N-type calcium channel. Cilnidipine is approved in certain Asian countries and widely used to treat hypertension there, but was never approved in the US, Canada, EU and UK. Cilnidipine causes vasodilation and further improves function in the heart, kidney and vasculature. In robust studies of hypertension treatment, cilnidipine is better tolerated with a wider therapeutic window than other approved CCBs, which are used off-label for Raynaud\'s. Unlike other approved CCBs, AISA-021 may also have a role in treating pain.\n\n**About Systemic Sclerosis and Raynaud\'s Phenomenon in Systemic Sclerosis:** Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is the most fatal of autoimmune illnesses and affects approximately 175,000 patients in the United States. Approximately half of patients die of the disease within 12 years from initial diagnosis and 95% of SSc patients experience Raynaud\'s symptoms, which they describe as their most debilitating symptom. Raynaud\'s Phenomenon is characterized by decreased blood flow which can cause severe pain and tingling in the hands and fingers. Cardiac, renal and vascular disease, which have been shown to improve in patients treated for hypertension, contribute to morbidity and mortality in patients with SSc. No drug has been approved anywhere in the world for the treatment of Raynaud\'s.\n\n**About Aisa Pharma Inc.** Aisa is a private biopharmaceutical company in Boston, MA, founded in 2019.

It is caused by the accumulation of bacterial plaque, and if left untreated, it can lead to the destruction of the tissues that hold the teeth in place, ultimately resulting in tooth loss.\n\n“This tooth loss can affect essential functions like chewing and speaking, while also affecting self-esteem,” says researcher Dr Fernando Valentim Bitencourt, from the Department of Dentistry and Oral Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.\n\n“As a result, periodontitis can significantly reduce a person’s quality of life, leading to difficulties with nutrition, communication, and social interactions.\n\n“Understanding who is at higher risk, such as individuals with diabetes complications, is crucial for early intervention and prevention of these far-reaching effects.”\n\nSome studies have found that individuals with microvascular complications of diabetes such as retinopathy (damage to the blood vessels of the retina) and neuropathy (damage to the nerves) are at higher risk of periodontitis.\n\nHowever, the results have been inconsistent and the studies have been small and have failed to take into account important confounding variables – factors such as sociodemographic status, smoking and diabetes duration – that can affect their outcome.\n\nIn addition, the joint impact of microvascular complications and dyslipidaemia (unhealthy levels of blood fats) has not been evaluated.\n\nTo address this, Dr Bitencourt and colleagues from Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus and National Dental Centre Singapore, analysed data on more than 15,000 individuals from the Health in Central Denmark study of people with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe analysis involved 15,922 individuals (with a mean age of 63.7 years) with type 2 diabetes who had completed a questionnaire and a comprehensive laboratory examination.\n\nThe results, which were adjusted for potential confounding variables including sociodemographic status, lifestyle habits (including smoking and physical activity levels) and health conditions, found a clear link between microvascular complications and moderate/severe cases of periodontitis.\n\nIndividuals with diabetic retinopathy were 21% more likely to have moderate/severe periodontitis than those without complications of diabetes.\n\nDiabetic neuropathy was associated with a 36% increase in risk of having severe gum disease. When the participants had both diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy, their likelihood of having moderate/severe periodontitis was 51% higher than in those without complications of diabetes.\n\nThe presence of dyslipidaemia further increased the odds of having moderate/severe periodontitis in those with diabetes complications.\n\nDr Bitencourt says: “When diabetes is poorly controlled high blood sugar levels can lead to inflammation which, over time, can affect the eyes, leading to retinopathy, or the nerves in the feet, causing neuropathy, or the gums, contributing to the development of severe periodontitis.\n\n“Dyslipidaemia, which is very common, further increases the risk of severe gum disease.\n\n“Importantly, the role of inflammation means that that periodontitis might not only serve as a marker for oral health issues but could also help identify individuals with a higher systemic inflammatory burden, who are therefore at greater risk of diabetes-associated microvascular complications.”\n\nThe researchers say that the take-home message for dentists and healthcare practitioners is clear: it is important to have a multidisciplinary approach when treating individuals with type 2 diabetes.\n\n“For dentists, in particular, this means recognising that patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate/severe periodontitis, especially those with dyslipidaemia, may be at a higher risk for microvascular complications such as neuropathy and retinopathy,” says Dr Bitencourt. “Dentists should consider recommending that these patients be screened for microvascular complications.\n\n“By working together, healthcare providers can help ensure that patients with type 2 diabetes, especially those who are at an elevated risk of diabetes complications, receive more comprehensive oral health care – potentially improving both their oral and overall health.”\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n#### Journal\n\nJournal of Dental Research\n\n#### COI Statement\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n**Disclaimer:** AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

The results were presented today, in collaboration with Regeneron, for the first time at the 2024 European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency was the first regulatory authority in the world to approve Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled COPD characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Specifically, the approval covers patients already on a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), or on a combination of a LABA and a LAMA if ICS is not appropriate. Dupixent has also been approved by ANVISA (the Brazilian health regulatory agency) and the Russian Ministry of Health for certain adults with uncontrolled COPD associated with type 2 inflammation. Regulatory submissions are under review with other authorities around the world, including in the US, China, and Japan.\n\n**_Surya Bhatt, M.D., MSPH_**  \nProfessor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, US, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, and a co-principal investigator of the study  \n_“For far too long, I have watched patients with uncontrolled COPD struggle with a relentless cycle of exacerbations that diminish lung function, with no new treatment approaches to help alleviate this downward spiral. The pooled analysis of the pivotal BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies provide more comprehensive examination of the unprecedented efficacy and safety data, which reinforce the benefit of dupilumab for patients on maximal inhaled therapy and limited additional options.”_\n\nAs presented, this pooled analysis reinforces previous positive results from the BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies. All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (with nearly all on triple therapy). Dupixent patients (n=938) achieved the following compared to placebo (n=936):\n\n*   31% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (nominal p<0.0001).\n*   Improvement in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV1) from baseline by 147 mL compared to 64 mL at 12 weeks (nominal p<0.0001). These improvements were observed as early as two weeks and sustained at 52 weeks (nominal p<0.0001).\n\nSafety results in this pooled analysis were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 72% for Dupixent and 71% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent than placebo included nasopharyngitis (7.8% Dupixent, 7.4% placebo) and headache (7.8% Dupixent, 6.6%placebo). AEs leading to deaths were 2% for Dupixent and 1.6% for placebo.\n\nThe potential use of Dupixent and its safety and efficacy in COPD have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authorities outside of the EU, Brazil, and Russia.\n\n**About COPD**  \nCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough, excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities, which may lead to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD, but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. Prior to the approval of Dupixent in the EU, there had been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade.\n\n**About the Dupixent COPD phase 3 study program**  \nBOREAS and NOTUS were replicate, randomized, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation, as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per µL. The trials enrolled 1,874 patients who were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS.\n\nDuring the 52-week treatment period, patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of ICS, LABA and LAMA. Double maintenance therapy, which included LABA and LAMA, was allowed if ICS was not appropriate.\n\nThe primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks, change from baseline at 52 weeks in St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire total score compared to placebo, change from baseline at 52 weeks in Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD total score compared to placebo, and safety.\n\nThe p-values for the pooled analysis were nominal because there was no hierarchical testing procedure for the pooled data.\n\n**About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD clinical research program**  \nSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics, Dupixent and itepekimab.\n\nDupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL33), an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.\n\nItepekimab is currently under clinical investigation in two phase 3 studies, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\n**About Dupixent**  \nDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies, establishing that IL4 and IL13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.\n\nDupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and COPD in different age populations. More than 900,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.\n\n**Dupilumab development program**  \nDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.\n\nIn addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies, including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\n_About Sanofi_  \nWe are an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Although Sanofi’s management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Sanofi, that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include among other things, unexpected regulatory actions or delays, or government regulation generally, that could affect the availability or commercial potential of the product, the fact that product may not be commercially successful, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including future clinical data and analysis of existing clinical data relating to the product, including post marketing, unexpected safety, quality or manufacturing issues, competition in general, risks associated with intellectual property and any related future litigation and the ultimate outcome of such litigation, and volatile economic and market conditions, and the impact that pandemics or other global crises may have on us, our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and the financial condition of any one of them, as well as on our employees and on the global economy as a whole. The risks and uncertainties also include the uncertainties discussed or identified in the public filings with the SEC and the AMF made by Sanofi, including those listed under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Sanofi’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023.

You're not alone! \n\n- A recent study of 419 adults at a London headache service revealed that a staggering 63.8% of patients were non-responsive to triptans due to lack of effectiveness or side effects. \n- Interestingly, while oral sumatriptan is the most used, only 24.9% of patients found it effective. On the other hand, eletriptan led to a significantly higher response rate at 49.5%.  \n- The odds of non-response appear to rise with the number of failed preventive medications, notably higher (1.64 times) in those receiving calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies, but dropped for those identified as medication over-users (0.43 times). \n- These findings underscore the need for clinicians to adapt their treatment strategies, potentially considering transitioning to alternative acute medications like gepants or ditans, or advocating for early intervention tactics to enhance efficacy. \n\nWith the prevalence of triptan non-response, how are we as healthcare professionals adapting our approaches to better meet the needs of migraine patients? 🧠 \n\nFor more details, check the study published in Cephalalgia: http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/migraine-when-triptans-dont-work-2024a1000gbr", ['Research & Clinical Trials', 'Neurology', 'PainManagement', 'PatientSafety'], 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/7659900/pexels-photo-7659900.jpeg', 'http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/migraine-when-triptans-dont-work-2024a1000gbr', 'You are a social media content strategist tasked with creating ready-to-use social media posts aimed at healthcare professionals.

"It is imperative for clinicians to explore methods to optimize acute medication efficacy, whether this comprises changing to a triptan with a superior response rate, advocating for early intervention or considering alternative acute medication classes, such as gepants or ditans," they added.\n\nSOURCE:\n-------\n\nThe study was led by Robyn-Jenia Wilcha, MBChB Medicine (Hons), King\'s College London, London, UK, and was published online in Cephalalgia.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n------------\n\nLimitations included study of a population more severely affected by migraine, exclusion of certain groups (those with additional headache disorders or psychiatric illness, and pregnant women), possible misclassification and confounding, and potential recall bias among clinicians providing study data.\n\nDISCLOSURES:\n------------\n\nThe study was funded in part by the National Institute for Health and Care Research Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. One author disclosed affiliations with companies that manufacture triptans and/or other drugs used to treat migraine.\n\nReferences\n\nWilcha RJ, Goadsby PJ.

Indeed, a 2022 YouGov poll found that 67% of patient-facing NHS workers experience aggression from a patient at least once a year.1 These interactions are seen by many as part of the emotional toll of patient care, contributing to both burnout in the profession and the breakdown of relationships with patients.\n\nAt a personal level, difficult consultations with emotionally dysregulated patients can make me feel drained and baffled, even though I have had training in conflict resolution and consider it part of my skillset. It is easy for these situations to escalate, and it seems like nobody wins when this happens: neither the staff who are trying to help, nor the patients who are trying to convey a message of frustration.\n\nThis article discusses how to approach situations in which a patient is agitated or aggressive in a way that de-escalates the situation and facilitates more effective communication and a better rapport between clinicians and patients. Emphasis is also given to stress-response mechanisms and the possible underlying causes of such behaviours; in many cases, aggression will be a clinical sign of a developmental or acquired difference—such as autism, adverse childhood experiences, or post-traumatic stress disorder—or another condition that can lead to emotional dysregulation.2,3 The article also discusses ways in which clinicians can look after themselves after such interactions, and reduce the associated emotional burden.\n\nHowever, it is important to clarify that this article concerns rudeness and frustrated communication, not violence or abuse. Violence and abuse are never acceptable, and I agree with a zero-tolerance policy in the NHS as for any other work environment. Unfortunately, violence in the workplace does still happen despite these policies, and as many as 30% of patient-facing NHS workers experience violence from patients at least once a year.1\n\nFactors Underlying Difficult Patient Interactions\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nIn general, patient interactions become difficult because patients experience a number of stressful factors in healthcare settings, including:2,4,5\n\n*   uncertainty\n*   fear\n*   perceived or real threat to life or health\n*   frustration and confusion due to complicated processes in obtaining care\n*   feelings of a lack of control, which may be severe for susceptible individuals.\n\nStressors like these can trigger a stress response in certain individuals—both patients and doctors—that may be stronger than those resulting from usual day-to-day interactions. The individual therefore experiences a ‘fight-or-flight’ response (also known as an acute stress response), in which their verbal communication can become impaired and their emotions more difficult to regulate voluntarily.6,7 Thus, even seemingly small amounts of external stress can have a tremendous impact on how a patient interacts with members of clinical staff.4,5\n\n### The Maladapted Stress Response (Emotional Dysregulation)\n\nNot everyone’s fight-or-flight response is the same. Just as with thresholds for heat or pain, the threshold for triggering an acute stress response varies between individuals, as does the nature of that response (such as in its duration, intensity, or how easily the person can consciously modulate it).6 This stress response—broadly consisting of a faster response mediated by the sympathetic–adrenal–medullary system and a slower response mediated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis7—is necessary for survival in both humans and animals, allowing them to have quicker reaction times, defend from threats, and escape dangerous situations.8,9 The faster, fight-or-flight response is characterised by increased heart rate, heightened senses, a surge of adrenaline and cortisol, creating a boost in energy levels that is normal in appropriate situations.9,10\n\nIssues arise when people develop an inappropriate stress response: they may misinterpret nonthreatening situations as dangerous, be in a constant state of stress response that becomes chronic, or experience a response that is above the threshold that they can tolerate and become repeatedly overwhelmed.8,9 This inappropriate stress response to triggers is often called ‘emotional dysregulation’, defined by the American Psychological Association as an ‘_extreme or inappropriate emotional response to a situation_’;11 it is characteristic of people who have difficulties in understanding and influencing their own emotions.12 This emotional response can often be unpleasant for a person, and may have a negative impact on their relationships.12\n\n#### _Toxic Stress_\xa0\n\nOne factor that often leads to a maladapted stress response is ‘toxic stress’: frequent, chronic stress that has harmful and potentially lasting effects on physical and mental health, such as that caused by abuse or extreme poverty, but that can also arise from internal factors (such as pain or a heightened sensitivity to external stimuli).13 People experiencing toxic stress may have such a dysfunctional fight-or-flight response that they are unable to return to a calm physiological or psychological state and, in the long term, toxic stress can disrupt the neuro-endocrine-immune response, leading to adverse effects such as maladaptive coping skills, poor stress management, unhealthy lifestyles, mental illness, and physical disease.13\n\n### Possible Clinical Causes\xa0\n\nIn many cases, agitated or aggressive behaviour in the clinic will be a clinical sign of a condition or experience that impairs the patient’s executive or cognitive function.3,4,14 The possible clinical causes of a dysfunctional stress response can be physical, neurodevelopmental, environmental, or psychological (see Box 1).2,3,7,15–24 Clinicians should maintain a low threshold of suspicion for these causes in patients who are easily agitated.3,14\n\nApproaching Difficult Patient Interactions\xa0\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAssuming that there is no threat of violence, a clinician’s approach to a consultation with a patient who is being aggressive will have three broad aims: de-escalating the interaction by helping the patient to regulate their emotions; determining the clinical need; and preventing future difficult interactions by helping the patient to deal with their emotional dysregulation.2,4,5,14 In my opinion, two changes in focus are key for facilitating an effective approach of this kind:\n\n*   changing the narrative from one of the ‘volatile patient’ to one of emotional dysregulation and a heightened stress response\n*   understanding that behavioural and communication difficulties are an indication that the situation needs to be addressed differently, and using the person’s behaviour to give clues on how to de-escalate the situation and prevent it recurring in future.\n\n### Confirming and Ruling Out Physical Causes\n\nWhen confronted by a patient who is behaving aggressively, clinicians should consider potential physical causes of their emotional dysregulation (see Box 1),2,3,14 and carry out relevant history taking, examinations, and investigations. Some possible causes include hormonal issues, pain (such as that caused by inflammatory bowel disease, fibromyalgia, or sciatica), and insomnia.2,3,14 If one of these diagnoses is established, the clinician should be able to set out a comprehensive but realistic treatment plan to achieve a reduction in the patient’s discomfort before also exploring other possible psychological triggers.3,5,14 Regardless of whether it is possible to fully resolve the physical issue with the treatments available, clinicians should provide validation of and compassion for the patient’s difficulties in a genuine manner.\n\nIn my experience, once a clinician has identified any other factors that may be affecting the person’s mood, they can more effectively suggest some basic strategies for emotional regulation to the patient. The fact that a patient has reached their adult years—and may even be an older adult—does not mean that they have naturally mastered emotional regulation or social communication.\n\n### Recognising Different Stress Responses\xa0\n\nClinicians should also understand that emotional dysregulation can take different forms, as this will help them to identify when a patient is experiencing emotional dysregulation and use their findings to inform any coping strategies and therapeutic interventions that the patient may need. The fight-or-flight response is not universal, and the modern understanding of stress responses is growing to include several other types that reflect a broader range of reactions to threat and stress (see Box 2).25–27\n\n### The Consultation: De-escalating and Understanding\n\nWhen confronted with a patient who is behaving aggressively, clinicians should perform the following essential actions:3–5,14,28,29\n\n*   make their own safety and that of their team the first priority—if any team member is not safe, do not approach the situation\n*   remain calm and use compassionate language, active listening techniques, and validation to explore the person’s grievances, while establishing healthy boundaries\n    *   in appropriate situations, use neurodivergence-friendly and trauma-infomed approaches (see _Adapting to Neurodivergence and Trauma_)\n*   start with the mindset that the patient's feelings are important and valid, even if team members don’t share the same point of view\n*   be patient—it may take a minute or more of active listening time before the issue starts to make sense\n*   if the clinician really can't achieve this understanding for any reason, it may be better to get another team member to address the situation, if possible.\n\nClinicians should listen and ask for clarification until they understand the situation, avoiding the urge to jump in with suggestions.4,5 It may help to give positive reinforcement if the patient is able to verbalise their concerns, even if they do it in an agitated or haphazard way.4,5 This could be by thanking the patient for raising the issue, or by offering an empathetic comment. Before giving an opinion, it may also be useful to ask the patient (in a noncondescending manner) for their opinion on what form they would prefer the clinician’s help to take. This allows the patient to feel understood and that they have some control of the situation.\n\nIf de-escalation cannot be achieved and the patient continues to behave aggressively, end the interaction (if necessary, following the practice’s safety procedures).4,14 Once the clinician is safe, they should ensure that other team members are safe, and get help as needed—for example, by calling an ambulance or contacting an acute mental health team or the police. In addition, healthcare practitioners should consider whether the patient and their family are safe: if they behaved this way in a healthcare setting, are vulnerable household members at risk? If the patient stormed out of the practice, is there any risk of self-harm or suicide? It may be appropriate to arrange a follow-up welfare check by a neutral member of staff or the police.\n\nClinicians who can learn to keep their own stress response low and remain calm and compassionate despite having an animated patient in front of them will be more able to create a space for external regulation of the patient and discussion of their issue.2,5 This calmness can often be conveyed in a nonverbal manner, with a friendly tone of voice, a genuine smile, and warm behaviour directed towards the patient.2,3,5,14 Clinicians can let the patient feel heard by using their posture, as well as by avoiding full eye contact and adopting a nonthreatening stance.2–5,14\n\nIt may be appropriate to allow the patient to explore their issue by ‘venting’ their frustration for a while,4,5 although time constraints may mean that this process has to be cut short. In my experience, establishing a clear timeframe with the patient lets them know that the clinician has other responsibilities to attend to beyond the consultation. Once the patient has expressed their frustrations without judgement, the patient and doctor may then be able to move forward to more effective communication.\n\n### Adapting to Neurodivergence and Trauma\xa0\n\nSome particularly difficult consultations to negotiate are those in which the patient has suffered severe trauma, is experiencing a toxic stress response, or has been hurt by a person in a position of trust (for example, survivors of domestic violence). These patients may be constantly scanning for threats or looking for any indication from the clinician that they may hurt them, so communication in these consultations needs to be especially calm, compassionate, and nonthreatening, and a trauma-informed approach may be especially beneficial.29,30 Some freely available resources on compassionate language and communication are provided in Box 3.\n\nA greater understanding of neurodivergence may also help clinicians to interact with patients exhibiting certain aggressive or agitated behaviours more effectively, as neurodivergent people benefit from different approaches to communication and healthcare provision.18,28 For example, the common de-escalation advice to ‘maintain eye contact’ may not be comfortable for autistic people, and they may respond negatively to this action.\n\nNeurodivergent-friendly and trauma-informed approaches may therefore be a simple and effective way to improve and avoid some difficult consultations. These approaches differ from the more traditional, authoritative stance epitomised by Dr James Groves’ widely cited 1978 article _Taking care of the hateful patient_,31 which has been criticised for presenting a pessimistic and divisive approach and belittling patients.32 In my opinion, such an approach may well establish boundaries, but is not conducive to a positive patient–doctor relationship.\n\nSometimes, for neurodivergent individuals, social expectations such as maintaining a lower tone of voice to avoid interfering with other consultations may not be obvious, so clinicians should explain this calmly and set healthy boundaries, while respecting neurodivergent traits like nonlinear communication or fidgeting during talking.28 Also, clinicians should learn about other features of neurodivergence that could be misinterpreted as a negative interaction28—for example, understanding that constant interruptions are not meant to be disrespectful, but are almost impossible for some individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder to control.\n\n### What Guidance Is Available?\n\nNICE’s 2015 guidance on this topic, _Violence and aggression: short-term management in mental health, health and community settings_, is aimed towards the management of patients with mental illness, but its recommendations are still useful for the management of patients with no known mental illness.33 The Medical Defence Union,4 the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland,5 and the NHS website34 also provide some useful information on how to deal with aggressive behaviour.\n\nThere is a lot of information freely available on this topic from other sources—including in conflict-resolution courses aimed at healthcare professionals and in resources produced for individual practices, primary care networks, and integrated care systems. Clinicians should be careful with some of these resources, however, as in my experience many of them are still heavily influenced by Groves’ approach.\n\nFurther tips on handling aggressive behaviour is available in a [short video](https://youtu.be/4jUP4NctX8E?si=Mymu3jMLp4aorAgf).\n\nHow Difficult Interactions Impact Healthcare Professionals\xa0\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is also important to recognise the real impact of these harder-than-average interactions on healthcare practitioners—in both the short and long term. If not addressed, repeated stressful interactions with patients can contribute to job dissatisfaction and burnout, affecting not only the healthcare professional, but also their private and professional networks.2,35\n\nBurnout rates in healthcare are notably higher than in other professions in the UK, and various bodies—including the General Medical Council—have reported that stress and burnout among doctors in the UK have reached unprecedented levels, exacerbated by long hours, high patient loads, and the emotional toll of patient care.36–38 The intensity and demands of healthcare roles contribute to this discrepancy significantly.\n\nHowever, learning how to help patients to better regulate their emotions can actually give the healthcare professional a sense of achievement that extends beyond the consultation. In my experience, when dysregulated patients respond well to a clinician’s approach, both the patient and the clinician feel encouraged to share the strategies of regulation with colleagues, children, parents, friends, and partners, creating a beneficial ‘ripple effect’. Especially in general practice, where clinicians are not only treating single patients but whole family groups, the benefits of intervention for one patient can be reflected in other patients on the list.\n\nAfter developing an understanding of emotional dysregulation in the healthcare setting, clinicians will hopefully also be able to extrapolate their learning and use this information in other day-to-day interactions, both in and out of the workplace.\n\n### Safeguarding The Healthcare Professional’s Emotional State\xa0\n\nAt certain moments, a clinician may not be in the best position to deal with a difficult consultation, such as when they are tired, hungry, frustrated, or burnt out. It is perfectly understandable that a clinician may need a break for self-care, either before a potentially difficult consultation or after one.\n\nBy investing in understanding one’s own mental state, clinicians can become more able to deal with the high-energy emotions that may flow in consultations with a patient experiencing emotional dysregulation.2,14 Box 4 details some books and podcasts that clinicians in particular situations may find useful.\n\nClinicians themselves may have experienced trauma as a result of childhood, work, or life experiences; thus, learning about and implementing trauma-informed healthcare approaches can help practitioners to avoid retraumatising themselves and subsequent mental ill health and burnout.\n\nTo avoid further trauma to patients and clinicians, there is a need for more trauma-informed approaches to healthcare in UK general practice. Organisations and colleagues should be supported in creating a culture of mutual compassion and understanding to allow better healthcare for all.\n\nMore information on trauma-informed healthcare can be found on the [Trauma-informed approaches in health care (TAP CARE) study web page](https://www.bistol.ac.uk/primaryhealthcare/researchthemes/tapcare/).\n\nWhy Consider Using a Different Approach?\xa0\n-----------------------------------------\n\n### Improving Patient–Doctor Relationships and Patient Outcomes\xa0\n\nThe relationship between a patient and their healthcare provider is critical for effective diagnosis, treatment adherence, and overall patient satisfaction.39–41 A poor patient–doctor relationship can significantly impact health outcomes, leading to several adverse effects.39,40 Box 5 lists some key ways in which a poor rapport can affect outcomes, emphasising the importance of good communication and positive relationships.39–45\n\nSummary\xa0\n--------\n\nConsultations with people exhibiting aggressive and agitated behaviour can be extremely taxing for clinicians, but they can also be rewarding when they end well. To get them right, clinicians must improve communication skills, foster empathy, and build trust within the patient–doctor relationship, challenging noncompassionate techniques they might have learned or used in the past. Training healthcare providers in these areas and creating a supportive environment for patients to express their concerns can lead to better health outcomes and enhanced patient satisfaction.", 'gpt-4o-mini']

Recent insights highlight a significant gap between healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients' experiences with corticosteroid use in IBD management.\n\nHere are some vital takeaways:\n- A comprehensive study involving over 4400 patients revealed that 69.7% reported corticosteroid exposure, with prednisolone being far more commonly linked to adverse effects compared to budesonide.\n- Alarmingly, adverse events (AEs) associated with corticosteroid use have surged from 2008 to 2019, indicating a growing safety concern that we must address.\n- Most notably, patients reported significant weight gain and heightened risk of various complications, like adrenal insufficiency and osteoporosis, particularly among those taking prednisolone beyond 12 weeks.\n- The findings advocate for limiting corticosteroid usage to acute flare management while exploring alternative IBD treatments to minimize long-term exposure.\n- A crucial recommendation is to give special consideration to young female patients and those with mental health issues before initiating corticosteroid therapy.\n\nAs we reflect on these findings, it's imperative to ask ourselves: How can we integrate routine quality-of-life assessments and mental health queries into our practice to better align with our patients' experiences? 🤔  \n\nExplore the full scope of the study here: http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/and-never-twain-shall-meet-hcps-patients-ibd-2024a1000giz", ['Research & Clinical Trials', 'HealthcareInnovation', 'PatientSafety', 'ClinicalTrials', 'Gastroenterology'], 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/3970333/pexels-photo-3970333.jpeg', 'http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/and-never-twain-shall-meet-hcps-patients-ibd-2024a1000giz', 'You are a social media content strategist tasked with creating ready-to-use social media posts aimed at healthcare professionals. Summarize key takeaways from a webpage scraping, ensuring the content is trustworthy and relevant. Present the information in a concise, bullet-point format, emphasizing actionable insights and recent updates relevant to clinical practice, while maintaining varied and engaging structures. The tone should be professional yet conversational to sustain interest, using reflective phrasing and deeper insight.\n\nKey Instructions:\n\n\t-\tDynamic Openings: Vary post introductions (e.g., posing questions, sharing surprising facts, or introducing patient scenarios). Avoid repetitive phrases like “New Insights.”\n\t-\tProfessional but Engaging Tone: Use reflective language, nuanced phrasing, and sentence variety to keep the post fresh. Balance professionalism with conversational engagement.\n\t-\tEmojis for Emphasis: Use emojis sparingly to emphasize key points or statistics, ensuring they fit the professional tone.

"Additional consideration should be given to young, female patients and those with a history of mental health disorders before prescribing corticosteroids," they added.\n\nSOURCE:\n-------\n\nThe study was led by Eman Al Sulais, Cambridge University Hospitals, Cambridge, UK, and appeared online in the Journal of Crohn\'s and Colitis.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n------------\n\nLimitations included a retrospective/descriptive design, potential over/under AE reporting, missing data, false causality attributions, missing confounders, recall bias, and a limited generalisability.\n\nDISCLOSURES:\n------------\n\nThe study was funded by AbbVie, Inc.

Delays in diagnosis can significantly affect patient outcomes, so consider implementing routine screenings for those at risk.  \n\nIn light of these findings, how might your approach to monitoring patients with mild psoriasis evolve? Let's discuss!  \n\nFor more details, check out the full study here: https://www.jrheum.org/content/early/2024/08/24/jrheum.2024-0556.long", ['Research & Clinical Trials', 'HealthTech', 'ClinicalTrials', 'Dermatology', 'Rheumatology', 'PatientSafety'], 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/5752257/pexels-photo-5752257.jpeg', 'http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/psoriasis-will-it-progress-arthritis-2024a1000giv', 'You are a social media content strategist tasked with creating ready-to-use social media posts aimed at healthcare professionals.

Hence, accurate estimates of the incidence of psoriatic arthritis in populations targeted for screening are highly desirable," the authors wrote. "Extended follow-up of the TUDOR cohort with accrual of larger numbers of incident cases will allow risk factors for psoriatic arthritis to be explored in more depth," they added.\n\nSOURCE:\n-------\n\nThe study was led by Alex Rudge, MD, University of Bath, Bath, UK, and was [published online](https://www.jrheum.org/content/early/2024/08/24/jrheum.2024-0556.long) in the _Journal of Rheumatology._\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n------------\n\nLimitations included the fairly short follow-up, lack of power to explore risk factors, and uncertain generalisability to all patients managed in primary care.\n\nDISCLOSURES:\n------------\n\nThe study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. The authors reported no conflicts of interest.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

A pooled analysis from the BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies showed that Dupixent reduced exacerbations and improved lung function compared to placebo in adults with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e., raised blood eosinophils). The results were presented today, in collaboration with Regeneron, for the first time at the 2024 European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency was the first regulatory authority in the world to approve Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled COPD characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Specifically, the approval covers patients already on a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), or on a combination of a LABA and a LAMA if ICS is not appropriate. Dupixent has also been approved by ANVISA (the Brazilian health regulatory agency) and the Russian Ministry of Health for certain adults with uncontrolled COPD associated with type 2 inflammation. Regulatory submissions are under review with other authorities around the world, including in the US, China, and Japan.\n\nSurya Bhatt, M.D., MSPH  \nProfessor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, US, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, and a co-principal investigator of the study  \n“For far too long, I have watched patients with uncontrolled COPD struggle with a relentless cycle of exacerbations that diminish lung function, with no new treatment approaches to help alleviate this downward spiral. The pooled analysis of the pivotal BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies provide more comprehensive examination of the unprecedented efficacy and safety data, which reinforce the benefit of dupilumab for patients on maximal inhaled therapy and limited additional options.”\n\nAs presented, this pooled analysis reinforces previous positive results from the BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies. All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (with nearly all on triple therapy). Dupixent patients (n=938) achieved the following compared to placebo (n=936):\n\n* 31% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (nominal p<0.0001).  \n* Improvement in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV1) from baseline by 147 mL compared to 64 mL at 12 weeks (nominal p<0.0001). These improvements were observed as early as two weeks and sustained at 52 weeks (nominal p<0.0001).\n\nSafety results in this pooled analysis were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 72% for Dupixent and 71% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent than placebo included nasopharyngitis (7.8% Dupixent, 7.4% placebo) and headache (7.8% Dupixent, 6.6% placebo). AEs leading to deaths were 2% for Dupixent and 1.6% for placebo.\n\nThe potential use of Dupixent and its safety and efficacy in COPD have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authorities outside of the EU, Brazil, and Russia.\n\nAbout COPD  \nCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough, excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities, which may lead to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD, but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. Prior to the approval of Dupixent in the EU, there had been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade.\n\nAbout the Dupixent COPD phase 3 study program  \nBOREAS and NOTUS were replicate, randomized, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation, as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per µL. The trials enrolled 1,874 patients who were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS.\n\nDuring the 52-week treatment period, patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of ICS, LABA and LAMA. Double maintenance therapy, which included LABA and LAMA, was allowed if ICS was not appropriate.\n\nThe primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks, change from baseline at 52 weeks in St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire total score compared to placebo, change from baseline at 52 weeks in Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD total score compared to placebo, and safety.\n\nThe p-values for the pooled analysis were nominal because there was no hierarchical testing procedure for the pooled data.\n\nAbout Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD clinical research program  \nSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics, Dupixent and itepekimab.\n\nDupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL33), an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.\n\nItepekimab is currently under clinical investigation in two phase 3 studies, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\nAbout Dupixent  \nDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies, establishing that IL4 and IL13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.\n\nDupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and COPD in different age populations. More than 900,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.\n\nDupilumab development program  \nDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.\n\nIn addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies, including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\nAbout Sanofi  \nWe are an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Indeed, a 2022 YouGov poll found that 67% of patient-facing NHS workers experience aggression from a patient at least once a year.1 These interactions are seen by many as part of the emotional toll of patient care, contributing to both burnout in the profession and the breakdown of relationships with patients.\n\nAt a personal level, difficult consultations with emotionally dysregulated patients can make me feel drained and baffled, even though I have had training in conflict resolution and consider it part of my skillset. It is easy for these situations to escalate, and it seems like nobody wins when this happens: neither the staff who are trying to help, nor the patients who are trying to convey a message of frustration.\n\nThis article discusses how to approach situations in which a patient is agitated or aggressive in a way that de-escalates the situation and facilitates more effective communication and a better rapport between clinicians and patients. Emphasis is also given to stress-response mechanisms and the possible underlying causes of such behaviours; in many cases, aggression will be a clinical sign of a developmental or acquired difference—such as autism, adverse childhood experiences, or post-traumatic stress disorder—or another condition that can lead to emotional dysregulation.2,3 The article also discusses ways in which clinicians can look after themselves after such interactions, and reduce the associated emotional burden.\n\nHowever, it is important to clarify that this article concerns rudeness and frustrated communication, not violence or abuse. Violence and abuse are never acceptable, and I agree with a zero-tolerance policy in the NHS as for any other work environment. Unfortunately, violence in the workplace does still happen despite these policies, and as many as 30% of patient-facing NHS workers experience violence from patients at least once a year.1\n\nFactors Underlying Difficult Patient Interactions\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nIn general, patient interactions become difficult because patients experience a number of stressful factors in healthcare settings, including:2,4,5\n\n*   uncertainty\n*   fear\n*   perceived or real threat to life or health\n*   frustration and confusion due to complicated processes in obtaining care\n*   feelings of a lack of control, which may be severe for susceptible individuals.\n\nStressors like these can trigger a stress response in certain individuals—both patients and doctors—that may be stronger than those resulting from usual day-to-day interactions. The individual therefore experiences a ‘fight-or-flight’ response (also known as an acute stress response), in which their verbal communication can become impaired and their emotions more difficult to regulate voluntarily.6,7 Thus, even seemingly small amounts of external stress can have a tremendous impact on how a patient interacts with members of clinical staff.4,5\n\n### The Maladapted Stress Response (Emotional Dysregulation)\n\nNot everyone’s fight-or-flight response is the same. Just as with thresholds for heat or pain, the threshold for triggering an acute stress response varies between individuals, as does the nature of that response (such as in its duration, intensity, or how easily the person can consciously modulate it).6 This stress response—broadly consisting of a faster response mediated by the sympathetic–adrenal–medullary system and a slower response mediated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis7—is necessary for survival in both humans and animals, allowing them to have quicker reaction times, defend from threats, and escape dangerous situations.8,9 The faster, fight-or-flight response is characterised by increased heart rate, heightened senses, a surge of adrenaline and cortisol, creating a boost in energy levels that is normal in appropriate situations.9,10\n\nIssues arise when people develop an inappropriate stress response: they may misinterpret nonthreatening situations as dangerous, be in a constant state of stress response that becomes chronic, or experience a response that is above the threshold that they can tolerate and become repeatedly overwhelmed.8,9 This inappropriate stress response to triggers is often called ‘emotional dysregulation’, defined by the American Psychological Association as an ‘_extreme or inappropriate emotional response to a situation_’;11 it is characteristic of people who have difficulties in understanding and influencing their own emotions.12 This emotional response can often be unpleasant for a person, and may have a negative impact on their relationships.12\n\n#### _Toxic Stress_\xa0\n\nOne factor that often leads to a maladapted stress response is ‘toxic stress’: frequent, chronic stress that has harmful and potentially lasting effects on physical and mental health, such as that caused by abuse or extreme poverty, but that can also arise from internal factors (such as pain or a heightened sensitivity to external stimuli).13 People experiencing toxic stress may have such a dysfunctional fight-or-flight response that they are unable to return to a calm physiological or psychological state and, in the long term, toxic stress can disrupt the neuro-endocrine-immune response, leading to adverse effects such as maladaptive coping skills, poor stress management, unhealthy lifestyles, mental illness, and physical disease.13\n\n### Possible Clinical Causes\xa0\n\nIn many cases, agitated or aggressive behaviour in the clinic will be a clinical sign of a condition or experience that impairs the patient’s executive or cognitive function.3,4,14 The possible clinical causes of a dysfunctional stress response can be physical, neurodevelopmental, environmental, or psychological (see Box 1).2,3,7,15–24 Clinicians should maintain a low threshold of suspicion for these causes in patients who are easily agitated.3,14\n\nApproaching Difficult Patient Interactions\xa0\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAssuming that there is no threat of violence, a clinician’s approach to a consultation with a patient who is being aggressive will have three broad aims: de-escalating the interaction by helping the patient to regulate their emotions; determining the clinical need; and preventing future difficult interactions by helping the patient to deal with their emotional dysregulation.2,4,5,14 In my opinion, two changes in focus are key for facilitating an effective approach of this kind:\n\n*   changing the narrative from one of the ‘volatile patient’ to one of emotional dysregulation and a heightened stress response\n*   understanding that behavioural and communication difficulties are an indication that the situation needs to be addressed differently, and using the person’s behaviour to give clues on how to de-escalate the situation and prevent it recurring in future.\n\n### Confirming and Ruling Out Physical Causes\n\nWhen confronted by a patient who is behaving aggressively, clinicians should consider potential physical causes of their emotional dysregulation (see Box 1),2,3,14 and carry out relevant history taking, examinations, and investigations. Some possible causes include hormonal issues, pain (such as that caused by inflammatory bowel disease, fibromyalgia, or sciatica), and insomnia.2,3,14 If one of these diagnoses is established, the clinician should be able to set out a comprehensive but realistic treatment plan to achieve a reduction in the patient’s discomfort before also exploring other possible psychological triggers.3,5,14 Regardless of whether it is possible to fully resolve the physical issue with the treatments available, clinicians should provide validation of and compassion for the patient’s difficulties in a genuine manner.\n\nIn my experience, once a clinician has identified any other factors that may be affecting the person’s mood, they can more effectively suggest some basic strategies for emotional regulation to the patient. The fact that a patient has reached their adult years—and may even be an older adult—does not mean that they have naturally mastered emotional regulation or social communication.\n\n### Recognising Different Stress Responses\xa0\n\nClinicians should also understand that emotional dysregulation can take different forms, as this will help them to identify when a patient is experiencing emotional dysregulation and use their findings to inform any coping strategies and therapeutic interventions that the patient may need. The fight-or-flight response is not universal, and the modern understanding of stress responses is growing to include several other types that reflect a broader range of reactions to threat and stress (see Box 2).25–27\n\n### The Consultation: De-escalating and Understanding\n\nWhen confronted with a patient who is behaving aggressively, clinicians should perform the following essential actions:3–5,14,28,29\n\n*   make their own safety and that of their team the first priority—if any team member is not safe, do not approach the situation\n*   remain calm and use compassionate language, active listening techniques, and validation to explore the person’s grievances, while establishing healthy boundaries\n    *   in appropriate situations, use neurodivergence-friendly and trauma-infomed approaches (see _Adapting to Neurodivergence and Trauma_)\n*   start with the mindset that the patient's feelings are important and valid, even if team members don’t share the same point of view\n*   be patient—it may take a minute or more of active listening time before the issue starts to make sense\n*   if the clinician really can't achieve this understanding for any reason, it may be better to get another team member to address the situation, if possible.\n\nClinicians should listen and ask for clarification until they understand the situation, avoiding the urge to jump in with suggestions.4,5 It may help to give positive reinforcement if the patient is able to verbalise their concerns, even if they do it in an agitated or haphazard way.4,5 This could be by thanking the patient for raising the issue, or by offering an empathetic comment. Before giving an opinion, it may also be useful to ask the patient (in a noncondescending manner) for their opinion on what form they would prefer the clinician’s help to take. This allows the patient to feel understood and that they have some control of the situation.\n\nIf de-escalation cannot be achieved and the patient continues to behave aggressively, end the interaction (if necessary, following the practice’s safety procedures).4,14 Once the clinician is safe, they should ensure that other team members are safe, and get help as needed—for example, by calling an ambulance or contacting an acute mental health team or the police. In addition, healthcare practitioners should consider whether the patient and their family are safe: if they behaved this way in a healthcare setting, are vulnerable household members at risk? If the patient stormed out of the practice, is there any risk of self-harm or suicide? It may be appropriate to arrange a follow-up welfare check by a neutral member of staff or the police.\n\nClinicians who can learn to keep their own stress response low and remain calm and compassionate despite having an animated patient in front of them will be more able to create a space for external regulation of the patient and discussion of their issue.2,5 This calmness can often be conveyed in a nonverbal manner, with a friendly tone of voice, a genuine smile, and warm behaviour directed towards the patient.2,3,5,14 Clinicians can let the patient feel heard by using their posture, as well as by avoiding full eye contact and adopting a nonthreatening stance.2–5,14\n\nIt may be appropriate to allow the patient to explore their issue by ‘venting’ their frustration for a while,4,5 although time constraints may mean that this process has to be cut short. In my experience, establishing a clear timeframe with the patient lets them know that the clinician has other responsibilities to attend to beyond the consultation. Once the patient has expressed their frustrations without judgement, the patient and doctor may then be able to move forward to more effective communication.\n\n### Adapting to Neurodivergence and Trauma\xa0\n\nSome particularly difficult consultations to negotiate are those in which the patient has suffered severe trauma, is experiencing a toxic stress response, or has been hurt by a person in a position of trust (for example, survivors of domestic violence). These patients may be constantly scanning for threats or looking for any indication from the clinician that they may hurt them, so communication in these consultations needs to be especially calm, compassionate, and nonthreatening, and a trauma-informed approach may be especially beneficial.29,30 Some freely available resources on compassionate language and communication are provided in Box 3.\n\nA greater understanding of neurodivergence may also help clinicians to interact with patients exhibiting certain aggressive or agitated behaviours more effectively, as neurodivergent people benefit from different approaches to communication and healthcare provision.18,28 For example, the common de-escalation advice to ‘maintain eye contact’ may not be comfortable for autistic people, and they may respond negatively to this action.\n\nNeurodivergent-friendly and trauma-informed approaches may therefore be a simple and effective way to improve and avoid some difficult consultations. These approaches differ from the more traditional, authoritative stance epitomised by Dr James Groves’ widely cited 1978 article _Taking care of the hateful patient_,31 which has been criticised for presenting a pessimistic and divisive approach and belittling patients.32 In my opinion, such an approach may well establish boundaries, but is not conducive to a positive patient–doctor relationship.\n\nSometimes, for neurodivergent individuals, social expectations such as maintaining a lower tone of voice to avoid interfering with other consultations may not be obvious, so clinicians should explain this calmly and set healthy boundaries, while respecting neurodivergent traits like nonlinear communication or fidgeting during talking.28 Also, clinicians should learn about other features of neurodivergence that could be misinterpreted as a negative interaction28—for example, understanding that constant interruptions are not meant to be disrespectful, but are almost impossible for some individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder to control.\n\n### What Guidance Is Available?\n\nNICE’s 2015 guidance on this topic, _Violence and aggression: short-term management in mental health, health and community settings_, is aimed towards the management of patients with mental illness, but its recommendations are still useful for the management of patients with no known mental illness.33 The Medical Defence Union,4 the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland,5 and the NHS website34 also provide some useful information on how to deal with aggressive behaviour.\n\nThere is a lot of information freely available on this topic from other sources—including in conflict-resolution courses aimed at healthcare professionals and in resources produced for individual practices, primary care networks, and integrated care systems. Clinicians should be careful with some of these resources, however, as in my experience many of them are still heavily influenced by Groves’ approach.\n\nFurther tips on handling aggressive behaviour is available in a [short video](https://youtu.be/4jUP4NctX8E?si=Mymu3jMLp4aorAgf).\n\nHow Difficult Interactions Impact Healthcare Professionals\xa0\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is also important to recognise the real impact of these harder-than-average interactions on healthcare practitioners—in both the short and long term. If not addressed, repeated stressful interactions with patients can contribute to job dissatisfaction and burnout, affecting not only the healthcare professional, but also their private and professional networks.2,35\n\nBurnout rates in healthcare are notably higher than in other professions in the UK, and various bodies—including the General Medical Council—have reported that stress and burnout among doctors in the UK have reached unprecedented levels, exacerbated by long hours, high patient loads, and the emotional toll of patient care.36–38 The intensity and demands of healthcare roles contribute to this discrepancy significantly.\n\nHowever, learning how to help patients to better regulate their emotions can actually give the healthcare professional a sense of achievement that extends beyond the consultation. In my experience, when dysregulated patients respond well to a clinician’s approach, both the patient and the clinician feel encouraged to share the strategies of regulation with colleagues, children, parents, friends, and partners, creating a beneficial ‘ripple effect’. Especially in general practice, where clinicians are not only treating single patients but whole family groups, the benefits of intervention for one patient can be reflected in other patients on the list.\n\nAfter developing an understanding of emotional dysregulation in the healthcare setting, clinicians will hopefully also be able to extrapolate their learning and use this information in other day-to-day interactions, both in and out of the workplace.\n\n### Safeguarding The Healthcare Professional’s Emotional State\xa0\n\nAt certain moments, a clinician may not be in the best position to deal with a difficult consultation, such as when they are tired, hungry, frustrated, or burnt out. It is perfectly understandable that a clinician may need a break for self-care, either before a potentially difficult consultation or after one.\n\nBy investing in understanding one’s own mental state, clinicians can become more able to deal with the high-energy emotions that may flow in consultations with a patient experiencing emotional dysregulation.2,14 Box 4 details some books and podcasts that clinicians in particular situations may find useful.\n\nClinicians themselves may have experienced trauma as a result of childhood, work, or life experiences; thus, learning about and implementing trauma-informed healthcare approaches can help practitioners to avoid retraumatising themselves and subsequent mental ill health and burnout.\n\nTo avoid further trauma to patients and clinicians, there is a need for more trauma-informed approaches to healthcare in UK general practice. Organisations and colleagues should be supported in creating a culture of mutual compassion and understanding to allow better healthcare for all.\n\nMore information on trauma-informed healthcare can be found on the [Trauma-informed approaches in health care (TAP CARE) study web page](https://www.bistol.ac.uk/primaryhealthcare/researchthemes/tapcare/).\n\nWhy Consider Using a Different Approach?\xa0\n-----------------------------------------\n\n### Improving Patient–Doctor Relationships and Patient Outcomes\xa0\n\nThe relationship between a patient and their healthcare provider is critical for effective diagnosis, treatment adherence, and overall patient satisfaction.39–41 A poor patient–doctor relationship can significantly impact health outcomes, leading to several adverse effects.39,40 Box 5 lists some key ways in which a poor rapport can affect outcomes, emphasising the importance of good communication and positive relationships.39–45\n\nSummary\xa0\n--------\n\nConsultations with people exhibiting aggressive and agitated behaviour can be extremely taxing for clinicians, but they can also be rewarding when they end well. To get them right, clinicians must improve communication skills, foster empathy, and build trust within the patient–doctor relationship, challenging noncompassionate techniques they might have learned or used in the past. Training healthcare providers in these areas and creating a supportive environment for patients to express their concerns can lead to better health outcomes and enhanced patient satisfaction.", 'gpt-4o-mini']
