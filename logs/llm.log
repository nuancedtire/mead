In the trial, notable survival benefit was observed—thus, many practices are adopting this as a new standard.\n- Real-world data from clinical experiences indicate that patients have tolerated the combination well, with manageable side effects, which is crucial for maintaining quality of life.\n- Additionally, oncologists report that careful monitoring for adverse events is essential, especially in patients with underlying liver conditions, to mitigate risks associated with immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy.\n\nAs we witness this promising shift in clinical applications, how do you see the role of combination therapies evolving in the management of liver cancer? 🤔\n\nFor a deeper dive into clinical experiences and insights, read more here: https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/using-atezolizumab-bevacizumab-in-practice', ['Life Sciences & BioTech', 'Oncology', 'ClinicalTrials', 'PrecisionMedicine', 'PatientSafety'], 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/6436249/pexels-photo-6436249.jpeg', 'https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/using-atezolizumab-bevacizumab-in-practice', 'You are a social media content strategist tasked with creating ready-to-use social media posts aimed at healthcare professionals.

The reason for the immune response isn’t fully understood, but evidence suggests viral infections may be risk factors. Infection with the [Epstein-Barr virus](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/) (EBV), in particular, is one of the strongest risk factors for the neurodegenerative condition and some studies have found an association between MS and the human herpesvirus-6A. Also, up to 78% of MS patients have antibodies against measles, varicella zoster, and rubella viruses in their spinal fluid.\n\nIt’s believed that, due to some similarities between viral and human molecules, the immune system may mistakenly attack nerve cells when trying to fight a viral infection. This “molecular mimicry” is one proposed mechanism that may explain the association between viruses and a greater risk of MS.\n\nThe rubella virus has several proteins that share similarities with human proteins. One protein from its envelope, called E2, is similar to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), an essential protein in [myelin](https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/), the fatty coating that covers nerve cells and target of immune responses in MS.\n\nThese similarities raise the possibility of a connection between the rubella virus, the immune response against it, and developing MS.\n\nResearchers in Sweden compared blood samples from MS patients and controls collected before the neurological disease’s onset to determine if people who developed MS had signs of a previous rubella infection — determined through the presence of anti-rubella antibodies — before their diagnosis.\n\n“With samples from both the pre-\xadvaccination era and through the different stages of rubella vaccination in Sweden, we explored a unique opportunity to study [the rubella virus] in the field of MS,” the researchers wrote.\n\nThe study included blood samples from 670 MS patients and 670 matched controls. In both groups, female patients represented the majority (84%) and the median age was 25.\n\nThe researchers tested the samples for the presence of antibodies (seropositivity) that targeted the rubella E1 protein, which the virus uses to infect human cells, and their reactivity. More MS patients (93.7%) had anti-E1 antibodies than healthy controls (88.5%), data showed.\n\nWhen patients and controls were divided based on their rubella vaccination status, seropositivity was only significantly higher in MS patients than controls in unvaccinated people, in whom the presence of antibodies indicates a previous rubella infection. After adjusting for factors such as antibodies against other viruses and vitamin D levels, unvaccinated MS patients were four times more likely to have rubella antibodies than unvaccinated controls. No significant differences were observed in vaccinated patients after accounting for the same factors.\n\nThe presence of antibodies in “unvaccinated subjects (i.e., representing rubella infection) was associated with a higher risk of developing MS,” the researchers wrote. “Molecular mimicry is an attractive hypothesis for a possible mechanism behind these findings.”\n\nThe researchers advised caution when interpreting their findings, mainly because the test they used to determine seropositivity can have a lot of false negatives. Also, most of the participants received the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, adding variables that weren’t evaluated in the study.\n\n“Further serological and epidemiological studies are needed to support our findings,” they wrote.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

An earlier interim study readout from the ongoing Phase 3 trial, DIAGNODE-3, is planned to serve as the basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) under the accelerated approval pathway. Results from the interim readout are expected around March 2026.\n\n"We are committed to working at full speed with our partners and in close dialogue with the FDA to seize this unprecedented opportunity of making Diamyd® available to patients as quickly as possible," says Ulf Hannelius, CEO of Diamyd Medical. "The earlier readout from the DIAGNODE-3 trial represents a critical step in this process and our confidence in Diamyd®\'s disease-modifying benefits is boosted by the positive outcome of the recently announced futility analysis. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to ensure that all necessary regulatory requirements are met."\n\nDiamyd Medical recently announced Fast track designation in the U.S. for Diamyd®, and that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has acknowledged that accelerated approval could be sought based on a demonstration of significant treatment-related benefits on C-peptide levels, a measure of endogenous insulin production, in response to Diamyd® administration. The FDA\'s Accelerated approval program allows drugs for serious conditions that fills an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. Using a surrogate endpoint allows the FDA the potential to approve these drugs faster.\n\nTo prepare the BLA under the FDA\'s Accelerated Approval Program, Diamyd Medical plans to conduct an interim study readout, including efficacy data from approximately 170 participants who have completed their 15-month assessment and safety data from additional individuals enrolled in the DIAGNODE-3 trial. The primary endpoint for this analysis will be C-peptide, a surrogate endpoint now recognized by the FDA as reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Following the interim readout, the DIAGNODE-3 trial will continue to follow all enrolled patients until the 24-month end-of-study assessment. To date, 148 patients have been randomized in DIAGNODE-3. The results of the interim study readout are expected around March 2026, the exact time depending on the final number of participants to be included in the readout, followed by submission of a BLA under the accelerated approval pathway.\n\nThe DIAGNODE-3 trial, which is being conducted in eight European countries and the United States, is expected to fully recruit approximately 330 patients by the end of 2025, and all patients are expected to be fully treated before the time the earlier readout is to be performed. The trial focuses on recently diagnosed patients with Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes carrying the HLA DR3-DQ2 genotype; a subgroup of approximately 40% of Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes patients that has been shown to respond to Diamyd® in previous trials.\n\n**About Diamyd Medical**\n\nDiamyd Medical develops precision medicine therapies for the prevention and treatment of Type 1 Diabetes and LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults). Diamyd® is an antigen-specific immunomodulatory therapeutic for the preservation of endogenous insulin production that has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. as well as Fast Track Designation by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of Stage 1, 2 and 3 Type 1 Diabetes. DIAGNODE-3, a confirmatory Phase III trial is actively recruiting patients with recent-onset (Stage 3) Type 1 Diabetes in eight European countries and in the US. Significant results have previously been shown in a large genetically predefined patient group - in a large-scale meta-analysis as well as in the Company\'s prospective European Phase IIb trial, where Diamyd® was administered directly into a superficial lymph node in children and young adults with recently diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes. Injections into a superficial lymphnode can be performed in minutes and are intended to optimize the treatment response. A biomanufacturing facility is under development in Umeå, Sweden, for the manufacture of recombinant GAD65 protein, the active ingredient in the antigen-specific immunotherapy Diamyd®. Diamyd Medical also develops the GABA-based investigational drug Remygen® as a component in the treatments of metabolic diseases. Diamyd Medical is a major shareholder in the stem cell company NextCell Pharma AB and in the artificial intelligence company MainlyAI AB.\n\nDiamyd Medical\'s B-share is traded on Nasdaq First North Growth Market under the ticker DMYD B.

The SMC in Scotland backed NHS use of the drug in October 2023.\n\nThe new NICE recommendation is conditional, meaning that Welireg can be used while more evidence for its efficacy is collected, according to Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE. It comes after NHS England reached a commercial access deal with the manufacturer.\n\nThe appraisal committee heard from patient experts who explained that some people with VHL have a wide variety of debilitating symptoms depending on where the tumours are growing in the body. These include pain, loss of balance and motor skills, loss of vision, breathlessness, coughing, headaches, confusion, severe nausea, and fatigue.\n\nGraham Lovitt, chair of patient advocacy group VHL UK/Ireland, said Welireg has "game-changing potential" and has shown extraordinary results for some patients in trials, including stabilisation of the tumours, reduction in growth, and – in some cases – the eradication of tumours altogether.\n\n"We are delighted by NICE\'s recommendation of belzutifan […] a significant milestone in the fight against this rare disease," he added.

The new mRNA vaccine candidate more effectively limits symptoms and disease duration in non-human primates infected with a lethal strain of mpox.\n\nAlec Freyn, virology researcher at Moderna and co-first author, stated: “This study is the first in a nonhuman primate model where we compare an investigational mRNA mpox vaccine directly to the current standard of care.” He continued: “When we put those vaccines head-to-head in primates, we saw improved responses from the mRNA vaccine in terms of not just protection from survival but also fewer lesions, shorter duration of disease, and less viral shedding in the blood and respiratory tract.”\n\nOriginally designed to combat smallpox, MVA vaccines contained weakened whole viruses. Yet, this weakening means that they provide limited protection compared to other vaccines. The use of mRNA technology enables vaccines to be developed to only include parts of the virus that are most likely to induce a lasting, protective immune response without exposing the person to a whole infectious virus. The investigational mpox mRNA vaccine is composed of four viral antigens that are essential for the virus to attach and enter host cells.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated that mRNA vaccines can prevent lethal mpox infections in nonhuman primates but their ability to lessen disease severity has not been tested. Therefore, to directly compare the investigational mRNA vaccine to MVA vaccines, the team vaccinated six macaques with each vaccine and then exposed them to a lethal strain of mpox virus eight weeks after their initial vaccine dose. Also, they exposed a control group of six unvaccinated animals to mpox. Then, after infection, the researchers monitored the macaque’s health for four weeks and collected blood samples to study their immune response.\n\nDisease severity\n----------------\n\nFive of the unvaccinated control animals did not survive, whereas all 12 vaccinated animals did, regardless of which vaccine was used. The mRNA-vaccinated animals lost less weight and had fewer lesions than MVA-vaccinated animals, despite both vaccines limiting disease severity compared to the control group.\n\nFurthermore, the mRNA vaccine shortened disease duration, measured by the number of days for which the animals showed lesions, by more than 10 days compared to the MVA vaccine. Lower viral loads were in the blood and throat swabs, indicating that it might be more effective at reducing transmission.\n\nJay Hooper, virologist at the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and senior author explained: “With the mRNA technology, we’re able to produce a vaccine that gives quite potent responses with a very tolerable safety profile…We’ve been trying to get a vaccine that will prevent spread like ACAM2000® but without the safety issues. This is showing that mRNA technology might be able to fill that niche.”\n\nImmune response\n---------------\n\nThe mRNA vaccine resulted in a higher number of antibodies and antibodies with more diverse immune functions. Different classes of antibodies that were associated with enhanced viral control and fewer lesions were identified.\n\nFurthermore, the vaccine demonstrated potential to induce cross-immunity to other Orthopoxviruses, whereas the MVA vaccine results in smaller immune responses that are not as strongly neutralising for more remotely related Orthopoxviruses. Serum from the macaques immunised with the mRNA vaccine “neutralised not only mpox but also vaccinia, cowpox, rabbitpox, camelpox, and ectromelia virus,” Freyn said. “We believe that this vaccine may protect from other Orthopoxvirus threats that may emerge in the future.”\n\nNow, Moderna’s mRNA-1769 vaccine is being assessed in a Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT05995275) to determine the safety, tolerability and immune response of a range of doses of mRNA-1769.\n\nThis study was published in Cell.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

In the study, Nucala was added to inhaled maintenance therapy for COPD.\n\nGSK has been studying Nucala in COPD for some time, and in 2017 reported mixed results for the drug in two earlier phase 3 trials called METREX and METREO.\n\nMETREX involved patients with a range of eosinophil levels and showed a statistically significant improvement for Nucala versus placebo on exacerbation rates. However, in METREO – which focused on patients with higher levels only – the difference between the two arms was not significant.\n\nThe company decided to file for approval regardless, but the FDA declined to approve the new indication in 2018, following the advice of an advisory committee, which found that GSK had not proved efficacy. It seems MATINEE will allow GSK to try its luck again.\n\nThe size of the improvement over placebo – which reportedly extended for up to two years in the trial – won\'t be available until the study is presented at a future medical congress, but is strong enough to warrant discussions with regulators about extending the indications for Nucala, according to the pharma group. It has previously suggested approval for COPD could come in the US in the first half of next year.\n\nNucala has been approved to treat severe eosinophilic asthma for almost a decade, and in the interim has had its label extended to include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome.\n\nThe drug remains one of GSK\'s top products, with sales of £856 million ($1.1 billion) in the first half of this year, up 15%. COPD could open up a massive new market for the drug, which still has several years of patent life left before it could face biosimilar competition.\n\nThe lung disease affects more than 300 million people globally, with up to 40% of patients exhibiting type 2 inflammation characterised by a raised blood eosinophil count, which would make them suitable for treatment with Nucala.\n\nElevated eosinophil levels are associated with more severe COPD and a higher rate of exacerbations, the sudden flare-ups in symptoms that signal the progression of the disease and can lead to hospitalisation.\n\nThe MATINEE data comes at a time when options for COPD are on the up, after a decade with no new therapies.\n\nIn July, the European Commission became the first regulator worldwide to approve Sanofi and Regeneron\'s big-selling IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor Dupixent (dupilumab) as a treatment for the progressive lung disease, shortly after Verona Pharma got the go-ahead from the US FDA for its PDE 3/4 inhibitor Ohtuvayre (ensifentrine).\n\nDupixent – which is due for a verdict from the FDA as a COPD therapy later this month – was cleared for adults with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils, while Ohtuvayre can be used in all patients regardless of eosinophil levels.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

The startup behind it, Zoī, promises customers a “360-degree check-up’ — a three-hour series of tests and exams, ranging from blood tests to eye scans through spirometry and gut microbiome analyses.\n\nThe objective? Collect millions of data points on up to 200 biomarkers that are in turn analysed by an AI model, in order to deliver lifestyle recommendations that, promises Zoī, will prevent disease and improve customers’ long-term wellness.\n\n“It’s not about adding years of life, but rather life to years,” says Zoī cofounder — and former special advisor to French president Emmanuel Macron — Ismaël Emélien. “The goal is to learn the body’s ‘user manual’ to prevent illnesses and enable people to live in good health for longer.”\n\nIt’s not for everyone. Membership to Zoī is €3.6k per year, which includes an annual checkup as well as the follow-up recommendations. That’s roughly the cost of a membership to Soho House, says Zoī's CFO Antoine Attali — and the startup's customers usually belong to the same social circles.\n\nThe clinic caters to premium needs, from snacks elaborated by world-famous chef Alain Ducasse to a balneotherapy section modelled on ‘Japanese thermal baths‘, featuring a snow cabin (?) and a mineral bath that is, I am told, “twice as salty as the Dead Sea”.\n\nAttali tells me that in the long-term, Zoī hopes to become accessible to everyone, and that prices will go down to a similar level to your average WiFi subscription.\n\nFor now, though, preventative health remains a hobby of the upper-class. In fact, Zoī's investors are all private individuals; the company’s €20m seed round, which it raised in 2022, included a good number of high-profile billionaires such as Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saadé and Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel.\n\nAnd Zoī is not the only longevity startup appealing to the ultra-rich. Spotify founder Daniel Ek is behind similar ventures, including [Sand Clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-ek-spotify-sand-clinic-longevity-news), where customers can receive full body check-ups and treatments ranging from vacuum therapy to red light saunas — with membership expected to cost between €1,000 and €10,000 a month.\n\nEk is also the founder of healthtech Neko Health, which has built a full-body scanner for health data collection that it says helps doctors detect potential diseases earlier. The company [has a clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/ek-neko-body-scanner-test) and has just opened a new spot in London, right in the middle of Marylebone, where it prices a one-hour scan at £299 — almost double the price of a visit to the Stockholm clinic when it opened in 2023 (€180).\n\nDespite the cost, the proposition seems appealing enough. Neko Health says it already has a waiting list of 22k people; Zoī says it has “around 1k members” to date and is currently carrying out a dozen check-ups per day — but the startup is confident that it can ramp up to reach its maximum capacity of 35k annual check-ups in the next five years.\n\nWhether or not the preventative treatments promised by startups like Zoī, Neko Health and Sand Clinic will ever reach the masses remains to be seen; what seems certain for now is that billionaires won’t get tired of full-body-scanning anytime soon.\n\n![Image 1: A photo of the entrance to Zoï's centre in Paris](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/06145636/Zoi%CC%84_WIP6_%C2%A911h45-HD-4.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThe entrance to Zoï's centre in Paris.

It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nDoccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE).\n\nDoccla’s founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.\n\n“With the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it’s a huge opportunity to scale,” says Ratz.\n\nThe virtual A&E\n\nSweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.\n\nAccording to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.\n\nPatients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.\n\nSo far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it’s adding 1k new patients every month.\n\n“Over time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,” Ratz says.\n\nPartnering with pharma\n\nDoccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).\n\n“We have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,” Ratz says. “This is because we are in very close contact with our patients.”\n\nDoccla says it’s interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he’s seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.\n\nWith 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.\n\nIn one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.\n\n“We can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits — in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,” Ratz says.\n\nDoccla has raised a total of £52m to date.\n\nIn October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.", 'gpt-4o-mini']

To find out, Sifted spoke to VCs at 415 Capital, Sofinnova Partners, MIG Capital and SHS Capital.\n\n### Linus Rieder, principal at 415 Capital\n\n#### Medical Microinstruments (MMI) – Italy\n\nMMI is building surgical robots to help with micro-surgery. Its robotics platform can be used in reconstructive surgery, plastic surgery and head-neck surgery. The startup is looking to solve key issues in microsurgery like the effects of surgeon tremor and reduces the need for microsurgery training.\n\n#### Gradient Denervation Technologies — France\n\nGradient Denervation Technologies is developing a device for treating heart failure patients with associated pulmonary hypertension. As many as half of heart failure patients around the world have elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, which is shown to lead to an increased risk of mortality and hospitalisation. There are no approved drug or device therapies for this group of pulmonary hypertension patients. By using minimally invasive ultrasound to treat hyperactive nerves in the pulmonary arteries, however, the startup’s technology has the potential to treat and help tens of thousands of patients each year.\n\n#### CorWave — France\n\nCorWave's left ventricular assist device (LVAD) mimics the natural heart's function to treat patients with advanced heart failure. This technology enables the device to replicate the heart pulses, reducing the mechanical damage to blood cells common with current LVADs.\n\n### Anne Osdoit, partner at Sofinnova Partners\n\n#### Ganymed Robotics — France\n\nGanymed is working on a robotics platform to assist surgeons with implant placement during knee replacement surgery. The Paris-based company's approach uses computer vision and artificial intelligence to perceive, and extract knowledge from, the surgical environment in a non-invasive manner, removing imaging and registration steps that add time and complexity to knee surgery.\n\n#### Gleamer — France\n\nGleamer is developing AI tools to enhance image interpretation for radiologists. The startup’s main product helps clinicians identify bone trauma at the point of care. Gleamer has achieved multiple regulatory approvals and successfully commercially deployed in both the US and EU.\n\n#### Salvia BioElectronics — The Netherlands\n\nSalvia BioElectronics is developing drug-free neuromodulation therapies — which refers to a group of medical procedures that look to change brain activity by stimulating nerves — for migraines. Salvia's paper-thin implant is designed to be placed under the forehead to reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks by delivering gentle electrical pulses to the nerves associated with the condition. The company is currently in the clinical stage, having received the Breakthrough Device Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which facilitates expedited market access for devices that treat life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating conditions.\n\n### Fei Tian, principal at MIG Capital\n\n#### Artidis — Switzerland\n\nArtidis is developing imaging tools for cancer diagnostics. It combines a nanotechnology device which analyses tissue with a digital data platform to measure the physical characteristics of both tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment. After determining if a tumour is benign or malignant, Artidis’ technology identifies if it will spread to other sites and can help inform chemotherapy and immunotherapy permeability and treatment response.\n\n#### CoreMedic — Switzerland\n\nCoreMedic has developed an implant which treats the heart condition mitral valve regurgitation (MR). The CoreMedic implant can replace ruptured mitral — a part of the heart — in a minimally invasive procedure that is physiological and reproducible, promising long-term clinical benefits.\n\n### Cornelius Maas, partner at SHS Capital\n\n#### Vitestro — The Netherlands\n\nVitestro is developing an autonomous blood drawing device. This innovative device combines robotics and AI to perform blood drawing more efficiently and safely. Over the past year, Vitestro has made significant strides in clinical trials and secured an additional €20m in funding in April. Vitestro’s tool could mean less burden for patients, less work for the medical staff and consequently reduce costs for the healthcare system.\n\n#### Saphenus — Austria\n\nSaphenus is developing sensory feedback systems for prosthetics. Their key product, the Suralis system, provides users of lower-limb prosthetics with the sensation of foot contact, significantly improving balance and gait. Recently, Saphenus received FDA approval with their Suralis systema and received reimbursement status with key German medical insurers.\n\n#### Bluedrop Medical — Ireland\n\nBluedrop Medical is developing a medical device to monitor foot health and prevent diabetic foot ulcers. It looks like a weighing scale and aims to enable early detection of foot ulcers, which can lead to amputation. Bluedrop Medical is a good example of how remote monitoring can replace doctor visits while preventing serious disease progression, improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.", 'gpt-4o-mini']

The fresh funding tops up the startup’s $130m Series C, raised across two rounds in 2021, and takes its total equity funding to $220m.\n\nIt’s the latest in a string of big money raises for European startups developing tech for hospital operating theatres as healthcare systems across the globe scramble to increase efficiency amid staff shortages and the rising costs of treating ageing populations.\n\nCaresyntax will use the funds to scale customer adoption in the US and EMEA region, develop AI applications and finance M&A opportunities.\n\n### AI for hospitals\n\nCaresyntax says it wants to build the “Android” platform for surgery. Its tech uses AI algorithms to make sense of data collected before, during and after an operation to help surgeons improve patient outcomes, spot risks during procedures and reduce hospitals’ surgery costs by improving efficiency and reducing readmissions.\n\nThe company’s platform can pick up on warning signs like drops in heart rate that surgeons might not be aware of during a procedure, for example. It can also streamline operative workflows, inform post-treatment care pathways post-operation and collect 1,000 data points per surgical case.\n\nWhile some surgical robotics solutions in the market only work with certain products, Caresyntax’s platform can plug into any operating room technology to pull together data, according to a company spokesperson.\n\n“Effectively using AI in the operating room requires input from a wide variety of data sources, but today this data exists in silos where it is difficult for clinicians to access and operationalise,” they add.\n\nIf it does what it sets out to do, it’s a big opportunity.\n\nCosts associated with operations account for 30% of healthcare expenditure, a huge sum given that Europe spends 11% of GDP on health.\n\nFounded in 2013 in Germany — Caresyntax also expanded to San Francisco in 2019 — its data platform is currently used in 3k operating rooms globally, in more than 3m surgeries annually, according to the company. 40% of the company’s revenue comes from the Americas and 60% from the EMEA region.\n\n### The rise of smart surgery\n\nThe round comes on the back of a strong 18 months for startups developing tech for the operating theatre.\n\nSince the start of 2023, three of the four biggest medtech raises have all gone to startups building robots to help surgeons.

It began offering GLP-1 drugs as part of its treatment options in the second quarter of this year.\n\n“For us [GLP-1 drugs] are already a strong growth driver,” he says. “The newer GLP-1 class of medications have created real excitement due to their impressive outcomes in weight loss, transforming the treatment options available for those living with obesity.”\n\nWhile treatment involving GLP-1 drugs is currently a small part of Oviva’s overall business — Eberhardt says it’s growing total patient and revenue numbers by “double digit” percentage points year-on-year — the meds could become the startup’s “largest” growth driver in the future, he tells Sifted.\n\n### Riding the wave\n\nOviva’s not alone. There are a slew of startups in Europe looking to tap into the opportunity — many of which have recently shifted operations to focus on selling GLP-1 drugs or provide treatment pathways around the medication, which was first designed to treat diabetes but was later found to be effective at suppressing appetite and helping people lose weight.\n\nIn the last two years GLP-1s have become a go-to weight loss solution popularised by a roster of celebrity users. According to Walmart’s CEO, food sales have fallen as the one in eight adults in the US who have used the meds slim down their buying habits. The drug class has also seen Novo Nordisk overtake luxury fashion brand LVMH as Europe’s most valuable company, propping up Denmark’s GDP in the process.\n\nAll of the attention has got VCs excited, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic have convinced them to get out their chequebook: Danish startup Embla, which prescribes GLP-1 meds alongside ongoing clinical care and lifestyle advice for patients looking to lose weight in its home market and the UK, picked up a €10m Series A in August 2023 a year on from a €3.5m seed round. Swedish startup Yazen, which says it too prescribes GLP-1 drugs in combination with clinical care, also raised €3.1m last summer.\n\nMany startups operating in the GLP-1 space didn’t start life offering them — largely due to launching before the drugs were popularised for weight loss. Ozempic was approved for sale in the US in 2017 and Europe in 2018; Wegovy was approved in the US in 2021 and Europe in 2022.\n\nUK-based Numan, a digital medication and supplements provider founded in 2016, started by selling sexual health treatments; it began prescribing weight loss drugs in 2022. For years the company marketed itself as a “men’s health” brand, but has recently changed that. The company’s website uses images of men and women on its landing page for weight-loss treatments.\n\nYazen, which launched its weight loss service in 2022, initially set out to exclusively target obese men, but broadened its focus before launching to include obesity more generally, after seeing how effective GLP-1 drugs were, says CEO Fredrik Meurling.\n\nMeurling tells Sifted it had hit €14m annual recurring revenue and treated 15k patients by June this year. It’s now active in Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Spain, and has pilot projects in England and Germany.\n\nOther startups like UK-based Manual, which like Numan started out offering men’s sexual health treatments, also started prescribing weight loss medications in 2022.\n\n“[GLP-1 meds] are a game changer,” says Michael Treskow, partner at Eight Roads Ventures, adding it would be “strange” if a startup working in the weight loss space wasn’t looking into how they could add the drugs into their offering.\n\nWhile GLP-1 meds have been part of some treatment courses at Embla since it launched in 2021, the “hype” surrounding the drug class has “opened doors” for the startup, says co-CEO and cofounder Nicholas Syhler — adding that the startup managed to raise its €400k pre-seed round in 2021 just three weeks after incorporation. It’s now gearing up for a fundraise in 2025 and expanding to the US, where it’ll look to target US employers — who pay for the majority of healthcare in the country.\n\n### Kinks in the supply chain\n\nThere are still big questions hanging over European startups in the sector — not least around whether a European GLP-1 startup can raise the kinds of funds needed to hit real scale.\n\nSome of the biggest rounds for startups vending GLP-1 drugs have been in the US, including Calibrate’s $100m in 2021 and Form Health’s $38m in June this year. In Europe, no company selling the drug or treatment pathways around it has raised more than €10m in a single round.\n\nInvestors and founders tell Sifted supply chain issues are part of that problem. Manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand for the drug, and last year, startups in the UK were told by the government to remove Ozempic from sale due to shortages of the drug for diabetics — Manual was still selling past the deadline.\n\nIf a startup's revenues are closely tied to the availability of those drugs, they could be at the mercy of manufacturing capability. But as pharma bolsters production capabilities those issues could diminish, says Christoph Ruedig, partner at Albion VC.\n\n“As there are severe shortages of GLP-1 drugs in Europe (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are prioritising the US as pricing is higher) the opportunity to date in Europe has been limited but growing.”\n\n### Who’ll stump up the cash?\n\nThere’s also a challenge finding the right people to pay, and in Europe, national healthcare providers need to open up to reimbursing startups providing weight loss care, investors say.\n\nWhile Numan’s head of medical Luke Pratsides says that the “success of private sector companies offering GLP-1 [drugs] shows that the public are willing to pay to meet a significant need that is being underserved by the NHS”, many in the sector think that only serving consumers paying out of their own pocket won’t be enough to hit real scale.\n\n“US investors have told us that they will only invest in companies that get on enterprise contracts [selling to whole organisations like health insurers],” says Syhler. “This means proving that they can deliver high-quality and sustainable care — where the economics and outcomes make sense long-term for both patients and payors.”\n\nIn Europe, where the majority of people have their healthcare paid for by the state, hitting scale will likely come down to whether or not companies can get their services reimbursed by national healthcare providers, say some investors.\n\nIn the UK Wegovy is approved for use to manage obesity in the NHS, but it is currently only available through specialist weight management clinics, limiting availability.\n\nOviva is one the few startups that has had its supply of GLP-1 drugs alongside its weight loss platform reimbursed by the NHS — but it had a head start on others, being reimbursed by the organisation long before the rise of weight loss meds, in 2016. Embla co-CEO and cofounder Laust Axelsen tells Sifted that it’s in “mature dialogues with several health systems”.\n\n“It is still a struggle with reimbursement, in every country,” says Hekla Arnardottir, partner at Crowberry Capital, which has backed Embla, pointing to difficult regulation and healthcare systems that don’t always want to work with startups. Without reimbursement in Europe, she adds, it will be hard for companies to reach the sort of revenue figures needed to raise growth capital and hit unicorn status.\n\nWhether a European startup will be able to do that remains to be seen — but what is clear is that the hype surrounding GLP-1 meds is unlikely to die down anytime soon. “I've never been an investor in a company that’s got so much attention — in a space that’s got so much attention,” says Arnardottir.", 'gpt-4o-mini']
