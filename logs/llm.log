A compassionate female fertility specialist, dressed in a professional white coat, sits across from a couple in their early 30s, who appear engaged yet slightly anxious. The doctor is leaning forward, gesturing with her hands to emphasize a point, while the couple listens intently, their expressions reflecting a mix of hope and concern. A large anatomical model of a human heart is displayed prominently on a nearby table, symbolizing the focus on congenital heart health. The room is bright and inviting, with soft natural light streaming through large windows, creating a warm atmosphere. On the walls, educational posters illustrate the process of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and its potential implications, subtly reinforcing the topic of discussion. The composition captures a medium close-up angle, focusing on the interaction between the doctor and the couple, highlighting the importance of informed patient counseling regarding the risks associated with ART. The overall mood conveys a sense of urgency and care, reflecting the critical nature of understanding the implications of ART on congenital heart health.
