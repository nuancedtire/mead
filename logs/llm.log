CF33-hNIS is a novel oncolytic virotherapy under investigation in the MAST trial (NCT05346484). In this phase 1 study, experts are assessing CF33-hNIS alone and in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors.\n\nThe FDA has granted an orphan drug designation to CF33-hNIS, a novel chimeric oncolytic therapy, in cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nFDA orphan drug status is granted to encourage the development of treatments for rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US. With this designation, Imugene, the sponsor is offered several incentives, including tax credits, potential grant opportunities, exemption from specific administrative fees, and 7 years of market exclusivity following FDA approval.\n\n‚ÄúReceiving orphan drug designation from the FDA is a major milestone for us. It reflects the potential of [CF33-hNIS] to address the urgent need for new treatments for cholangiocarcinoma, a disease with limited therapeutic options. We are excited to continue advancing this program, which has already shown meaningful clinical responses in patients,‚Äù said Leslie Chong, managing director and chief executive officer of Imugene, in a press release.\n\nCF33-hNIS is a genetically engineered oncolytic virus that is encoded with the hNIS transgene. The agent aims to both reduce the replication of the virus in normal cells and produce selective replication in cancer cells, which leads to tumor cell lysis.\n\nThe phase 1 MAST trial is currently evaluating as CF33-hNIS alone and when combined with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors. Enrollment in the study is open to patients aged 18 years and older with a metastatic or advanced solid tumor. Patients are required to have documented radiological progression after treatment with 2 or more prior lines of therapy, which could have included an immune checkpoint inhibitor; at least 1 measurable lesion; an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2; and adequate renal, liver, and hematologic function.\n\nIn the dose escalation portion of the study, patients will receive CF33-hNIS intravenously or intratumorally at 1 of 7 doses, ranging from 8.6 x 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) to 3 x 109 PFU on days 1 and 8 of the first 21-day cycle, then on day 1 of each cycle after. Experts also will assess CF33-hNIS with pembrolizumab where pembrolizumab is being given once every 3 weeks starting on day 1 of cycle 2.\n\nSafety and identifying the recommended phase 2 dose are the primary end points of the study, and secondary end points are overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST criteria and assessing viral replication in tumor lesions via single-photon emission computerized tomography.\n\nPrevious findings from the trial showed that in the monotherapy arm (n = 7), patients had an ORR of 14% and a disease control rate of 86%. An immunological complete response by the fourth cycle of treatment was seen in 1 patient with cholangiocarcinoma. This patient had no known recurrence after 1 year. Additionally, another patient with bile duct cancer had stable disease for more than 5 months.\n\nFor safety, CF33-hNIS given alone was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities reported. No patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse effects (TRAEs). The most commonly reported TRAEs were pyrexia (grade 1, 14.3%; grade 2, 28.6%), fatigue (0%; 14.3%), injection site pain (14.3%; 0%), folliculitis (0%, 14.3%), pneumonia (0%; 14.3%), pustular rash (14.3%; 0%), muscle spasms (0%; 14.3%), myalgia (0%; 14.3%), lymphadenopathy (14.3%; 0%), vomiting (14.3%; 0%), decreased appetite (14.3%; 0%), headache (0%; 14.3%), blister (14.3%; 0%), and erythema (14.3%; 0%). Moreover, there were no grade 3 or higher TRAEs seen.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n1. Imugene receives orphan drug designation for treatment of bile tract cancer. News release. Imugene. September 18, 2024.

It also provides a hair transplant service from two physical clinics in London and Leeds.\n\nOver the past six years, Manual says it has served more than 500k patients.\n\nAlongside its home market of the UK, Manual launched in S√£o Paulo, Brazil in 2021 ‚Äî now a key expansion target for the company.\n\n‚ÄúWe saw an opportunity to improve quality care in a vast market where, outside of the big cities, there is limited healthcare access,‚Äù says Pallis. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve since expanded nationwide.‚Äù\n\n### **The rise of weight loss**\xa0\n\nManual‚Äôs offering has grown considerably since it last raised external funding ‚Äî in a [$30m round in 2021](https://sifted.eu/articles/manual-raises-30m).

The startup behind it, Zoƒ´, promises customers a ‚Äú360-degree check-up‚Äô ‚Äî a three-hour series of tests and exams, ranging from blood tests to eye scans through spirometry and gut microbiome analyses.\n\nThe objective? Collect millions of data points on up to 200 biomarkers that are in turn analysed by an AI model, in order to deliver lifestyle recommendations that, promises Zoƒ´, will prevent disease and improve customers‚Äô long-term wellness.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about adding years of life, but rather life to years,‚Äù says Zoƒ´ cofounder ‚Äî and former special advisor to French president Emmanuel Macron ‚Äî Isma√´l Em√©lien. ‚ÄúThe goal is to learn the body‚Äôs ‚Äòuser manual‚Äô to prevent illnesses and enable people to live in good health for longer.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs not for everyone. Membership to Zoƒ´ is ‚Ç¨3.6k per year, which includes an annual checkup as well as the follow-up recommendations. That‚Äôs roughly the cost of a membership to Soho House, says Zoƒ´'s CFO Antoine Attali ‚Äî and the startup's customers usually belong to the same social circles.\n\nThe clinic caters to premium needs, from snacks elaborated by world-famous chef Alain Ducasse to a balneotherapy section modelled on ‚ÄòJapanese thermal baths‚Äò, featuring a snow cabin (?) and a mineral bath that is, I am told, ‚Äútwice as salty as the Dead Sea‚Äù.\n\nAttali tells me that in the long-term, Zoƒ´ hopes to become accessible to everyone, and that prices will go down to a similar level to your average WiFi subscription.\n\nFor now, though, preventative health remains a hobby of the upper-class. In fact, Zoƒ´'s investors are all private individuals; the company‚Äôs ‚Ç¨20m seed round, which it raised in 2022, included a good number of high-profile billionaires such as Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saad√© and Moderna CEO St√©phane Bancel.\n\nAnd Zoƒ´ is not the only longevity startup appealing to the ultra-rich. Spotify founder Daniel Ek is behind similar ventures, including [Sand Clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/daniel-ek-spotify-sand-clinic-longevity-news), where customers can receive full body check-ups and treatments ranging from vacuum therapy to red light saunas ‚Äî with membership expected to cost between ‚Ç¨1,000 and ‚Ç¨10,000 a month.\n\nEk is also the founder of healthtech Neko Health, which has built a full-body scanner for health data collection that it says helps doctors detect potential diseases earlier. The company [has a clinic in Stockholm](https://sifted.eu/articles/ek-neko-body-scanner-test) and has just opened a new spot in London, right in the middle of Marylebone, where it prices a one-hour scan at ¬£299 ‚Äî almost double the price of a visit to the Stockholm clinic when it opened in 2023 (‚Ç¨180).\n\nDespite the cost, the proposition seems appealing enough. Neko Health says it already has a waiting list of 22k people; Zoƒ´ says it has ‚Äúaround 1k members‚Äù to date and is currently carrying out a dozen check-ups per day ‚Äî but the startup is confident that it can ramp up to reach its maximum capacity of 35k annual check-ups in the next five years.\n\nWhether or not the preventative treatments promised by startups like Zoƒ´, Neko Health and Sand Clinic will ever reach the masses remains to be seen; what seems certain for now is that billionaires won‚Äôt get tired of full-body-scanning anytime soon.\n\n![Image 1: A photo of the entrance to Zo√Ø's centre in Paris](https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/06145636/Zoi%CC%84_WIP6_%C2%A911h45-HD-4.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThe entrance to Zo√Ø's centre in Paris.

It allows clinicians to monitor patients at home, by providing them with devices to measure health factors like blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nDoccla has become the largest virtual ward provider for the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS). In December 2023, it signed its first contract with a German hospital and, in June, it partnered with Ireland‚Äôs Health Service Executive (HSE).\n\nDoccla‚Äôs founder and chair Martin Ratz tells Sifted that the company has its sights set on France, partly due to a change in the healthcare system that makes it easier to receive compensation for remote monitoring of patients.\n\n‚ÄúWith the new compensation system in France (similar to that in the US), there are specific codes for remote monitoring which will facilitate the financials tremendously, and for us, it‚Äôs a huge opportunity to scale,‚Äù says Ratz.\n\nThe virtual A&E\n\nSweden-founded Doccla entered the UK with a pilot project for a virtual ward in 2020, and the timing of the pandemic meant that the company was off to a flying start. It has since then grown its customer base to 10 countries in Europe. Monitoring patients at home, instead of in an overcrowded emergency department at a hospital, has not only meant that hospitals can better manage the patients they have in-house, but also cut costs.\n\nAccording to a recent study funded by the NHS, by implementing Doccla, regional NHS departments have experienced a 63% reduction in A&E attendance while enjoying a 300% return on investment.\n\nPatients signed over to Doccla from hospitals are monitored around the clock using hardware, software and virtual care, which allow medical staff to access patient data in real-time and pre-emptively flag concerns, triggering in-person appointments before issues escalate.\n\nSo far Doccla has monitored over 4m patient days with over 95% patient compliance. Today the company says it‚Äôs adding 1k new patients every month.\n\n‚ÄúOver time, we want to onboard 100k new patients on a monthly basis,‚Äù Ratz says.\n\nPartnering with pharma\n\nDoccla has also recently started conversations with large pharmaceutical companies to deliver clinical data for use in clinical trials. According to Ratz, what pharma companies often struggle with is recruiting patients, as well as compliance (patients taking their drugs when they should).\n\n‚ÄúWe have a compliance rate of 92-97% for our patients, those are sky-high numbers,‚Äù Ratz says. ‚ÄúThis is because we are in very close contact with our patients.‚Äù\n\nDoccla says it‚Äôs interested in pharma partnerships for two main reasons. The first is that providing clinical data is very close to what Doccla already provides to public health providers. The second is that Ratz says he‚Äôs seen software companies, like UK-based Huma and US-based Biofourmis, run such partnerships this successfully.\n\nWith 180 employees, with around 40 of them clinicians, the company now wants to grow its data science team, which today only consists of a few people. By using the data it collects from patients, and combining it with conversations between patients and the care team, Ratz believes Doccla can improve on the service the patients receive and become more preventative in its care.\n\nIn one region in the UK, Doccla has taken over 500 patients who have been in and out of hospital for a long time, to monitor them in a more preventative way.\n\n‚ÄúWe can in a proactive way decrease the number of hospital visits ‚Äî in this case, we decreased them by 63% which is a huge saving for society,‚Äù Ratz says.\n\nDoccla has raised a total of ¬£52m to date.\n\nIn October of last year, Ratz was the largest shareholder with 35% of the shares, followed by General Catalyst at 26%, Dag Larsson (CEO and cofounder) at 15%, Giant Ventures at 9% and Speedinvest at 11%, according to UK Companies House.", 'gpt-4o-mini']

A recent study sheds light on this innovative strategy.\n\nIn a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial involving 739 hospitalized smokers, researchers found:\n\n- Higher desire to quit smoking correlates with increased abstinence rates.\n- In the opt-out group, abstinence rates were 32% for those expressing a strong desire (level 10) to quit.\n- Even among those with the lowest desire (level 0), the opt-out group still achieved an 8% abstinence rate.\n- The treatment included nicotine replacement therapy, post-discharge medications, and counseling support.\n\nThese findings suggest that opt-out treatment can be effective, even for those less motivated to quit. This could reshape how we approach smoking cessation in clinical settings. \n\nHow might you implement opt-out strategies in your practice to support patients in their quit journey?', ['Healthcare & Policy', 'SmokingCessation', 'PublicHealth', 'ClinicalResearch'], 'https://fal.media/files/rabbit/Ft1DQUGWo-NHf1vopnIIB.png', 'http://medscape.com/viewarticle/opt-out-only-treatment-can-help-reluctant-smokers-quit-2024a1000h0i', 'You are a content strategist specializing in crafting engaging and informative social media posts for healthcare professionals based on detailed medical articles or web content.

Participants were randomly assigned to either a group that received quitting smoking materials that they would not receive if they actively opted out or an opt-in group, in which people only received materials if they selected help.\n*   Treatment included nicotine replacement therapy, prescriptions for post-discharge medications, a 2-week medication starter kit, treatment planning, and four outpatient counseling calls.\n*   Participants were instructed to indicate their initial readiness to quit smoking on a scale of 0-10, with 0 representing no thoughts about quitting and 10 representing active efforts to quit.\n*   The association of the desire to quit smoking and its interaction with the treatment group at 1-month follow-up was assessed.\n\n**TAKEAWAY:**\n-------------\n\n*   A higher desire to quit smoking was associated with higher smoking abstinence rates in the overall population.\n*   The abstinence rate for smoking was 32% (95% CI, 25%-40%) in participants with level 10 desire to quit smoking in the opt-out group.\n*   In participants with level 0 desire to quit smoking, the smoking abstinence rate was at 8% (95% CI, 3%-16%) in the opt-out group.\n\n**IN PRACTICE:**\n----------------\n\n"These findings may inform clinical decision-making.

The service received 1.82 million referrals in 2023/24. This is slightly higher than 2021/2022, and more than double the 884,000 received in 2012/13.\n\nAs more people come forward for help, the NHS is looking to use NICE-recommended digital therapies to help increase the support available.\n\n**Figure 1: Record number of referrals to NHS Talking Therapies**\n\n**Referrals received, by financial year.**\n\nNHS Talking Therapies offer NICE-recommended psychological therapies for adults with common mental health conditions such as depression, stress, social anxiety, phobias or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some programmes extend their support to young people aged 16 and 17.\n\n‚ÄúCOVID had a big impact,‚Äù said Sarah Watts, Clinical Lead for Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent NHS Talking Therapies. ‚ÄúThe good thing is that more people are coming forward. People are recognising that they need therapy and support, and they are asking for it.‚Äù\n\nWe recommend 7 digitally enabled therapies to treat depression and anxiety disorders in adults. The technologies can be used in NHS Talking Therapies while more evidence is generated on their clinical and cost-effectiveness.\n\nOur rapid assessments compared the digital technologies to traditional face-to-face therapy. According to these figures, digitally enabled therapies for anxiety disorders could potentially save around 6,000 therapist hours per 1,000 people in NHS Talking Therapies in England. For depression technologies, approximately 6,800 therapist hours could be saved.\n\nEvidence from current practice provided by NHS England and analysed by us indicates that digital therapies recommended for PTSD could save over 5,000 hours of therapist time per 1,000 people. Almost 2,500 therapist hours per 1,000 people could be saved for social anxiety disorders, and 600 for depression.\n\n**Figure 2: Estimated therapist time that could be saved by NICE-recommended digital therapies for social anxiety, PTSD, and depression**\n\nThe actual number of hours saved will depend on the proportion of patients who opt to use digital therapies.\n\nThese technologies can be accessed online or through apps and include materials based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). They must be used with support from a trained practitioner or therapist, who monitors progress, risks, and outcomes. Some of these therapies are already in use in the NHS.\n\nMs Rebecca Morley, specialist committee member and team manager at NHS North Yorkshire Talking Therapies said: ‚ÄúWe consider digital inequalities in terms of accessibility. Clinicians can offer technological support to help patients either enter digitally enabled therapies or maintain them, depending on their needs.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA digital therapy is an additional tool in the toolbox that will be appropriate for some people,‚Äù said Ms Watts. ‚ÄúPatient choice is absolutely key.‚Äù\n\n> Improving access to mental health care is a top priority for the NHS. The pandemic led to rising pressures, with more people than ever before now in contact with mental health services. NICE-recommended digital therapies can increase the support available to people where appropriate, alongside therapists, and help NHS staff to provide care in a flexible and timely manner.\n\nThe future of digital mental health\n\nNICE also recommends 4 digital technologies that can help children and young people with feelings of anxiety or low mood, and another 4 technologies for people with psychosis: 3 digital therapies to help manage symptoms or prevent relapse in adults, and a virtual reality (VR) technology to treat severe agoraphobia in those over 16. They are Early Value Assessments and can be used while more data is being collected on their clinical and cost-effectiveness.\n\n‚ÄúDigital mental health over the next decade will embrace new technologies including artificial intelligence, wearables, and extended reality,‚Äù said Professor Chris Hollis, specialist committee member and Chair of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Digital Mental Health at the University of Nottingham. ‚ÄúThere will be a greater shift to prevention and early intervention.‚Äù\n\nDr Maria Loades, specialist committee member and Clinical Psychologist at the University of Bath noted: ‚ÄúWe need to be open-minded to these innovations. We need to ensure that choice and flexibility remain in the system, and that human support is available where it is needed and in a timely manner.‚Äù\n\n> Mental health services are facing record demand, and these digitally enabled therapies can help the NHS get support to more people faster.\n> \n> Our rapid assessments show they have promise and the additional evidence collected during this period will help us make sure that they are clinically effective and represent good value for money for the taxpayer. This guidance underscores NICE‚Äôs commitment to focusing on what matters most to people and the health and care system.\n\nNotes:\n\n*   There was not sufficient data available to calculate savings for generalised anxiety or body dysmorphic disorder.\n    \n*   All technologies will need Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC) approval before they can be adopted by the NHS. They will also require an NHS Talking Therapies Digitally Enabled Therapy assessment from NHS England, and CE or UKCA mark approval.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

This gene produces a protein that controls cell growth, and a mutation in this gene can cause cells to grow abnormally. This can lead to cysts or tumours developing in different parts of the body, such as the kidneys, brain and pancreas that can impair function or become cancerous.\n\nEvidence shows belzutifan can reduce tumour size or prevent them from getting bigger and prevent the loss of organ function that people experience from repeated tumours and surgeries.\n\nVHL varies from person to person and although some people might only develop 1 or a few tumours in their whole life, others might have multiple tumours in different (or the same) organs. There are only about 600 adults in England living with the condition.\n\nNICE is looking at belzutifan for adults who need treatment for VHL-associated kidney, central nervous system or pancreatic tumours.\n\nThis condition severely affects the quality of life of people who are living with it, as well as their families and carers.\n\nThere are no medicines that are currently recommended by NICE that address the underlying causes of this condition and surgery is the main treatment option for removing tumours and cysts.\n\nThis is a new treatment that has the potential to prevent loss of organ function from repeated tumours and surgeries and improve people‚Äôs quality of life at a price that is good value for the taxpayer. We‚Äôre therefore pleased to be able to recommend it today while more evidence is collected.\n\nThe committee heard from patient experts who explained that for some people there are a wide variety of debilitating symptoms depending on where the tumours are growing in the body. These include constant pain, loss of balance and motor skills, loss of vision, breathlessness, coughing, headaches, confusion, severe nausea and fatigue.\n\nEvidence from a small study suggests that belzutifan reduces tumour size and gives people longer before their condition gets worse. However there are some uncertainties and more evidence is needed before it can be considered for routine use on the NHS, so it is recommended for use with further data collection; known as managed access.\n\nManaged access gives people faster access to promising new treatments that might not be recommended because of uncertainties about their clinical or cost effectiveness. During managed access, more evidence is collected to address any uncertainties about a treatment and NICE then uses this evidence to assess whether the treatment should be made available for routine use on the NHS.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

The guideline reminds people with adrenal insufficiency to increase tablet glucocorticoid doses if they are unwell, and to call 999 or attend an emergency department if they become unwell and think they are developing an adrenal crisis.\n\nIn 2022-23 there were 1,220 hospital admissions for adrenal crisis. An adrenal crisis occurs when the levels of cortisol in a person‚Äôs body fall significantly. It is a medical emergency and if left untreated it can be fatal.\n\n> This useful and useable guideline will help to ensure high quality care is offered to people with this condition and support them, their families and carers to make informed decisions about their treatment and long-term care.\n> \n> Most people with adrenal insufficiency live active lives with few limitations. Our guideline will help them manage the condition effectively and keep themselves safe\n\nChloe Mezzetti, who lives with Addison‚Äôs disease and was a lay member of NICE‚Äôs guideline committee, said: ‚ÄúThese valuable guidelines will help shape the standard of care and improve patient safety for people living with Addison\'s and adrenal insufficiency. I have truly enjoyed my role as a lay member and contributing to these guidelines by sharing my lived experience."\n\n> After diagnosis, an emergency hydrocortisone injection kit should always be prescribed and explained to new patients to prevent a potentially fatal adrenal crisis. Due to being a rare condition, this has not always been the case for our community. It is fantastic these affordable and widely available emergency injection kits are one of the new recommendations in the NICE guidelines ‚Äì saving lives. I always carry my injection kit in my bag, and I also have a backup kit which I keep in my car.\n\nThe guideline aims to help healthcare professionals spot symptoms earlier and manage the condition effectively.\n\nThe guideline recommends that healthcare professionals:\n\n*   Consider adrenal insufficiency in people with an unexplained increase in darkened patches of skin (hyperpigmentation) or when there is no other clinical explanation for the presence of persistent symptoms such as weight loss, nausea or vomiting and lack of appetite.\n    \n*   Offer a serum cortisol test between 8am and 9am to people aged one year and over with suspected adrenal insufficiency to help diagnose the condition. The test needs to be administered at this time because this is when cortisol levels peak and the results are most accurate.\n    \n\nTreatment for adrenal insufficiency usually involves corticosteroid (steroid) replacement therapy for life and the guideline stresses the importance of glucocorticoid as an essential hormone replacement and lifesaving treatment for adrenal crisis.\n\nAdrenal insufficiency can be a life-threatening condition, as it leaves people unable to produce higher levels of cortisol when they face illness, are having an operation or during childbirth. Without this increase in cortisol, the body can go into an adrenal crisis, leading to low blood pressure, coma and, if untreated, death.\n\nIt is estimated that between 5,700 and 7,900 people in England have primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison‚Äôs Disease) and between 8,500 and 15,800 people have the more common secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n\n[Read the full clinical guideline on adrenal insufficiency: identification and management](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-ng10237).', 'gpt-4o-mini']

It has been shown to be effective in reducing the bleeding caused by uterine fibroids, and also shrinking the fibroids themselves, compared with a dummy treatment. It works by reducing the release of hormones which control oestrogen and progesterone production by the ovaries.\n\nLinzagolix is recommended for use as a longer-term treatment (more than 6 months) and is not for people who need short-term treatment, for example, before planned uterine fibroid surgery. It can also be taken with or without hormonal add-back therapy (ABT). ABT involves taking a low dose of hormones at the same time as a GnRH antagonist to give the body enough hormones to protect bones and control any possible side effects.\n\n> I am pleased we have been able to recommend a further treatment option for managing moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids.\n> \n> Uterine fibroids can have many debilitating symptoms including pain and heavy menstrual bleeding. If left untreated they can lead to infertility and have a substantial effect on quality of life.\n> \n> Linzagolix offers greater flexibility as it can be taken either with or without hormone therapy and means clinicians can provide more personalised care in the treatment of this often debilitating condition.\n\nUterine fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in or around the uterus (womb). Their exact cause is not known but they have been linked to oestrogen and progesterone. Around 66% of women develop at least 1 uterine fibroid during their lifetime and 33% of women will develop symptoms from uterine fibroids.\n\nMost fibroids are small and do not cause symptoms. However, some people with fibroids develop symptoms that can include very heavy or long menstrual periods or pelvic pressure or pain. People with moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids can experience a substantial negative effect on their quality of life.\n\nUsual treatment for moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids includes hormonal treatments, such as GnRH receptor agonists and antagonists, and supportive care.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

Teclistamab and elranatamab are immunotherapies that work by redirecting T-cells to multiple myeloma cells and helping to destroy them. Both are given by injection under the skin.\n\nThe recommendations are ‚Äòoptimised‚Äô which means the treatments were approved with some modifications to the population the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency licence covers.\n\nThe draft guidance for elranatamab replaces the final draft guidance published on 21 June 2024 which was withdrawn to allow consultation on the optimised recommendation.\n\n**Why ‚Äòoptimised‚Äô?**\n\nElranatamab and teclistamab sit in a similar place in the treatment pathway to each other and have the same indication wording in their marketing authorisations (MA):\n\n‚Äòa monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least 3 prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy‚Äô.\n\nBecause both companies (Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, respectively) only compared their treatments with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone, our draft recommendation for both treatments is that they should be limited to the population that would be eligible for pomalidomide plus dexamethasone at this stage in the pathway.\n\nPeople who have already been treated with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone earlier in their treatment pathway would not therefore be eligible under these draft recommendations.\n\n**Not recommended**\n\nWe were not able to make a positive recommendation for isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (IsaPD) for people with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have already been treated with lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.\n\nOur independent committee found that the cost of the drug in relation to the size of the benefits is considerably higher than what is considered an acceptable use of NHS resources.\n\nThis decision follows a review of TA 658 which recommended IsaPD for entry into the Cancer Drugs Fund - a funding arrangement that allowed its use in the NHS while more evidence about its potential clinical and cost effectiveness was collected.\n\nWe have received 2 appeals against this final draft guidance which will be heard on 23 September.\n\nPeople will still be able to start IsaPD treatment until final guidance is published after the resolution of the appeal. When final guidance is published, whatever the recommendation, people already on this treatment will be able to continue it until they and their NHS healthcare professional consider it appropriate to stop.\n\nAlternative treatment options for people eligible for isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone are daratumumab monotherapy or pomalidomide and dexamethasone.\n\nIsaPD sits in a similar place in the treatment pathway, but different previous treatments means that different people may be eligible for isatuximab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone than are eligible for elranatamab and teclistimab.\n\nFunding\n\nAs there is a positive draft recommendation for managed access in the relevant population, interim funding is available for anyone eligible for elranatamab under this recommendation.\n\nAgain, because there is a draft recommendation for routine commissioning in place, interim funding is available for people eligible for teclistimab.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

The service received 1.82 million referrals in 2023/24. This is slightly higher than 2021/2022, and more than double the 884,000 received in 2012/13.\n\nAs more people come forward for help, the NHS is looking to use NICE-recommended digital therapies to help increase the support available.\n\n**Figure 1: Record number of referrals to NHS Talking Therapies**\n\n**Referrals received, by financial year.**\n\nNHS Talking Therapies offer NICE-recommended psychological therapies for adults with common mental health conditions such as depression, stress, social anxiety, phobias or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some programmes extend their support to young people aged 16 and 17.\n\n‚ÄúCOVID had a big impact,‚Äù said Sarah Watts, Clinical Lead for Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent NHS Talking Therapies. ‚ÄúThe good thing is that more people are coming forward. People are recognising that they need therapy and support, and they are asking for it.‚Äù\n\nWe recommend 7 digitally enabled therapies to treat depression and anxiety disorders in adults. The technologies can be used in NHS Talking Therapies while more evidence is generated on their clinical and cost-effectiveness.\n\nOur rapid assessments compared the digital technologies to traditional face-to-face therapy. According to these figures, digitally enabled therapies for anxiety disorders could potentially save around 6,000 therapist hours per 1,000 people in NHS Talking Therapies in England. For depression technologies, approximately 6,800 therapist hours could be saved.\n\nEvidence from current practice provided by NHS England and analysed by us indicates that digital therapies recommended for PTSD could save over 5,000 hours of therapist time per 1,000 people. Almost 2,500 therapist hours per 1,000 people could be saved for social anxiety disorders, and 600 for depression.\n\n**Figure 2: Estimated therapist time that could be saved by NICE-recommended digital therapies for social anxiety, PTSD, and depression**\n\nThe actual number of hours saved will depend on the proportion of patients who opt to use digital therapies.\n\nThese technologies can be accessed online or through apps and include materials based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). They must be used with support from a trained practitioner or therapist, who monitors progress, risks, and outcomes. Some of these therapies are already in use in the NHS.\n\nMs Rebecca Morley, specialist committee member and team manager at NHS North Yorkshire Talking Therapies said: ‚ÄúWe consider digital inequalities in terms of accessibility. Clinicians can offer technological support to help patients either enter digitally enabled therapies or maintain them, depending on their needs.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA digital therapy is an additional tool in the toolbox that will be appropriate for some people,‚Äù said Ms Watts. ‚ÄúPatient choice is absolutely key.‚Äù\n\n> Improving access to mental health care is a top priority for the NHS. The pandemic led to rising pressures, with more people than ever before now in contact with mental health services. NICE-recommended digital therapies can increase the support available to people where appropriate, alongside therapists, and help NHS staff to provide care in a flexible and timely manner.\n\nThe future of digital mental health\n\nNICE also recommends 4 digital technologies that can help children and young people with feelings of anxiety or low mood, and another 4 technologies for people with psychosis: 3 digital therapies to help manage symptoms or prevent relapse in adults, and a virtual reality (VR) technology to treat severe agoraphobia in those over 16. They are Early Value Assessments and can be used while more data is being collected on their clinical and cost-effectiveness.\n\n‚ÄúDigital mental health over the next decade will embrace new technologies including artificial intelligence, wearables, and extended reality,‚Äù said Professor Chris Hollis, specialist committee member and Chair of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Digital Mental Health at the University of Nottingham. ‚ÄúThere will be a greater shift to prevention and early intervention.‚Äù\n\nDr Maria Loades, specialist committee member and Clinical Psychologist at the University of Bath noted: ‚ÄúWe need to be open-minded to these innovations. We need to ensure that choice and flexibility remain in the system, and that human support is available where it is needed and in a timely manner.‚Äù\n\n> Mental health services are facing record demand, and these digitally enabled therapies can help the NHS get support to more people faster.\n> \n> Our rapid assessments show they have promise and the additional evidence collected during this period will help us make sure that they are clinically effective and represent good value for money for the taxpayer. This guidance underscores NICE‚Äôs commitment to focusing on what matters most to people and the health and care system.\n\nNotes:\n\n*   There was not sufficient data available to calculate savings for generalised anxiety or body dysmorphic disorder.\n    \n*   All technologies will need Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC) approval before they can be adopted by the NHS. They will also require an NHS Talking Therapies Digitally Enabled Therapy assessment from NHS England, and CE or UKCA mark approval.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

This gene produces a protein that controls cell growth, and a mutation in this gene can cause cells to grow abnormally. This can lead to cysts or tumours developing in different parts of the body, such as the kidneys, brain and pancreas that can impair function or become cancerous.\n\nEvidence shows belzutifan can reduce tumour size or prevent them from getting bigger and prevent the loss of organ function that people experience from repeated tumours and surgeries.\n\nVHL varies from person to person and although some people might only develop 1 or a few tumours in their whole life, others might have multiple tumours in different (or the same) organs. There are only about 600 adults in England living with the condition.\n\nNICE is looking at belzutifan for adults who need treatment for VHL-associated kidney, central nervous system or pancreatic tumours.\n\nThis condition severely affects the quality of life of people who are living with it, as well as their families and carers.\n\nThere are no medicines that are currently recommended by NICE that address the underlying causes of this condition and surgery is the main treatment option for removing tumours and cysts.\n\nThis is a new treatment that has the potential to prevent loss of organ function from repeated tumours and surgeries and improve people‚Äôs quality of life at a price that is good value for the taxpayer. We‚Äôre therefore pleased to be able to recommend it today while more evidence is collected.\n\nThe committee heard from patient experts who explained that for some people there are a wide variety of debilitating symptoms depending on where the tumours are growing in the body. These include constant pain, loss of balance and motor skills, loss of vision, breathlessness, coughing, headaches, confusion, severe nausea and fatigue.\n\nEvidence from a small study suggests that belzutifan reduces tumour size and gives people longer before their condition gets worse. However there are some uncertainties and more evidence is needed before it can be considered for routine use on the NHS, so it is recommended for use with further data collection; known as managed access.\n\nManaged access gives people faster access to promising new treatments that might not be recommended because of uncertainties about their clinical or cost effectiveness. During managed access, more evidence is collected to address any uncertainties about a treatment and NICE then uses this evidence to assess whether the treatment should be made available for routine use on the NHS.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

The guideline reminds people with adrenal insufficiency to increase tablet glucocorticoid doses if they are unwell, and to call 999 or attend an emergency department if they become unwell and think they are developing an adrenal crisis.\n\nIn 2022-23 there were 1,220 hospital admissions for adrenal crisis. An adrenal crisis occurs when the levels of cortisol in a person‚Äôs body fall significantly. It is a medical emergency and if left untreated it can be fatal.\n\n> This useful and useable guideline will help to ensure high quality care is offered to people with this condition and support them, their families and carers to make informed decisions about their treatment and long-term care.\n> \n> Most people with adrenal insufficiency live active lives with few limitations. Our guideline will help them manage the condition effectively and keep themselves safe\n\nChloe Mezzetti, who lives with Addison‚Äôs disease and was a lay member of NICE‚Äôs guideline committee, said: ‚ÄúThese valuable guidelines will help shape the standard of care and improve patient safety for people living with Addison\'s and adrenal insufficiency. I have truly enjoyed my role as a lay member and contributing to these guidelines by sharing my lived experience."\n\n> After diagnosis, an emergency hydrocortisone injection kit should always be prescribed and explained to new patients to prevent a potentially fatal adrenal crisis. Due to being a rare condition, this has not always been the case for our community. It is fantastic these affordable and widely available emergency injection kits are one of the new recommendations in the NICE guidelines ‚Äì saving lives. I always carry my injection kit in my bag, and I also have a backup kit which I keep in my car.\n\nThe guideline aims to help healthcare professionals spot symptoms earlier and manage the condition effectively.\n\nThe guideline recommends that healthcare professionals:\n\n*   Consider adrenal insufficiency in people with an unexplained increase in darkened patches of skin (hyperpigmentation) or when there is no other clinical explanation for the presence of persistent symptoms such as weight loss, nausea or vomiting and lack of appetite.\n    \n*   Offer a serum cortisol test between 8am and 9am to people aged one year and over with suspected adrenal insufficiency to help diagnose the condition. The test needs to be administered at this time because this is when cortisol levels peak and the results are most accurate.\n    \n\nTreatment for adrenal insufficiency usually involves corticosteroid (steroid) replacement therapy for life and the guideline stresses the importance of glucocorticoid as an essential hormone replacement and lifesaving treatment for adrenal crisis.\n\nAdrenal insufficiency can be a life-threatening condition, as it leaves people unable to produce higher levels of cortisol when they face illness, are having an operation or during childbirth. Without this increase in cortisol, the body can go into an adrenal crisis, leading to low blood pressure, coma and, if untreated, death.\n\nIt is estimated that between 5,700 and 7,900 people in England have primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison‚Äôs Disease) and between 8,500 and 15,800 people have the more common secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n\n[Read the full clinical guideline on adrenal insufficiency: identification and management](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-ng10237).', 'gpt-4o-mini']

It has been shown to be effective in reducing the bleeding caused by uterine fibroids, and also shrinking the fibroids themselves, compared with a dummy treatment. It works by reducing the release of hormones which control oestrogen and progesterone production by the ovaries.\n\nLinzagolix is recommended for use as a longer-term treatment (more than 6 months) and is not for people who need short-term treatment, for example, before planned uterine fibroid surgery. It can also be taken with or without hormonal add-back therapy (ABT).

Their exact cause is not known but they have been linked to oestrogen and progesterone. Around 66% of women develop at least 1 uterine fibroid during their lifetime and 33% of women will develop symptoms from uterine fibroids.\n\nMost fibroids are small and do not cause symptoms. However, some people with fibroids develop symptoms that can include very heavy or long menstrual periods or pelvic pressure or pain.

When final guidance is published, whatever the recommendation, people already on this treatment will be able to continue it until they and their NHS healthcare professional consider it appropriate to stop.\n\nAlternative treatment options for people eligible for isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone are daratumumab monotherapy or pomalidomide and dexamethasone.\n\nIsaPD sits in a similar place in the treatment pathway, but different previous treatments means that different people may be eligible for isatuximab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone than are eligible for elranatamab and teclistimab.\n\nFunding\n\nAs there is a positive draft recommendation for managed access in the relevant population, interim funding is available for anyone eligible for elranatamab under this recommendation.\n\nAgain, because there is a draft recommendation for routine commissioning in place, interim funding is available for people eligible for teclistimab.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

Mutations in several mitochondrial proteins that regulate the dynamics and turnover of this organelle lead to specific neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, mutations in parkin or PINK1 cause early-onset Parkinson‚Äôs disease (EOPD), a movement disorder arising from the loss of specific neurons including (but not exclusively) dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain that are responsible for fine motor control. Parkin and PINK1 work together to mediate selective turnover of damaged mitochondria via macroautophagy (a process called mitophagy) or through formation of mitochondria-derived vesicles that deliver damaged cargo to lysosomes for degradation. Defects in these pathways lead to mitochondria-linked inflammation and autoimmune responses that lead to neuronal death. Furthermore, loss of soluble parkin in the human brain correlates with age and impaired mitophagy is associated with sporadic PD. While the details of the pathways leading to cell loss remain to be elucidated, it is clear that parkin and PINK1 suppress these deleterious responses by targeting mitochondrial compartments for degradation.\n\nThe molecular mechanisms of parkin/PINK1 have been elucidated in detail over the last two decades. Parkin is a member of the RING-In-Between-RING (RBR) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which carry a RING1 domain that binds E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, as well as a catalytic Rcat (or RING2) domain that transfers ubiquitin to a substrate via a thioester intermediate. Parkin also has two zinc-finger domains called RING0 and IBR, as well as an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain with a regulatory phosphorylation site. In the basal state, parkin adopts a conformation with three features that maintain auto-inhibition: (1) the Rcat domain binds to RING0, which blocks access to the active site Cys431 in Rcat, (2) the Repressor Element of Parkin (REP), located upstream of Rcat, binds to RING1 and occludes the E2-binding site, (3) the Ubl binds to RING1, which prevents Ubl phosphorylation by PINK1 at Ser65. Upon mitochondrial damage, PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), where its cytosolic kinase domain phosphorylates Ser65 in ubiquitin. Phospho-ubiquitin (pUb) recruits parkin to the OMM through a high-affinity site on the RING1 domain, which induces the release and phosphorylation of the Ubl domain. In turn, the phosphorylated Ubl domain (pUbl) binds to RING0 and displaces the Rcat domain and REP, allowing the formation of the active thioester transfer complex with a charged E2~Ub conjugate. This complex is further stabilized by the activation element (ACT) of parkin, located in the Ubl-RING0 linker, which makes contacts with both the pUbl and RING0 domains. Active parkin then ubiquitinates OMM proteins such as Mfn2 and Miro, which leads to selective mitochondrial turnover.\n\nPathogenic missense EOPD mutations can be found throughout parkin domains. Those have been categorized into 5 functional groups based on their normalized abundance and impact on mitophagy. Groups 1 and 2 are clearly or likely pathogenic and have the greatest impact on mitophagy. Group 1 mutants affect protein folding and stability and include mutations in zinc-coordinating cysteines, as well as R275W in the RING1 domain. Group 2 mutants reduce mitophagy without affecting protein stability. Those include mutations in the active site (e.g., C431F), as well as mutations that prevent pUb or pUbl binding (e.g., K211N). Mutations that affect the PINK1-mediated activation such as Ubl mutations R42P and V56E, or K211N in RING0 which impairs pUbl-binding, could all be rescued by synthetic activating mutations that disrupt auto-inhibitory interactions. Those activating mutations include F146A in RING0 (Rcat and ACT interface), and W403A in the REP (RING1 interface), which can also rescue the parkin S65A mutation or Ubl deletion. In a recent survey of synthetic activation mutants, we found that mutations that robustly increase parkin‚Äôs activity and can rescue the S65A mutation form a cluster at the junction of the REP-RING1 and RING0-Rcat interfaces, suggesting this is a hotspot for parkin activation.\n\nActivation of the parkin/PINK1 pathway is an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of EOPD as well as sporadic PD. Building on the discovery of kinetin as a PINK1 activator, Mitokinin (acquired by Abbvie in 2023) developed potent small-molecules that stimulate PINK1-dependent mitophagy in the presence of mitochondrial damage (EC50\u2009~\u2009500\u2009nM) and promote the clearance of Œ±-synuclein aggregates, which are a hallmark of sporadic PD. Inhibitors of USP30, a deubiquitinating enzyme on the OMM that counters parkin‚Äôs activity, are also being developed by several companies and are currently under clinical evaluation. Other groups used phenotypic screens or computational approaches to identify small molecules that stimulate parkin/PINK1-mediated mitophagy, but the targets of these molecules remain unknown. Parkin-activating compounds have also been pursued by several groups, with three patents reporting small-molecules that activate parkin-mediated mitophagy. However, it is unclear how these compounds increase parkin activity, and whether they mediate their effect through parkin directly. In 2022, our group at Biogen reported a class of small-molecule allosteric modulators that increase parkin‚Äôs E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in biochemical assays. These tetrahydropyrazolo-pyrazine (THPP) compounds activate parkin in a pUb-dependent manner, demonstrate stereospecificity, and have submicromolar EC50 values. However, in the absence of structural data, the mechanism of action of these compounds remained unknown.\n\nHere, we report the structural basis for the activation of parkin by THPP compounds. Using autoubiquitination assays and isothermal calorimetry (ITC), we show that binding of the most potent THPP compound BIO-2007817 (EC50\u2009=\u2009150\u2009nM) is dependent on the binding of pUb or exogenous pUbl to RING0. Indeed, we recently discovered that pUb can directly activate parkin through binding the RING0 domain. We built on this to determine the crystal structure of a related THPP compound BIO-1975900 bound to the complex of parkin RING0-RING1-IBR domains (R0RB) and two pUb molecules. The structure, confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mutagenesis, reveals that the THPP compounds bind to the RING0 domain and make contacts with the pUb molecule in the RING0 site (pUbl binding site), mimicking the ACT element. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of two subseries of THPP compounds establishes the importance of binding pockets in RING0 (near W183 and P180) and pUb (near K48). Based on this structural model, we hypothesized that the THPP compounds would rescue Ubl mutations. Indeed, we demonstrate that BIO-2007817 can partially rescue EOPD mutations R42P, V56E, as well S65A and ŒîUbl using in organello ubiquitination assays and mitoKeima-based cellular mitophagy assays. These results show that RBR ligases can be modulated pharmacologically and highlight the clinical potential of THPP compounds in the treatment of EOPD.\n\nResults\n\nUbl is not essential for parkin activation by BIO-2007817\n\nPrevious experiments showed that BIO-2007817 could trigger autoubiquitination activity of unphosphorylated parkin in the presence of pUb. We confirmed those results with both human and rat parkin, which share 86% identity. At 200\u2009¬µM, BIO-2007817 induced activity similar to phosphorylated (activated) parkin but the compound did not further stimulate the activity of phosphorylated parkin. As previously reported, the activation was strictly dependent on the presence of pUb. To avoid charging of the E2 enzyme with pUb, a C-terminal deletion (pUbŒîG76) was used. Activation could also be detected in ubiquitin-vinyl sulfone (Ub-VS) assays that measure the accessibility of Rcat and are not dependent on the upstream components of the ubiquitination cascade. We next asked if the parkin Ubl domain was required for activation. We observed equal autoubiquitination activity of full-length and R0RBR parkin (lacking the Ubl domain) in both the human and rat proteins. Thus, the Ubl domain is not implicated in the mechanism of activation.\n\nBIO-2007817 requires pUb bound to RING0 domain\n\nPhospho-ubiquitin can bind two distinct sites in parkin. The high-affinity site on RING1 mediates the recruitment of parkin to the mitochondria. With an affinity of around 20\u2009nM, it is formed by residues H302 and R305 and promotes detachment and phosphorylation of the Ubl domain. The second site is located on the RING0 domain and regulates parkin activity. While the second site typically binds pUbl (when parkin is phosphorylated), we previously demonstrated that it can also bind pUb. The site is formed by residues K211, R163 and K161 and with an affinity of around 400\u2009nM for pUb and 1\u2009¬µM for pUbl. This binding forces the dissociation of Rcat domain and the release of parkin ligase activity.\n\nWe investigated which of the two sites is needed to promote activation by comparing the effects of a RING1 double mutation (H302A A320R) and a RING0 mutation (K211N). In the absence of compound, none of the parkin variants‚Äîwild-type, H302A A320R, or K211N‚Äîcan autoubiquitinate in the presence of pUb. Upon addition of BIO-2007817, the double mutant H302A A320R was activated to close to wild-type levels as judged by the disappearance of unmodified parkin and appearance of a high molecular weight smear of autoubiquitinated parkin. In contrast, the K211N parkin mutant was strongly impaired with an absence of high molecular weight parkin adducts. Thus, pUb binding to RING0 but not RING1 is required for activation by BIO-2007817. We confirmed this result in the Ub-VS assay that measures Rcat release. At 2.5\u2009¬µM BIO-2007817, half of wild-type parkin was modified by the Ub-VS reagent while the K211N mutation completely prevented parkin modification even at 200\u2009¬µM. Taken together, these results demonstrate that activation by BIO-2007817 requires the binding of an exogenous pUb molecule to the RING0 binding site of parkin.\n\nBIO-2007817 acts a molecular glue for RING0 and pUb/pUbl\n\nWe measured the affinity of BIO-2007817 for parkin using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments with a parkin construct R0RB that lacks both the Ubl domain and the Rcat domain. Since pUb and Rcat compete for binding to RING0, deleting the Rcat domain favors pUb binding. The initial experiment measured BIO-2007817 binding to R0RB with pUb bound to both the RING1 and RING0 sites (R0RB + two pUb). BIO-2007817 bound the complex with 10\u2009nM affinity and one-to-one stoichiometry. The interaction was highly specific as the inactive diastereomer BIO-2007818 bound with 150-fold less affinity.\n\nIsothermal titration calorimetry measurements with different parkin complexes and titrants. BIO-2007817 binds to the R0RB:2√ópUb complex with 150-fold higher affinity than the diastereomer BIO-2007818. High-affinity binding requires the presence of pUb. The K211N mutation in the RING0 pUb/pUbl-binding site prevents high-affinity binding. BIO-2007817 also binds to the R0RB:pUbl complex. Inclusion of ACT element with pUbl decreases the affinity of BIO-2007817 10-fold. The F146Y mutation in RING0 ACT-binding site decreases the affinity 80-fold. pUbl binds weakly to R0RB. Inclusion of BIO-2007817 increases the affinity of pUbl binding by 2400-fold. Protein concentrations and binding parameters are given in Supplementary Table.\n\nWe next asked if pUb was required for BIO-2007817 binding. In the absence of pUb, the affinity was decreased over 5000-fold (to the limit of detection), mirroring the requirement for pUb observed in autoubiquitination experiments. Loss of the RING0 pUb-binding site (due to the K211N mutation) similarly prevented binding. Although BIO-2007817 had no effect on phosphorylated parkin, surprisingly, the phosphorylated Ubl domain (pUbl) added in trans could replace pUb. In ITC experiments, BIO-2007817 bound to the R0RB:pUbl complex with the same affinity as the pUb complex. As the R0RB fragment does not undergo any conformational rearrangements and pUbl binds only to RING0, this suggests that BIO-2007817 binds at the RING0/pUb (or RING0/pUbl) interface.\n\nAdditional insight into the site of BIO-2007817 binding came from the observation that inclusion of the ACT region with the pUbl domain (pUbl-ACT) decreased the affinity of BIO-2007817 binding 10-fold. In contrast, in the absence of compound, the ACT improves the affinity of pUbl binding to R0BR three-fold. This suggests they compete for a common binding site. Identification of the binding site was confirmed by a mutation in ACT-binding site. Addition of a single oxygen atom (F146Y) decreased BIO-2007817 binding 10-fold. As F146 is surface-exposed and does not make contacts with pUb or pUbl in crystal structures of parkin, this strongly suggests that F146 directly binds BIO-2007817.\n\nTo directly test if BIO-2007817 behaves as a molecular glue, we measured the affinity of the pUbl domain binding to RING0 in the R0RB construct. As previously reported, pUbl in trans has low micromolar affinity. This contrasts with the situation in intact phosphorylated parkin when the pUbl domain is present in cis. Inclusion of a saturating concentration (200\u2009¬µM) of BIO-2007817 increased the pUbl binding affinity by more than three orders of magnitude, demonstrating that the compound acts as a molecular glue.\n\nMechanism of activation by THPP compounds\n\nHydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) has been instrumental for characterizing the conformational changes during parkin activation. HDX-MS measures solvent exposure which provides information on protein structure and interdomain contacts. We performed a series of HDX-MS experiments to resolve the mechanism of parkin activation by THPP compounds. As previously observed, addition of pUb to parkin increased deuteration of the Ubl domain. This reflects the release of the Ubl from its binding site on RING1, which facilitates its phosphorylation by PINK1. There was no increase in deuteration of Rcat domain as pUb binding to RING1 is not sufficient to activate parkin. In contrast, addition of BIO-2007817 in the presence of pUb, increased deuteration of the catalytic Rcat domain, reflecting its release from RING0. The effect of BIO-2007817 was strictly dependent on the presence of pUb; no changes in parkin deuteration were observed upon addition of BIO-2007817 alone. The increase in Rcat exposure was also completely blocked by the K211N mutation that prevents pUb binding to RING0 or by substitution of BIO-2007818 with the inactive diastereomer. Thus, as observed in the autoubiquitination assays, the combined action of pUb and BIO-2007817 is required to activate parkin. This occurs through the release of the Rcat domain from its site on RING0 in a manner analogous to activation by parkin phosphorylation.\n\nCrystal structure of parkin R0RB:2√ópUb complex with BIO-1975900\n\nWe turned to crystallography to understand how BIO-2007817 acts as a molecular glue. As crystallization trials with BIO-2007817 were unsuccessful, we expanded the screen to include related compounds with different ethanone substituents. We obtained crystals with the compound BIO-1975900 bound to rat parkin R0RB with two pUb and solved the structure by molecular replacement. BIO-1975900 is composed of a central tetrahydropyrazolo-pyrazine core, decorated by a tetrahydroquinoline head and a benzyl and ethanone tail. It has roughly 20-fold lower affinity with an EC50 of 2.9\u2009¬µM in in vitro TR-FRET activity assays compared to 0.15\u2009¬µM for BIO-2007817.\n\nThe crystal structure of rat R0RB:2√ópUb with BIO-1975900. The compound binds a hydrophobic groove composed of three regions: a RING0 W183 pocket, a P180 pocket, and a pUb K48 pocket. The tetrahydroquinoline group contacts F146, P180, W183, and V186. Replacement of F146 by tyrosine introduces a polar group and disrupts binding as observed in ITC experiments. The ethanone group inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by parkin RING0 residues L162, V164, L176, P180, and F208. The benzyl moiety extends to sit in a pocket sandwiched between the L176 residues of RING0 and residue K48 of the pUb molecule bound to RING0. In the difference density, we also identified a glycerol molecule from the cryoprotectant bound near the THPP central ring. The glycerol bridges the backbone amide of L162 and the guanidino group of R163 in the RING0 phosphoserine binding site.\n\nWe used NMR spectroscopy to confirm that BIO-1975900 and BIO-2007817 bind at the same location. The proton NMR spectrum shows similar chemical shift changes in the downfield region upon addition of the two compounds. 2D NMR with 15N-labeled R0RB:2√ópUb protein confirmed that the shifting signal was from W183, which is the only tryptophan present in R0RB:2√ópUb. Addition of half an equivalent of BIO-2007817 to 15N-labeled R0RB:2√ópUb split the W183 side chain signal at 10.2 ppm into two peaks, indicative of slow-exchange kinetics typical for nanomolar binding affinity. Addition of excess of BIO-2007817 shifted the signal to 10.5 ppm, as observed in the 1D spectra. The downfield chemical shift change arises from the interaction between the tetrahydroquinoline moiety of either BIO-2007817 or BIO-1975900 and the W183 side chain. This confirms that BIO-2007817 binds at the RING0/pUb interface in the same manner as BIO-1975900.\n\nThe crystal structure highlights the importance of the hydrophobic groove that binds BIO-1975900 for controlling parkin activity. In autoinhibited structures of parkin, Rcat residues bind the groove: W462 forms hydrophobic interactions with RING0 while F463 contacts RING0 W183. The F463 is positioned almost identically to the tetrahydroquinoline group of BIO-1975900. BIO-2007817 and Rcat compete for binding the same site on RING0.\n\nThe structure also explains the competition observed in ITC experiments between ACT and BIO-2007817 binding. The ACT, formed by residues 102‚Äì109 in the Ubl-R0RBR linker, binds to the same hydrophobic groove than BIO-1975900, as observed in the active, phosphorylated parkin:pUb structure. The molecular mimicry between the compound and the hydrophobic residues of the ACT element explains, in part, why the compound is unable to increase the activity of phosphorylated parkin.\n\nThe importance of the hydrophobic groove in parkin activation has been observed before. The mutation F146A weakens the hydrophobic interaction with Rcat F463 and, consequently, promotes parkin activation. Cells transfected with the F146A mutant showed increased recruitment of parkin to mitochondria and mitophagy. The F146A mutation also rescues mitochondrial recruitment and mitophagy in parkin mutants with defective Ubl or RING0 pUbl/pUb-binding sites.\n\nStructure-activity relationship of THPP compounds\n\nWe used molecular docking to explore the structure-activity relationship of related THPP compounds. Parkin activity was previously determined for compounds from two subseries: BIO-2007817-related subseries 1, which has an isopropyl group attached to its pyrazolo-pyrazine moiety, and BIO-1975900-related subseries 2, in which the isopropyl is replaced by a benzyl group. Additional compounds from both subseries were selected to rationalize how chemical modifications in the three interaction regions affect their activity. To validate the protocol, BIO-1975900 was first docked into the R0RB:2√ópUb crystal structure using the standard precision ligand docking module in Glide. The docked compound had favorable energies and superimposed well (less than 0.3\u2009√Ö deviation) with the experimentally determined structure.\n\nSubseries 1-compound BIO-2007817 was docked into the prepared R0RB:2√ópUb protein grid. NMR experiments with BIO-2007817 revealed hindered rotation with the methoxy-methylpyrazine-ethanone moiety adopting cis and trans conformations. In the docked structure, BIO-2007817 is in the cis conformation, suggesting a conformationally locked compound could likely improve potency further. The isopropyl moiety points towards parkin V164 and L176 and the methoxy-methylpyrazine-ethanone groups are adjacent to the positively charged side chain of pUb K48, forming a cation-pi interaction. The pi-stacking interactions between tetrahydroquinoline group and W183 and F146 are similar to BIO-1975900. In the weakly binding BIO-2007818 diastereomer, the oxygen of the methoxy group points away from pUb K48. The loss of the electrostatic interaction is reflected in lower docking and MM-GBSA scores compared to BIO-2007817. Replacement of the methoxy and methyl-pyrazolyl groups with a phenyl moiety (BIO-1966561) also decreased the docking score and EC50.\n\nDocking of BIO-1983977 demonstrates that the hydrophobic diisobutylamine functional group fits in the W183 pocket. The predicted binding is weaker than compound BIO-1966561 (identical except for the tetrahydroquinoline head group) but BIO-1983977 was similar in biochemical assays. The inactive compounds BIO-1967660 and BIO-1979167 could not be docked due to steric clashes with the sides of the W183 pocket.\n\nModulation of compound interactions with the parkin P180 pocket was investigated by docking subseries 2 compounds which are most closely related to the crystallized ligand BIO-1975900. In contrast to the ethanone group of BIO-1975900, which showed limited interactions with the P180 pocket, the methylsulfonamide moiety of BIO-2006661 formed a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of pUb A46. The additional interaction would explain the higher potency of BIO-2006661 relative to BIO-1975900. BIO-2008218, which contains a difluoro-ethanone moiety, showed a similar increase in potency. Positioning of the subseries 2 benzyl group was critical for binding. BIO-1975902, BIO-2006664, and BIO-2008219, R-enantiomers of active S-compounds, were inactive in biochemical assays and could not be docked. In general, the calculated binding interactions correlated well with the biochemical EC50, suggesting that docking could be used for shape-based screening of new parkin activators.\n\nBIO-2007817 rescues ubiquitination and mitophagy by parkin Ubl mutants\n\nThe observation that BIO-2007817 can activate parkin in the presence of pUb suggested that it might rescue the activity of parkin variants without a functional Ubl domain. We tested this hypothesis using an in organello assay that measures parkin ubiquitination of the mitochondrial protein mitofusin-2 (Mfn2). As substrate ubiquitination and autoubiquitination rates can differ, it was important to test the activity of the compounds on a physiologically relevant substrate. In the assay, HeLa cells are stimulated by treatment with mitochondria depolarizer CCCP and then the mitochondria are isolated and added ex vivo to a ubiquitination reaction mix including parkin with or without activator compounds.\n\nWithout CCCP, there was no ubiquitination of the Mfn2 substrate due to the absence of PINK1 and pUb. In contrast, CCCP-treatment led to an accumulation of PINK1, which led to parkin recruitment, phosphorylation/activation, and Mfn2 ubiquitination. In both conditions, addition of BIO-2007817 had no effect, in agreement with autoubiquitination assays with phospho-parkin and previous mitochondrial translocation and mitophagy assays. BIO-2007817 was able to partially rescue Mfn2 ubiquitination by non-phosphorylatable parkin variants, either S65A or R0RBR, which lacks the Ubl domain. At 10\u2009¬µM BIO-2007817, the fraction of total ubiquitination for Mfn2 was roughly 50% that of wild-type parkin.\n\nWe next asked if BIO-2007817 could rescue pathological mutations that impair parkin activity. R42P and V56E both affect the Ubl domain to destabilize its folding and impair mitophagy in cells in response to CCCP treatment. BIO-2007817 at 10\u2009¬µM effectively suppressed the ubiquitination defect of both mutations. The suppression was limited to Ubl mutations: neither R275W nor K211N showed enhanced activity in the presence of BIO-2007817. R275W occurs in the RING1 domain, disrupting parkin stability and possibly pUb binding. The lack of effect on the K211N mutant recapitulates the conclusions of autoubiquitination and Ub-VS assays that pUb-binding is essential for activation by BIO-2007817. The rescue of Mfn2 ubiquitination was selective. We did not observe rescue of either R42P and V56E by the diastereomer BIO-2007818 that differs at only one chiral center. Taken together, the in organello results show that mutations (ŒîUbl, R42P, V56E, S65A) that affect the parkin Ubl domain can be rescued by BIO-2007817.\n\nWe turned to mitoKeima assays to confirm this result and assess the ability of BIO-2007817 to derepress non-phosphorylatable parkin mutants which do not normally induce mitophagy in cells. The assay measures mitophagy using mitochondrially targeted fluorescent protein (mitoKeima) that shifts its excitation spectrum when mitochondria enter the acidic environment of lysosomes. Depolarization of mitochondria by CCCP led to robust mitophagy in cells expressing wild-type parkin with or without 1\u2009h pre-exposure to BIO-2007817. Cells expressing non-phosphorylatable S65A parkin or ‚àÜUbl parkin showed only partial mitophagy that was enhanced by BIO-2007817. PD mutations destabilizing parkin Ubl (R42P and V56E) and reducing mitophagy response to CCCP, could be rescued by pre-treatment with BIO-2007817. In agreement with our previous findings, the importance of RING0 pUb/pUbl binding site in BIO-2007817 activation of parkin was confirmed by the complete loss of mitophagy response in K211N mutant which could not be rescued by the compound.\n\nBased on our results, we propose a mechanism of activation of parkin by BIO-2007817 or THPP compounds. In the case of parkin with impaired Ubl, the THPP compound can allosterically promote the binding of pUb onto RING0 through bridging between parkin and pUb. When parkin Ubl can be phosphorylated by PINK1, the THPP binding site is already occupied by the ACT following pUbl relocalization to RING0. This explains the lack of activation effect of THPP on wild-type parkin observed in in organello and mitophagy assays, as well as in previously reported cell assays.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBoosting the activity of parkin using small molecule drugs has been proposed as a potential treatment for Parkinson‚Äôs disease. To do so, the molecules need to shift the inactive/active equilibrium toward the active conformation by rearrangement of the Ubl and Rcat domains. Several point mutations that increase parkin activity have been suggested as models for the design of parkin activators. The mutations W403A and F146A increase the activity of unphosphorylated parkin by disrupting inhibitory interactions. W403A weakens the REP-RING1 interaction while F146A disrupts the RING0-Rcat interface. Both are strongly activating in in vitro and cellular experiments and can suppress some naturally occurring EOPD parkin mutations. Unfortunately, no small molecule activators mimicking those mutations have been identified so far. One possible explanation is that many of the parkin surfaces are multifunctional which creates additional constraints for small molecule binders. A compound facilitating the release of Ubl from RING1 could accelerate the phosphorylation of Ubl by PINK1 and its relocalization to RING0; however, it cannot interfere with the E2-binding site, which overlaps with the Ubl domain. It also cannot inhibit the Ubl domain‚Äôs ability to act as a substrate for PINK1 or hinder the phosphorylated domain from binding to RING0. Similarly, a compound facilitating the release of Rcat from RING0 shouldn‚Äôt compete with the physiological pathways of activation. If binding RING0, it shouldn‚Äôt block pUb or pUbl binding. If binding Rcat, it shouldn‚Äôt prevent the transthiolation step of ubiquitin transfer from the E2 to the Rcat cysteine or the subsequent step of ubiquitin transfer to the substrate lysine. THPP compounds were identified in a biochemical screen with unphosphorylated parkin and pUb, not with phosphorylated parkin. As such, the compounds circumvent these problems by acting as a molecular glue to promote a minor activation mechanism in which pUb substitutes for pUbl. This avoids interfering with the activation and catalytic steps necessary for parkin function.\n\nAn additional consideration for the design of parkin activators is avoiding excessive or inappropriate activation. Phosphorylated parkin is highly active and ubiquitinates proteins indiscriminately, including itself. Compound BIO-2007817 amplifies an existing activation mechanism to obtain activation in a regulated way. BIO-2007817 is not a direct activator of parkin since it has a low affinity for parkin in the absence of pUb. The pUb-dependent activation is only functional upon parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria displaying pUb. In in vitro ubiquitination assays, activity was detected only in the presence of pUb and functional pUb-binding site.\n\nBinding both parkin and pUb, BIO-2007817 belongs to a growing class of molecules known as molecular glues. Chemically diverse, they share the property of directing a protein-protein interaction often with therapeutic goal. Cyclosporin, rapamycin, and thalidomide are among the best-known examples. Targeted protein degradation through the linking of ubiquitin ligases and substrate proteins is a particularly exciting application, although molecular glues can also act to inhibit ligase activity. Here, we observed the compounds act as activators through linking pUb and the RING0 domain to shift parkin toward its active conformation. The binding site of the compounds in hydrophobic groove between pUb and RING0 is a strategic location. In the inactive conformation, the groove is occupied by elements of the Rcat domain, while in the phosphorylated active conformation, it is occupied by the ACT element.\n\nThe identification of a hot spot for parkin activators lays the basis for further development. BIO-2007817 exists in two conformations in solution so constraining it to the bound conformation should improve its potency. The BIO-1975900 crystal structure points to other improvements. BIO-1975900 mimics the shape of the hydrophobic groove but does not fully occupy the region between RING0 and pUb. Notably, the chiral methoxy-methylpyrazine group, which makes important contributions to the binding affinity, is not present in the crystal structure. Instead, there is a well-ordered glycerol molecule that interacts with L162 and R163 of RING0. The glycerol could be linked to the methyl-pyrazolyl moiety to boost the solubility and affinity of BIO-1975900. More generally, the small number of hydrogen bonds in hydrophobic groove suggests that higher affinity molecules are possible by enhancing salt bridge and H-bond interactions.\n\nFinally, while THPP compounds are not universal activators of parkin, we note that their selectivity in rescuing parkin Ubl mutations could be an advantage for patients with those specific mutations. BIO-2007817 increases mitophagy in cells transfected with parkin mutants with defective Ubl domains. Generalized activation of parkin is unlikely to be a viable therapeutic strategy due to parkin‚Äôs lack of substrate selectivity. As selective inducers, THPP compounds are promising leads for personalized medicine for patients with certain naturally occurring parkin mutations.\n\nMethods\n\nCloning, expression, and purification of recombinant proteins in E. coli\n\nSingle-point mutations and deletions were generated using PCR mutagenesis (Agilent) and proteins expressed in BL21 (DE3) E. coli. Purification of full-length parkin, R0RBR, R0RB:2√ópUb, pUb‚àÜG76, pUbl, pUbl-ACT, UbcH7, Tc-PINK1, and human His-E1 were done using methods previously described. Briefly, proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Cytiva) or Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography, followed by either 3C protease cleavage to remove the GST tag or Ulp protease cleavage to remove the His-SUMO tag. Size-exclusion chromatography was used as a last step. 15N-labeled rat R0RB and pUb were produced in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 15NH4Cl. Phosphorylated Ub and Ubl were produced and purified according to published procedures. Purified proteins were verified using SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using UV absorbance.\n\nUbiquitination assays\n\nThe autoubiquitination assays of full-length and R0RBR parkin were performed at 22\u2009¬∞C for 60\u2009min by adding 2\u2009¬µM full-length WT, K211N or H302A A320R parkin or R0RBR, to 50\u2009nM human His-Ube1, 2\u2009¬µM UbcH7, 100\u2009¬µM ubiquitin in 50\u2009mM Tris pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM TCEP, 0.4% DMSO, 5\u2009mM ATP and 10\u2009mM MgCl2. Where indicated, pUb without the C-terminal glycine (pUbŒîG76) was used. When stated, 2\u2009¬µM of pUbŒîG76 and/or 200\u2009¬µM BIO-2007817 were added to the sample. pUbŒîG76 was used to prevent incorporation of pUb by E1 into the ubiquitination reaction. Reactions were stopped by the addition of reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer and the level of ubiquitination was analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie blue. Phosphorylated full-length parkin in complex with pUb was used as positive control.\n\nUbiquitin vinyl sulfone assays\n\nTo assess the effect of compounds on Ub-VS-charging of parkin at a fixed pUb concentration, 2\u2009¬µM parkin (either WT or K211N mutant) were incubated at 25\u2009¬∞C for 2\u2009h in the presence of 10\u2009¬µM Ub-VS (R&D Systems), 3\u2009¬µM pUb, at the following compound concentrations of BIO-2007817 (0\u2009¬µM, 0.09\u2009¬µM, 0.27\u2009¬µM, 0.8\u2009¬µM, 2.5\u2009¬µM, 7.4\u2009¬µM, 22.2\u2009¬µM, 66.7\u2009¬µM, and 200\u2009¬µM) in 50\u2009mM HEPES, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM TCEP, pH 8.0 containing 2%(v/v) DMSO. Reactions were stopped by addition of reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer and the level of cross-linking was analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie blue.\n\nIsothermal titration calorimetric assays\n\nITC measurements were carried out at 20\u2009¬∞C using VP-ITC (Microcal). The composition of the cell and syringe components are given in Supplementary Table. Titrations were performed with either 28 injections of 10 Œºl or 42 or 48 injections of 6 Œºl in 50\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM TCEP, 0.33% DMSO, pH 7.4. Data were modeled using a single set of identical sites using Origin v7 software.\n\nHDX-MS\n\nParkin (15\u2009¬µM) with additions of 15\u2009¬µM pUb and 600\u2009¬µM THPP compounds (diluted from 10\u2009mM in 100% DMSO) were incubated at RT for 30\u2009min in 25\u2009mM Tris, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 1\u2009mM TCEP-HCl, pH 8. Deuterium labeling was initiated by diluting the solution 7-fold (v/v) with D2O buffer (25\u2009mM Tris, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 1\u2009mM TCEP-HCl, pD 7.6) at room temperature. After different time intervals, labeling was quenched by addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 2\u2009M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.6% formic acid, pH 2.6. Inline digestion and peptide separation were conducted on a Waters nanoACQUITY system with HDX sample manager. 30 to 40 pmol of sample were injected on a pepsin immobilized column (2.1\u2009mm √ó 30\u2009mm, Waters, Milford, MA) with a flow rate of 100\u2009¬µl/min in 0.1% formic acid at 15\u2009¬∞C. The proteolytic peptides were trapped on a VanGuard Pre-Column (2.1\u2009mm √ó 5\u2009mm, ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18, 1.7\u2009¬µm, Waters) for 2\u2009min. The trap was then placed in line with an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7\u2009¬µm, 1.0 √ó 100\u2009mm, Waters), and an 3‚Äì35% gradient of acetonitrile over 11\u2009min at a flow rate of 50\u2009¬µl/min was used to separate the peptides at 0.4\u2009¬∞C. Formic acid (0.1%) was added to both mobile phases to maintain a pH of 2.5. Mass accuracy was maintained through continuous lock-mass correction using a Glu-fibrinogen B peptide standard (Sigma). Mass determination was performed on a Waters Synapt G2S Q-Tof mass spectrometer and the amounts of deuterated and undeuterated peptides analyzed using Waters DynamX 3.0. The data were not corrected for back-exchange.\n\nCrystallization and structure determination\n\nCrystals of R0RB:2√ópUb in complex with BIO-1975900 were grown using hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 0.3\u2009¬µl of protein complex at 10\u2009mg/ml (230\u2009¬µM) supplemented with 400\u2009¬µM of BIO-1975900 in 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.7\u2009mM TCEP, 4% (v/v) DMSO with 0.3\u2009¬µl of 0.2\u2009M NaCl, 0.1\u2009M HEPES pH 7.5, 25% (w/v) PEG 3350 at 4\u2009¬∞C. Crystals appeared after 9 days. After 3 weeks, crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor supplemented with 25% (v/v) glycerol before being cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen.\n\nDiffraction data was collected at the CMCF beamline 08ID-1 at the Canadian Light Source. A total of 1800 images were collected with an oscillation angle of 0.2¬∞ at 0.953\u2009√Ö. Reflections were integrated and scaled using XDS package. The diffraction data were phased by molecular replacement using R0RB and two pUb molecules from PDB deposition 7US1 as search model using Phaser implemented in PHENIX, and the structure was refined using PHENIX package and the model building was performed using COOT. Calculated Ramachandran values for the final structure are 98.1% of residues in the favored region and 0% outliers.\n\nNMR experiments\n\nFor 1D NMR spectra, 60 ŒºM of either BIO-2007817 or BIO-1975900 was added to 50 ŒºM unlabeled rat R0RB:2√ópUb in 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 120\u2009mM NaCl, 0.5\u2009mM TCEP, 4% DMSO, pH 7.4 and spectra acquired for 8\u2009h. For 2D NMR spectra, 14 ŒºM and 32 ŒºM of BIO-2007817 were added to 28 ŒºM 15N-labeled rat R0RB:2√ópUb in 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 120\u2009mM NaCl, 0.5\u2009mM TCEP, 1% DMSO, pH 7.4. 1H-15N correlation spectra were acquired for 16\u2009h. For the characterization of the cis-trans isomerization of BIO-2007817, 0.5\u2009mM of the compound was dissolved in a buffer containing 1% DMSO, 10% D2O, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4. Resonances were assigned using 2D 1H-1H DQF-COSY and 13C-1H HSQC spectra in the aromatic and aliphatic regions. The EXSY experiment was acquired on the same sample using a 2D 1H-1H NOESY pulse sequence with a 500 msec mixing time. All acquisitions were done at 25\u2009¬∞C at 600\u2009MHz on a Bruker spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance (1H, 13C, 15N) cryoprobe.\n\nCompound synthesis and characterization\n\nSynthesis of compounds BIO-1966561, BIO-2007817, and BIO-2007818 was described previously. See Supplementary Methods in the Supplementary Information for the synthesis of compounds: BIO-1983977, BIO-1979167, BIO-1967660, BIO-1975900, BIO-1975902, BIO-2008218, BIO-2008219, BIO-2006661, and BIO-2006664. Compounds were >95% pure as determined by LC/MS analysis.\n\nDocking\n\nThe co-crystal structure of BIO-1975900 was used as a starting point for docking. The protein was prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard accessible from Maestro interface of the Schrodinger 2019-3 suite at a pH of 7.0. The hydrogen atom positions were added and optimized using OPLS3e force field. The optimization was done in the absence of the ligand. Crystal waters, not interacting with the ligand were removed from the receptor structure. Only hydrogen atoms were minimized while the heavy atoms were kept fixed. Ligands were prepared using LigPrep utility in Schrodinger using OPLS3e force field as well. Protein grid was generated using Receptor Grid Generation utility in Glide for assigning the ligand position in the binding pocket. Docking of ligands was performed using standard precision (SP) ligand docking module in Glide. In the advanced setting of the docking panel, we performed enhanced conformational sampling for ligand conformer generation by increasing it to 4 times. We also checked the expanded sampling option during selection of initial poses so that more poses pass through the initial Glide screens.\n\nThe Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born/Surface Area (MM-GBSA) method is slightly more complex than docking calculations as it computes ligand strain and solvation and therefore adds more accuracy to the protein-ligand binding prediction. MM-GBSA calculations were performed directly from Maestro interface using Prime. The solvation model used for the ligand was VSGB 2.1 with OPLS4 force field. Protein residues were kept rigid for the calculation and the default minimization was used for the protein sampling method.\n\nIn organello assays\n\nAssays were performed as described previously. HeLa cells treated with 10\u2009mM CCCP or DMSO for 3\u2009h were suspended in mitochondrial isolation buffer (MIB) (20\u2009mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 220\u2009mM mannitol, 10\u2009mM KAc and 70\u2009mM sucrose) on ice. Cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation, and cell homogenates were centrifuged at 500\u2009√ó\u2009g for 5\u2009min at 4\u2009¬∞C to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant. Cytosolic fractions were collected by two further centrifugation steps for 15\u2009min at 4\u2009¬∞C at 12,000\u2009√ó\u2009g. Mitochondria pellets were suspended in MIB to a concentration of 2\u2009mg/ml and stored at ‚àí80\u2009¬∞C.\n\nFive micrograms of CCCP- or DMSO-treated mitochondria were supplemented with a ubiquitination reaction mix (100\u2009nM E1, 200\u2009nM of UbcH7, 5\u2009mM Ub, 1\u2009mM ATP, 5\u2009mM MgCl2 and 50 ŒºM TCEP in MIB), 200\u2009nM of recombinant WT or mutant human parkin and 10\u2009¬µM of BIO2007817, BIO2007818 or some MIB buffer with equivalent DMSO concentration into a final 10\u2009Œºl reaction volume. After a 10-min incubation at 37\u2009¬∞C, reactions were stopped with reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane for Western blotting analysis. Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with rabbit anti-Mfn2 (1:2000, mAb D2D10, Cell Signaling), mouse anti-parkin (1:40,000, mAb Prk8, Cell Signaling), or rabbit anti-VDAC (1:5000, mAb D73D12, Cell Signaling) diluted in TBS-T with 3% BSA. Membranes were washed with TBS-T and incubated with HRP-coupled horse anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:10,000, Cell Signaling). Detection was performed with Clarity Lightning ECL (Bio-Rad) and images acquired with a ImageQuant LAS 500 (GE Healthcare). The fraction of Mfn2 ubiquitination was quantified from western blot signals using Fiji, according to the formula f\u2009=\u2009(total ubiquitination)/(unmodified + total ubiquitination).\n\nMitophagy assay\n\nMitophagy was assessed using flow cytometry analysis of mitochondrially targeted mitoKeima as previously described. Briefly, U2OS cells stably expressing an ecdysone-inducible mitoKeima were induced with 10\u2009¬µM ponasterone A, transfected with GFP-parkin or parkin mutants for 20\u2009h, and treated (or not) with 20\u2009¬µM CCCP for 4\u2009h. Where indicated, cells were pre-treated with DMSO or 2.5\u2009¬µM BIO-2007817 1\u2009h prior to addition of CCCP. Cells were trypsinized, washed and resuspended in PBS prior to fluorescence‚Äêactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis on a Thermo Attune NxT cytometer (NeuroEDDU Flow Cytometry Facility, McGill University). Lysosomal mitoKeima was measured ratiometrically using excitation at 405\u2009nm and 561\u2009nm. For each sample, 100,000 events were collected, and single GFP-parkin-positive cells were gated for mitoKeima. Data were analyzed using FlowJo v10.7.2 (Tree Star). The percentage of cells with an increase in the 405:561\u2009nm ratio (i.e., cells within the upper gate) was quantified and normalized to the percentage observed in GFP-WT-parkin CCCP treated samples for each replicate.\n\nData availability\n\nSource data are provided with this manuscript as a Source data file.

Despite extensive research efforts, there have not been approved treatments to meet the significant needs of patients,‚Äù said Janet Maynard, MD, director of the Office of Rare Diseases, Pediatrics, Urologic and Reproductive Medicine (ORPURM), in the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ‚ÄúThe first-ever approval of a safe and effective drug option for NPC will undoubtedly support the essential medical needs of those suffering.‚Äù\n\nA rare genetic disease, NPC can result in progressive neurological symptoms and organ dysfunction. It originates from changes in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes, impacting the transport of cholesterol and other lipids in a cell, ultimately leading to organ damage. Evidence has shown patients affected by NPC only live for an average of 13 years.\n\nArimoclomol‚Äôs safety and effectiveness were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-month trial. A total of 50 patients aged 2‚Äì19 years, with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of NPC, were randomized 2:1 to weight-adjusted arimoclomol (31‚Äì124 mg) or oral placebo three times per day.\n\nOf the trial population, 39 (78%) received miglustat as background treatment. Efficacy was measured by the rescored 4-domain NPC Clinical Severity Scale (R4DNPCCSS) score, a measure of NPC disease progression, including ambulation, speech, swallow, and fine motor skills. Higher scores on the R4DNPCCSS indicate greater severity of NPC.\n\nUpon analysis, the R4DNPCCSS demonstrated the efficacy of arimoclomol in patients who received miglustat as background therapy. Arimoclomol achieved slower disease progression, as measured by the 4 domains, compared with placebo therapy.\n\nArimoclomol, in combination with miglustat, was indicated for oral treatment with or without food, according to the recommended dose based on a patient‚Äôs body weight. The drug‚Äôs prescription information warned of hypersensitivity reactions, including hives and angioedema, advising individuals who experience these reactions to halt use.\n\nFemale patients who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant were advised not to use arimoclomol. Based on safety data, the most common side effects linked to arimoclomol included upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and decreased weight.\n\nThe agency previously granted arimoclomol Priority Review, Orphan Drug, Rare Pediatric Disease, Fast Track, and Breakthrough Therapy designations for the treatment of NPC. In August, arimoclomol was the first product application discussed at the Genetic Metabolic Diseases Advisory Committee (GeMDAC), a committee established to advise the FDA on products used for the prevention or treatment of genetic metabolic diseases.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

Recent findings from the RHINE study suggest a significant link between gum bleeding and the development of respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD a decade later.\n\nKey insights include:\n\n- Self-reported gum bleeding is associated with increased odds of respiratory symptoms, particularly COPD and asthma.\n- Individuals reporting "often/always" gum bleeding had a 46% higher likelihood of developing COPD compared to those who never experienced it.\n- Periodontitis was present in 44% of those with frequent gum bleeding, highlighting the importance of oral health in overall well-being.\n- Among participants, 14.8% reported at least three asthma symptoms, with current asthma affecting 11.9% of the population.\n\nDr. Randi Bertelsen emphasizes that asking patients about gum bleeding can be a simple yet effective way to identify those at risk for respiratory issues. This connection underscores the need for healthcare providers to consider oral health as integral to overall health.\n\nAs we move forward, integrating dental health assessments into respiratory care could enhance patient outcomes.

Current asthma (defined as ‚Äúuse of asthma medication and/or asthma attack the last 12 months‚Äù) was reported by 11.9% of the total study population, chronic bronchitis (defined as ‚Äúbringing up phlegm almost every day for at least 3 months in 2 consecutive years‚Äù) was reported by 6.1% and COPD was reported by 2.1%, according to researchers.\n\nFurther, periodontitis was found in 44% of those who reported the occurrence of gum bleeding as ‚Äúoften/always‚Äù in RHINE III (n = 322). This disease was also observed in 31% of individuals who reported gum bleeding as ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù happening in RHINE III (n = 1,601).\n\n‚ÄúThe question ‚ÄòDo you bleed from your gums when you brush your teeth?‚Äô appears to be a very good marker of gum inflammation, with almost 50% of those with high gum bleeding frequency reporting periodontitis at follow-up,‚Äù Bertelsen told Healio.\n\nFollowing adjustment for sex, age, smoking, BMI and study center, researchers found heightened odds for self-reported COPD in RHINE IV with periodontitis (adjusted OR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.07-1.98). The presence of periodontitis also raised the odds for at least three asthma symptoms (aOR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.09-1.56).\n\n‚ÄúWe know that for bacteria, the mouth is the gateway to the respiratory tract and to the rest of the body. Therefore, it is not so unexpected to find this association,‚Äù Bertelsen told Healio.\n\nPeriodontitis was not linked to self-reported current asthma or chronic bronchitis in RHINE IV, according to researchers.\n\nSwitching to gum bleeding, researchers found that individuals reporting ‚Äúoften/always‚Äù vs. ‚Äúnever‚Äù gum bleeding in RHINE III had a greater likelihood for at least three asthma symptoms, COPD and bronchitis in RHINE IV. Bertelsen told Healio this was a surprising finding.\n\n‚ÄúIt is important that we start to consider the mouth as part of the rest of the body,‚Äù Bertelsen said. ‚ÄúThere is a strong connection between oral health and overall health and all health care providers should keep this in mind when seeing patients.\n\n‚ÄúThe advantage of the current study is that it allows us to follow-up a large general population with questionnaires designed to see how health status and behavior changes over time and that we have several study centers from different countries, which also gives valuable information and more strength to our findings,‚Äù Bertelsen added.\n\nLooking ahead, lung function measures and dental records should be incorporated into research on this topic, Bertelsen told Healio.\n\n‚ÄúFuture studies with thorough or objectively measured periodontal health status and respiratory status, including lung function, will be important,‚Äù Bertelsen said. ‚ÄúWe have studies ongoing where we are doing this, both an oral health intervention study for exploring the effect on lung function and studies where we have thorough dental examinations and oral bacteria samples that are linked to lung function and respiratory health status.‚Äù\n\nSources/Disclosures\n\nSource:\n\nBertelsen R, et al.

A starch- and sucrose-reduced diet (SSRD) has shown similar promising effects. The primary aim of this randomized, non-inferiority study was to test SSRD against low FODMAP and compare the responder rates (RR = ‚àÜTotal IBS-SSS ‚â• ‚àí50) to a 4-week dietary intervention of either diet. Secondary aims were to estimate responders of ‚â•100 score and 50% reduction; effects on extraintestinal symptoms; saturation; sugar craving; anthropometric parameters; and blood pressure. 155 IBS patients were randomized to SSRD (n = 77) or low FODMAP (n = 78) for 4 weeks, with a follow-up 5 months later without food restrictions. The questionnaires Rome IV, IBS-severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), and visual analog scale for IBS (VAS-IBS) were completed at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks and 6 months. Weight, height, waist circumference, and blood pressures were measured. Comparisons were made within the groups and between changes in the two groups. There were no differences between groups at baseline. The responder rate of SSRD was non-inferior compared with low FODMAPs at week 2 (79.2% vs. 73.1%; p = 0.661; 95% confidence interval (CI) = ‚àí20‚Äì7.2) and week 4 (79.2% vs. 78.2%; p = 1.000; 95% CI = ‚àí14‚Äì12). Responder rate was still high when defined stricter. All gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms were equally improved (p < 0.001 in most variables). SSRD rendered greater reductions in weight (p = 0.006), body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.005), and sugar craving (p = 0.05), whereas waist circumference and blood pressure were equally decreased. Weight and BMI were regained at follow-up. In the SSRD group, responders at 6 months still had lowered weight (‚àí0.7 (‚àí2.5‚Äì0.1) vs. 0.2 (‚àí0.7‚Äì2.2) kg; p = 0.005) and BMI (‚àí0.25 (‚àí0.85‚Äì0.03) vs. 0.07 (‚àí0.35‚Äì0.77) kg/m2; p = 0.009) compared with baseline in contrast to non-responders. Those who had tested both diets preferred SSRD (p = 0.032). In conclusion, a 4-week SSRD intervention was non-inferior to low FODMAP regarding responder rates of gastrointestinal IBS symptoms. Furthermore, strong reductions of extraintestinal symptoms were found in both groups, whereas reductions in weight, BMI, and sugar craving were most pronounced following SSRD.\n\n1. Introduction\n----------------\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common disorder of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) with a global prevalence of 4% according to the Rome IV criteria. Functional gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are observed in 40% of the general population. Most patients experience aggravated GI symptoms after food intake. The established treatment of IBS is dietary modification with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and low content of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP). Low FODMAP focus on reduction of lactose, fructose more than glucose, fructans, galacto-oligosaccharides, and polyols. Fermentable carbohydrates lead to increased small intestinal water content and colonic gas production, rendering abdominal distention and altered bowel habits. Since IBS is associated with visceral hypersensitivity, abdominal distention in these patients may lead to symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain. However, some patients complain about the complicated low FODMAP advice, and the challenge to personalize the diet. Reduction of several food items may lead to malnutrition in the long-term, although studies have shown good nutritional supply by low FODMAP. Furthermore, 25‚Äì50% of IBS patients still experience symptoms on a low FODMAP diet. Thus, there is a need for other treatment options as well in IBS.\n\nCongenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID) is considered a rare disease. During the last years, increased prevalence of rare variants of sucrase-isomaltase (SI) genes in IBS patients has been found and raised the hypothesis that a subgroup of IBS may represent enzymatic SI deficiency. When ingested sugars are not hydrolyzed and absorbed but accumulated in the bowel, the osmotic load is increased leading to retention and secretion of water and electrolytes into the lumen. In colon, the undigested sugars lead to fermentation. Thus, symptoms like flatulence, bloating, abdominal pain, and altered bowel habits are evoked. The treatment of SI deficiency is reduced intake of starch and sucrose. Supplementation of sacrosidase may be considered, but starch reduction is still necessary. The high consumption of sugar and processed food in the Western world may enhance the risk to develop symptoms by genetic variants of enzyme deficiency.\n\nDue to the recent findings, the efficacy of a starch- and sucrose-reduced diet (SSRD) has been examined in IBS, with marked improvement of symptoms. SSRD focus on reduction of sucrose, starch, and added sugar. Although some overlaps between the diets, the largest differences between low FODMAP and SSRD is that SSRD allows intake of fructan, fructose, lactose, and sweeteners, whereas low FODMAP is less restricted regarding sucrose and starch. The primary aim of the present non-inferiority study was to test SSRD against the established low FODMAP and compare the responder rates (RR = ‚àÜTotal IBS-SSS ‚â•‚àí50) to a 4-week dietary intervention of either diet. Secondary aims were to estimate the responder rates after 6 months and with score reductions of ‚â•100 or ‚â•50% in IBS-SSS from baseline; effects on extraintestinal symptoms; saturation; sugar craving; anthropometric parameters; and blood pressure.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n-------------------------\n\n#### 2.1. Study Design\n\nAn open randomized, non-inferior trial, with two parallel groups, was conducted at the Department of Internal Medicine, Sk√•ne University Hospital. Malm√∂, Sweden, between March 2022‚ÄìFebruary 2024. After a 10-day run-in period (baseline), a thorough physical examination was performed including auscultation of heart and lungs. A dietary intervention of either SSRD or low FODMAP was given for 4 weeks. When completing the intervention, participants received information about the diet not randomized to, which they were free to test, and were followed up 5 months later without any mandatory dietary restrictions during this time. However, participants in the low FODMAP group had to reintroduce FODMAP-containing food again, one by one, according to clinical routines. The study questionnaire, food diary, Rome IV, irritable bowel syndrome-severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), and visual analog scale for irritable bowel syndrome (VAS-IBS) were completed and abdominal palpation, weight, height, waist circumference, and blood pressure were measured at all three physical visits. IBS-SSS and VAS-IBS were also completed at home after 2 weeks of intervention.\n\n#### 2.2. Patients\n\nPatients with a diagnosis of IBS according to Rome IV and age 18‚Äì70 years with symptoms >175 scores on IBS-SSS, and without alcohol and/or drug abuses, current eating disturbances, pregnancy, presence of any organic GI disease, severe GI surgery in the past, severe organic and psychiatric diseases, severe food allergy, or on gluten-free-, vegan-, low FODMAP-, or low-carbohydrate high-fat (LCHF) diets were recruited to the study. Celiac disease was excluded by measuring transglutaminase antibodies at the Department of Clinical Chemistry.\n\nA detailed description of the recruitment process has been published. Briefly, a data search was performed from medical records in the County of Region Skane using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) revision 10 for patients who had received any of the diagnoses K58.1 (diarrhea-predominated IBS; IBS-D), K58.2 (constipation-predominated IBS; IBS-C), K58.3 (mixed IBS; IBS-M), and K58.8 (other and unspecified IBS; IBS-U) during 2019‚Äì2022. Of these, 744 were randomly contacted by letter and phone call. Information letters with leaflets for distribution to waiting rooms were sent to 203 primary healthcare centers (PCC) in the County and several lectures were held for healthcare staff. Campaigns in social media were performed by a professional company (Trialy, Gothenburg, Sweden), to recruit persons with a known diagnosis of IBS. From 300 eligible patients, 214 patients were randomized to either SSRD or low FODMAP according to block randomization (BR), and 155 (72.4% of randomized cases) could enter the dietary intervention since many did not come to first visit or did not fulfill inclusion criteria. This means an inclusion rate of 42.7% in the group from social media and 6.5% in the group from medical records. Seven of the included IBS patients had total IBS-SSS just below 175 but were included due to clear diagnosis of IBS.\n\n#### 2.3. Dietary Advice\n\nVerbal and written dietary advice were given at the first visit. Patients randomized to SSRD focused on starch- and sucrose reduction, and increased intake of certain fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, and dairy products. The dietary advice was modified from dietary guidelines for patients with CSID, and previously described in detail. Briefly, all sucrose-containing foods were to be avoided. One serving per day was allowed for (1) whole-grain bread or oatmeal porridge and (2) fiber-rich alternatives of rice or pasta. For those not tolerating fibers, smaller amounts of regular processed rice and pasta was allowed. Whole grains were recommended instead of processed breakfast cereals. Pork, beef, lamb, fish, turkey, chicken, and egg could be ingested without any restrictions. Processed meat such as bacon, sausage, and pies should be avoided if containing sugar or starch. Natural dairy products, but not oat milk and soya milk, were allowed. Butter and oil intake was unrestricted, but margarine should be avoided. Salt, pepper, and fresh herbs could be used unrestrictedly. Nuts and seeds were recommended in place of sugary snacks. Increased fat and/or protein intake and prolonged chewing was encouraged, to enhance salivary amylase breakdown of starch and to delay GI transport. Patients were provided lists of suitable fruits and vegetables with less starch content. No re-introduction procedure was considered after SSRD treatment.\n\nParticipants randomized to the low FODMAP received information how to avoid or reduce intake of fructans (e.g., wheat, onion, garlic), galacto-oligosaccharides (e.g., pulses), lactose (e.g., milk), fructose more than glucose (e.g., honey), and polyols (e.g., apples, pears) during the 4-week intervention. After the 4 weeks, they had to reintroduce FODMAP-containing food again, one by one, to finally find their personalized form of food, which is the routine procedure in the low FODMAP strategy, since the diet excludes several food items.\n\nBoth groups received recipes and menu suggestions to enable compliance to the diet. All participants had to continue with their ordinary energy intake, degree of physical activity, medications, probiotics, or supplements, without making any changes or introductions of new drugs or other diets. No advice was given regarding food intake frequency or regularity. The participants could reach the study staff by telephone or email throughout the study.\n\n#### 2.4. Questionnaires\n\n#### 2.4.1. Study Questionnaire\n\nAll study participants completed a questionnaire regarding sociodemographic factors, lifestyle habits, pregnancies and childbirth, medical history, drug treatments, and family history. Two 100 mm visual analog scales (VAS) were used to estimate saturation and sugar craving, respectively.\n\nFood intake was registered digitally for 3 days (Wednesday-Friday) at baseline, and at week 4 and month 6 at the platform called Riksmaten Flex 2021 of the Swedish Food Agency.\n\nScreening for symptoms of eating disorders was performed by the SCOFF (Sick, Control, One, Fat, Food) screening tool, which was also completed after 4 weeks and at follow-up.\n\n#### 2.4.2. Rome IV Questionnaire\n\nQuestions No 40‚Äì48 in the Swedish version of the Rome IV questionnaire was used, after having received license from The Rome Foundation, Inc. Raleigh, NC, USA.\n\n#### 2.4.3. Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Severity Scoring System\n\nAbdominal pain, abdominal distension, satisfaction with bowel habits, and the impact of bowel habits on daily life was estimated using VAS ranging from absent (0 mm) to very severe (100 mm) symptoms, and days with abdominal pain the last 10 days was reported. The maximum achievable score is 500. Scores ranging 75‚Äì174 indicate mild disease, 175‚Äì299 indicate moderate disease, and ‚â•300 indicate severe disease. Extraintestinal symptoms (nausea, difficulties to eat a whole meal, reflux, belching/excess wind, headache, back pain, leg pain, muscle/joint pain, urinary urgency, and fatigue) were estimated on VAS scales with maximal achievable score of 500.\n\n#### 2.4.4. Visual Analog Scale for Irritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nThe VAS-IBS covers the symptoms abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, bloating and flatulence, vomiting and nausea, psychological well-being, and intestinal symptoms‚Äô influence on daily life, ranging from absent (0 mm) to very severe (100 mm) symptoms. The values are inverted from the original version, and reference values for healthy controls are defined.\n\n#### 2.5. Statistical Analyses\n\nPower calculation was based on non-inferiority where SSRD was tested against a standard treatment (low FODMAP). Primary outcome was responder rate (RR = ‚àÜTotal IBS-SSS ‚â• ‚àí50) and was assumed to be 65% in both treatment groups at week 4. A difference in responder rate as large as 20% in favor of the standard treatment, would allow SSRD to be non-inferior. Sample size based on 80% power, a one-sided confidence level of 97.5% and an expected loss of follow-up of 10% to confirm non-inferiority was calculated to be 100 patients in each group. Due to few dropouts, the study was closed after inclusion of 155 patients, after a second consultation with the statistician.\n\nThe statistical calculations were performed as intention-to-treat in IBM SPSS, version 29. Two participants had acute gastroenteritis at the end of the 4-week period, why the questionnaires reflecting GI symptoms from the 2-week follow-up was used. According to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, anthropometric and symptom data were not normally distributed and therefore presented as median (interquartile ranges) or number (percentages). Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks, and Spearman‚Äôs correlation test was used for continuous variables and Fisher‚Äôs exact test was used for dichotomous variables, as well as Proportionality test for 95% confidence interval (CI). To adjust for multiple comparisons in the multiple comparison with baseline and correlations, crude p-values as well as the p-values adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR) set at 5% according to the Benjamin-Hochberg method were performed. Normally distributed data in nutritional variables were presented as mean ¬± standard deviation (SD) and calculated by Independent-Sample or Paired-Samples t-test. One sample t-test were used for proportional differences. ANOVA with Bonferroni correction was performed to calculate response differences due to IBS subgroups. p ‚â§ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n3. Results\n-----------\n\n#### 3.1. Basal Characteristics\n\nIn total, 155 patients were included in the study categorized as IBS-C (n = 26, 16.8%), IBS-D (n = 44, 28.4%), IBS-M (n = 54, 34.8%), IBS-U (n = 7, 4.5%), and unspecific functional bowel disorder (FBD) (n = 24, 15.5%) with weekly abdominal pain but weak (<30%) association between the pain and bowel habits. Seventy-seven participants were randomized to SSRD of which 72 (93.5%) completed the 4-week intervention in comparison to 72 (92.3%) of the 78 participants randomized to low FODMAP (p = 1.00). Fifty-three in the SSRD group (68.8%) and 49 (62.8%) in the low FODMAP group completed the 6-month follow-up (p = 0.499). There was no difference in sex distribution, age, weight, body mass index (BMI), sociodemographic factors, or lifestyle habits between groups.\n\nOverweight/obesity was observed in 50.3% of the participants. The most common comorbidities were eczema (n = 19, 12.3%), allergy (n = 17, 11.0%), and reflux/hiatus hernia (n = 18, 11.6%). The most used drugs were paracetamol (n = 54, 34.8%), proton pump inhibitors (n = 48, 31.0%), allergy medicines (n = 24, 15.5%), and hormonal anticonception (n = 24, 15.5%). As many as 55 participants (35.5%) were using any nutritional supply in the form of minerals and vitamins. At inclusion, 19 (12.3%) had gluten-reduced diet, 63 (40.6%) lactose-free diet, and 14 (9%) were vegetarians. Altogether, 78 (50.3%) were already on any food-restriction diet. Twenty-eight (18.1%) participants had a history of any eating disorders.\n\n#### 3.2. Gastrointestinal and Extraintestinal Symptoms\n\nThe compliance to diet seemed good, with reductions of energy, carbohydrates, sucrose, and monosaccharides in both groups, whereas starch, disaccharides, added sugar, and alcohol only were decreased in SSRD group. Protein intake was increased in the SSRD group (p = 0.002), whereas fiber intake was reduced (p = 0.001), and alcohol intake was increased at follow-up (p < 0.001), in the low FODMAP group. The reductions were most pronounced in the SSRD group for carbohydrates, sucrose, starch, disaccharides, and added sugar (p < 0.001 for all), with differences also in fat intake between groups (p = 0.007). The vast majority were responders to the diet, without any differences in the responder rate between the groups when calculated as intention-to-treat at week 2 (79.2% vs. 73.1%; p = 0.661; 95% CI = ‚àí20‚Äì7.2) and week 4 (79.2% vs. 78.2%; p = 1.000; 95% CI = ‚àí14‚Äì12). At follow-up, there was no significant difference between the responder rates in the groups when calculated by Fisher‚Äôs exact test (36.4% vs. 42.3%; p = 0.252), but when calculating the CI according to the non-inferior intention at 4 weeks, there was a borderline significance for SSRD at follow-up (95% CI = ‚àí9.4‚Äì21). Responder rate was still high when defined stricter (‚àÜTotal IBS-SSS ‚â•‚àí100), both at week 2 (63.6% vs. 52.6%), week 4 (67.5% vs. 65.4%), and month 6 (20.8% vs. 28.2%). Also, a considerable responder rate was found when defined as a 50% decrease of total IBS-SSS.\n\nCalculations per protocol showed similar results. There were fewer responders in those with a vegetarian diet when considering >100 points and 50% reduction of total IBS-SSS (p = 0.016 and p = 0.018, respectively). When calculating all who had any diet such as gluten-reduced, lactose-free, or vegetarians, the 50% responder rate was lower compared with those without any dietary restrictions (p = 0.031). Responders had slightly higher total IBS-SSS at baseline compared with non-responders both considering week 2, week 4, and month 6. Those who were responders (‚àÜTotal IBS-SSS ‚â•‚àí50) at 6 months in the SSRD group, were those who still had lowered weight and BMI compared with baseline.\n\nAll specific GI symptoms, as well as total IBS-SSS, decreased already after 2 weeks. The improvement remained in all symptoms except for constipation in the SSRD group. Adjustment for multiple comparisons by FDR did not change the results. The IBS-D group differed from IBS-C and IBS-M in improvements of diarrhea and from IBS-M in improvements of constipation in the SSRD group at week 4, whereas IBS-C differed from IBS-D and IBS-M in improvements of diarrhea in the low FODMAP group. About one-quarter of the participants were without symptoms after 4 weeks, and 40‚Äì50% experienced abdominal pain only 2‚Äì3 times/monthly after 6 months, thus, not fulfilling the IBS criteria.\n\nThe total burden of extraintestinal symptoms at baseline correlated with constipation, bloating and flatulence, vomiting and nausea, and impaired psychological well-being. All extraintestinal symptoms, except leg pain in the SSRD group, were improved after the dietary intervention, which remained throughout the study period in most variables. Adjustment for multiple comparisons by FDR did not change the results.\n\nThe effect on total IBS-SSS or extraintestinal IBS-SSS was not affected of gluten-reduced, lactose-free, or vegetarian diets. Categorization into age groups 18‚Äì39 years, 40‚Äì59 years, and 60‚Äì70 years, did not have any effect on responder rates of ‚â•50 scores reduction after SSRD or low FODMAP at week 4. There was a strong correlation between the improvements in total IBS-SSS and total extraintestinal IBS-SSS at both week 2, week 4 and month 6 and psychological well-being. Fatigue and belching/excess wind showed the strongest correlations among extraintestinal symptoms. After FDR adjustment, the significant correlations disappeared between changes of total IBS-SSS and headache at week 2, and of urinary urgency and muscle/joint pain at week 4.\n\nIn the SSRD group, there was a weak correlation between decreased bloating and disaccharide intake. In the low FODMAP group, there was a weak correlation between decreased bloating and monosaccharide and fiber intake, as well as decreased total IBS-SSS and monosaccharide intake. Sugar craving was decreased, especially following SSRD, whereas the degree of saturation was unaffected.\n\n#### 3.3. Anthropometric Data\n\nWeight and BMI were decreased in both groups but was most pronounced following SSRD. After the intervention, weight and BMI were regained, but waist circumference was still reduced after 6 months. The significant changes remained after adjustments for multiple comparisons by FDR. The difference in weight and BMI from baseline at month 6 correlated with the difference of total IBS-SSS.\n\n#### 3.4. Follow-Up\n\nBetween week 4 and month 6, participants were instructed to eat whatever they preferred. At month 6, the majority had only tested the diet they were initially randomized to. Of those 34 participants who had tested both diets, 22 preferred SSRD and 10 preferred low FODMAP, whereas 2 participants experienced the diets equal. The reason for preferring either diet was: easier to follow, had better effect, easier to follow and better effect, or other.\n\nIn the SSRD group, 28 had continued with a modified SSRD, 16 had returned to their ordinary diet, and the rest ingested a variety of different diets. In the low FODMAP group, 18 continued with a personalized low FODMAP, 23 had returned to their ordinary food habits, and the other ingested different diets. A greater portion of participants in the SSRD group planned to continue with a modified SSRD instead of returning to normal diet. In the low FODMAP group, the distribution between a continued personalized low FODMAP or normal diet was equal.\n\nAs a free comment, several participants mentioned how they had modified SSRD to avoidance of sucrose and restricted intake of bread, potatoes, rice, and pasta, which rendered sustained effect of the diet also at follow-up. Thus, these modifications were the easiest to adhere to, and the listed fruits, berries, and vegetables were of less importance in the long-term coherence.\n\n#### 3.5. Safety Outcomes\n\nAt baseline, high blood pressure was found in some patients, who were referred to the PCC. No adverse side effect was observed during the intervention, more than that one in the low FODMAP group had worse symptoms.\n\n4. Discussion\n--------------\n\nThe responder rate of the 4-week SSRD intervention regarding GI symptoms was not inferior to the responder rate of low FODMAP. Age did not affect responder rate, but those without any prior dietary restrictions had higher responder rate, as well as those in the SSRD group who still had lowered weight at month 6 compared with baseline. All specific GI symptoms, except constipation, were decreased throughout the study. A quarter of the participants had no symptoms after the 4-week intervention, and at follow-up 5 months later, 40‚Äì50% did not fulfill the IBS criteria but were classified as unspecific FBD or healthy. In addition, all extraintestinal symptoms, except leg pain in the SSRD group, were improved after the intervention, which remained throughout the study period in most variables. The improvements in total IBS-SSS correlated strongly with improvements in total extraintestinal IBS-SSS and psychological well-being. Fatigue and belching/excess wind showed the strongest correlations with improvement of total IBS-SSS among the extraintestinal symptoms. Sugar craving was reduced, especially after SSRD, whereas saturation was unaffected in both groups. Weight and BMI were reduced after 4 weeks, most pronounced after SSRD, but were regained at follow-up. Waist circumference was still reduced at follow-up, as was also the reduced diastolic blood pressure in the low FODMAP group. Of those who had tested both diets, most preferred SSRD since it was easier to adhere to and was experienced as more efficient.\n\nThe most pronounced dietary effect on IBS has been found in patients with higher GI symptoms, in line with the present findings. Extraintestinal symptoms, which correlated with specific GI symptoms, are common in IBS and may be as bothersome as the GI symptoms for the patient. Therefore, it is important to measure improvements in both GI and extraintestinal symptoms, to ensure an improved quality of life.\n\nThe objective of the present study was to compare the effect on symptoms of a starch- and sucrose reduction and a low FODMAP. As found in the diary books, although low FODMAP led to reduced intake of carbohydrates and sucrose, and both groups had the same extent of monosaccharide reduction, SSRD led to markedly more reductions of carbohydrates, sucrose, starch, disaccharides, and added sugar than low FODMAP. The greatest differences between the diets are gluten (due to fructan reduction)- and lactose restrictions in low FODMAP but not in SSRD. However, there are many overlaps between current diets. There are also overlaps regarding mechanisms behind the symptoms, with attempts to reduce accumulation of carbohydrates in the bowel leading to increased amounts of gas and luminal water evoking flatulence and bloating, pain, and altered bowel habits. Maybe it is overload of carbohydrates per se that is most important, since a low-carbohydrate diet with higher amounts of protein and fat was equally efficient as low FODMAP. The current SSRD diet does not reduce the carbohydrate intake so dramatically as the former described low-carbohydrate diet. Thereby, the fat intake was not increased. Garlic, leek, and beans should be avoided in both diets. Also, low FODMAP renders lower starch and sucrose intake, since a lot of cakes and candies contain gluten and/or lactose, leading to avoidance of similar food items as SSRD. Furthermore, sucrose reduction leads to fructose reduction. The concept of avoiding sucrose and starch is easier to adhere to, in comparison to fermentable carbohydrates, which was reflected by the preference of SSRD both in the present and the first SSRD intervention. At follow-up, those who still adhered to SSRD experienced a markedly improvement of GI symptoms, and they had found out that avoidance of sucrose and reduction of bread, potatoes, rice, and pasta was enough to remain asymptomatic. Thus, the restrictions of other fruits, berries, and vegetables should be used by caution, to avoid unnecessary reduction of important micronutrients. The reduced weight and BMI in responders at 6 months in the SSRD group suggest better compliance in responders than non-responders.\n\nOur interventional study supports previous findings in a large population-based cohort (366,432 individuals) of the importance of human carbohydrate-active enzymes (hCAZyme) genotype in relation to IBS risk. SI genes codes for the brush-border disaccharidase sucrase-isomaltase that break down sucrose and starch whereas AMY1B and AMY2A code for amylase that break down starch into smaller sugars and disaccharides. Hypomorphic variants of SI, AMY1B, and AMY2A genes have been found to be associated with increased risk of IBS. Hence, reduced enzymatic activity may lead to excess carbohydrates in the bowel, leading to IBS symptoms through bacterial fermentation and osmosis. In alignment, decreased intake of disaccharides in the SSRD group correlated with less bloating. Future studies are warranted to identify the individual saccharides most likely to exert therapeutic effects, eventually in relation to their breakdown capacity in individual patients (i.e., battery of hCAZymes and relative efficiency of these). The marked improvement of symptoms after SSRD cannot be explained solely due to genetic variants. Other mechanisms such as microbiota modification, endocrine effects, and fructose intolerance may be involved, although more studies are needed to confirm the importance of these components.\n\nSeveral reports have shown that the symptoms in IBS patients are not explained by food allergy or food intolerances. Instead, poor dietary habits with food intake that trigger GI symptoms as well as leads to micronutrient deficiency are common in IBS. Therefore, overloading of the physiological mechanisms when ingesting Western processed food with additives of sugar and starch may be one cause of symptoms in a subset of IBS patients. Sugar has not only an adverse effect on GI symptoms but is also associated with overweight and obesity, leading to several diseases including metabolic diseases, pain hypersensitivity, and malignancies. A systematic review has shown obesity to be a risk factor for IBS, and IBS was associated with the metabolic syndrome in a large population-based study. This underlines the importance of reduced weight and blood pressure in IBS, and not only improvement of symptoms. Total sugar and fructose intake are associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality. Thus, decrease of carbohydrate intake, especially sucrose, is of benefit for the whole society. The high prevalence of previous eating disorders in IBS is in alignment with other studies.\n\nDue to the great challenge to recruit participants, the study was completed before 200 participants were included, which may have affected the statistical calculations. However, the study cohort is still big in comparison to several others. The main inclusion of participants from social media led to highly dedicated participants, with higher motivation than observed in the prior study when recruitment was performed from medical records. The high responder rate is in line with 83% responders by Mediterranean diet, and 50‚Äì80% by low FODMAP, with at least 50% of individuals¬¥ experiencing symptom relief in the long term.\n\nOne of the strengths of the present study was the follow-up for another 5 months. The results suggest that IBS patient can be offered different diets depending on their preferences. The study has several limitations, one being that the power calculation was performed for the 4-week intervention. Thus, the high rate of dropouts at month 6, with most dropouts in the low FODMAP group, led to that an obvious non-inferiority for SSRD could not be shown in the long-term.\n\n5. Conclusions\n---------------\n\nIn conclusion, a 4-week SSRD intervention was non-inferior to low FODMAP regarding responder rates of gastrointestinal IBS symptoms. Furthermore, strong reductions of extraintestinal symptoms were found in both groups, whereas reductions in weight, BMI, and sugar craving were most pronounced following SSRD. Those who had tested both diets preferred SSRD, since it was easier to adhere to.\n\nSupplementary Materials\n-----------------------\n\nThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: [https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nu16173039/s1](https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nu16173039/s1), Supplementary Figure S1: CONSORT flow chart.

[tickborne diseases](https://www.ijidonline.com/action/doSearch?AllField=%22tickborne+diseases%22&journalCode=ijid)\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nLyme borreliosis (LB), an infection caused by the spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex (Bbsl), is the most common tick-borne disease in Europe. Although LB commonly presents as erythema migrans (EM), Bbsl infection can disseminate resulting in Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), arthritis, or carditis.\n\nThe purposes of public health surveillance for LB include identifying geographic areas with a risk of disease transmission, monitoring disease trends, estimating disease burden, and supporting public health decision making. Many European countries publish LB surveillance data online. There are, however, marked differences in the approaches for LB surveillance between countries. Some countries conduct LB surveillance for both clinician-diagnosed and laboratory-diagnosed cases and include all clinical manifestations of LB (e.g., cases of EM and cases of disseminated LB). Other countries conduct surveillance only for laboratory-diagnosed disseminated LB cases or only for laboratory-diagnosed LNB cases. Most countries that conduct LB surveillance have governmental statutes that require notification of LB cases to public health authorities, but some countries conduct LB surveillance via voluntary sentinel networks of clinicians. In countries where LB is statutorily notifiable, the responsibility for reporting cases of LB varies; some countries require reporting by both clinicians and laboratories, some require reporting only by clinicians, and some require reporting only by laboratories. Furthermore, there are differences within and between countries on the ability of clinicians and laboratories to diagnose LB, contributing to differences in reporting of LB cases to surveillance. The marked differences in the approaches for LB surveillance between countries make it challenging to compare LB disease burden.\n\nRegardless of how LB surveillance is conducted, to be detected by surveillance a Bbsl-infected person must seek medical care; this is unlikely to occur if the infected individual does not have symptoms. To achieve the purposes of public health surveillance, LB surveillance systems do not need to detect all cases of symptomatic Bbsl infections. Reasons why a symptomatic Bbsl-infected individual may not be included in public health surveillance include that persons: (1) do not seek medical care, (2) seek medical care but are not diagnosed with LB, and (3) are diagnosed with LB but are not reported as a case to the surveillance system. Seroprevalence studies provide estimates of the prevalence of people with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies and are a useful tool for understanding the population-based LB burden. The aim of this study was to enable between-country comparisons of the incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection and improve the understanding of the LB disease burden in Europe by using data from seroprevalence studies, along with estimates of the symptomatic proportion and the duration of antibody detection and LB surveillance data, to estimate the incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection.\n\nMETHODS\n-------\n\nGeneral population seroprevalence studies were identified through two literature searches. The first literature search, which resulted in an article published in 2023, was a systematic literature review of literature of articles published from 2005‚àí2022. The second literature search, which was conducted to identify articles published prior to or after the first search, was a search of articles published in 1998‚àí2023. Details of the first search, including the PRISMA diagram, have been published; briefly the searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and CABI Direct (Global Health) and had no language restrictions and used the search terms ‚ÄúLyme‚Äù, ‚Äú_Borrelia_‚Äù, ‚Äúborreliosis‚Äù, and ‚Äúsurveillance.‚Äù If an identified seroprevalence study only reported on results obtained using a single-tier diagnostic testing protocol, the results were adjusted to estimate the seropositivity that would have been observed if a two-tier diagnostic testing protocol had been used. In addition to seroprevalence studies, LB surveillance data for countries in Europe were identified by searching public health institute websites and contacting public health institutions.\n\nThe number of incident Bbsl-infected individuals in the area where, and at the time when, the seroprevalence studies were conducted was estimated from the number of individuals with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies from the seroprevalence studies using the formula:, where _I_ is the number of incident Bbsl-infected individuals, _P_ is the number of individuals with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies, and _D_ is the median duration of detection of anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies. Population estimates from Eurostat (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat) were then used to estimate the incidence of Bbsl infection (incident cases per 100,000 population per year \\[PPY\\]), for the area where, and the year when, the seroprevalence studies were conducted.\n\nWe then derived estimates of the proportion of incident Bbsl-infected persons (i.e., individuals who sero-converted from anti-Bbsl IgG antibody negative to positive) who reported symptoms of LB and the persistence of anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies in a person with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies from a PubMed search of literature published from 1990‚àí2023 (Supplementary material). These estimates were then used to estimate the under-detection of cases of symptomatic Bbsl infection by surveillance (i.e., the under-detection multiplier), by comparing the incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection derived from the seroprevalence studies with the incidence of surveillance-reported LB in the area where, and time when, the seroprevalence studies were conducted. Finally, the under-detection multiplier for each country was applied to the national incidence of surveillance-reported LB in 2018‚àí2022 to derive the estimated national incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection in 2018‚Äì2022. A sensitivity analysis was conducted, using the same methodology to estimate the incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection but using the upper and lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the pooled estimate of the symptomatic proportion instead of using the pooled estimate of the symptomatic proportion.\n\nRESULTS\n-------\n\nPopulation-based seroprevalence studies of anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies were identified in nine (39%) of the 23 countries which conduct LB surveillance: the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Romania, and Switzerland. The approaches for LB surveillance varied in the nine countries: the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Switzerland had statutory reporting of all clinician-diagnosed and laboratory-diagnosed LB cases, Norway had statutory reporting of all laboratory-confirmed disseminated LB cases, and Denmark, and Ireland had statutory reporting of all laboratory-confirmed LNB cases. LB surveillance in Germany was conducted in nine federal states: Bavaria, Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia. LB surveillance in Switzerland was a voluntary sentinel surveillance network of clinicians which the public health institute extrapolates to derive nationwide estimates.\n\nOf the nine countries with seroprevalence studies and LB surveillance, three countries had two studies each resulting in twelve seroprevalence studies. In Norway and Poland, the second study was conducted in the same geographic area as the first study, so an average seroprevalence was derived from the two studies by weighting the seroprevalence of each study by the number of participants in each study. In Finland, the second study was conducted in a geographic area not included in the first study, so an overall nationwide seroprevalence was derived from the two studies by weighting by the seroprevalence in each study by the population represented in each study. The participants in the twelve seroprevalence studies were adults (age range 18‚àí80 years) except for the Czech Republic study which also included children. Seroprevalence study participants were selected from the nationwide general population in Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Ireland, the general population in subnational areas in the Czech Republic (six of the fourteen regions), Norway (five of the fifteen counties), Poland (one of the sixteen provinces), and Romania (six of the forty-one counties), and the nationwide general population in rural areas in Switzerland. The number of participants per country in the studies ranged from 95 in Poland to 6,965 in Germany, and the prevalence of individuals with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies ranged from 2.3% in Romania to 9.4% in Germany.\n\nCountry\n\nSample collection  \nlocation, year(s)\n\nNumber of participants\n\nParticipant age range  \nin years\n\nPrevalence of individuals with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies in area of seroprevalence study or studies\n\nCzech Republic\n\nCentral Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Plze≈à, South Bohemia, South Moravia, and Vysoƒçina Districts, 2001\n\n270\n\n10-59\n\n5.5%*\n\nDenmark\n\nNationwide,  \n2022\n\n1,000\n\n32-56\n\n6.2%\n\nFinland\n\nMainland Finland, 2011,  \n√Öland Islands, 1993‚Äì1997\n\n5,748‚Ä°\n\n29-80\n\n4.0%‚Ä†\n\nGermany\n\nNationwide,  \n2008‚Äì2011\n\n6,965\n\n18-80\n\n9.4%\n\nIreland\n\nNationwide, sample collection  \nyears not specified\n\n1,224\n\n¬ß\n\n3.4%\n\nNorway\n\nAgder, M√∏re og Romsdal, Rogaland, Vestland, and Vestfold og Temark counties, 2010, and 2012-2013\n\n1,713‚Ä°\n\n18-75\n\n6.8%^\n\nPoland\n\nLublin district, 1998‚Äì2007\n\n95‚Ä°\n\n33-70\n\n5.2%#\n\nLublin district, 2013\n\nRomania\n\nAlba, Bistri»õa-NƒÉsƒÉud, Cluj, Maramure»ô, SƒÉlaj, and Satu-Mare counties, 2019‚Äì2020\n\n1,200\n\n18-75\n\n2.3%\n\nSwitzerland\n\nRural regions (specific regions  \nnot specified), 2008‚Äì2009\n\n4,580\n\n¬ß\n\n6.3%*\n\nTable 1\n\nSeroprevalence of individuals with anti-_Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato (Bbsl) IgG antibodies among individuals selected from the general population in the European countries with online Lyme borreliosis surveillance data.\n\nBbsl, _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato. *Study conducted single-tier testing only; adjusted the single-tier seroprevalence from the study in the Czech Republic (10.6%) and Switzerland (12.1%) with the second-tier test results (52% seropositivity) from Finland seroprevalence study to estimate two-tier seroprevalence. ‚Ä°Combined sample size from the two seroprevalence studies. ‚Ä†Seroprevalence derived from two studies weighted by represented population in 2011 (mainland [population 5.3M] 3.9% and √Öland Islands [population 28,000] 19.5%). ^Seroprevalence derived from two studies weighted by number of participants in study ([n=1213] 5.8% and [n=519] 9.2%) studies. #Seroprevalence derived from two studies weighted by number of participants in study ([n=50] 6.0% and [n=45] 4.4%). ¬ßNot specified.\n\nThe symptomatic proportion literature search identified 4,835 articles for title and abstract review, of which 176 (3.6%) were selected for full text review (Supplementary Figure 1). From these, four (2.3%) articles met the inclusion criteria (Supplementary Table 1). One additional appropriate article was identified by co-authors, making 5 articles available for estimating the symptomatic proportion. All were cohort studies; four enrolled individuals bitten by a tick and one enrolled individuals at high risk of being bitten by a tick. All study participants were adults. The total number of participants who reported recently being bitten by a tick within the past week was 2,708; range of participants per study was 100‚àí1,546. The follow-up times after enrollment per study ranged from 42‚àí120 days. Three studies reported the frequency of subsequent tick bites during follow-up; subsequent tick bites among participants ranged from 50%‚àí72%. The studies identified a total of 110 incident Bbsl-infected individuals. The pooled estimate of the symptomatic proportion among incident Bbsl-infected individuals was 37% (95% confidence interval [CI] 28‚àí46%).\n\nThe literature search for articles on the persistence of IgG antibodies also identified 4,835 articles for title and abstract review, of which 288 (6.0%) were selected for full text review. From these, five (1.7%) articles met the inclusion criteria. Three additional appropriate articles were identified by co-authors, making eight articles available for estimating symptomatic proportion. Six were follow-up studies of individuals with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies identified when they sought medical care and two were follow-up studies of individuals with IgG antibodies identified by general population seroprevalence studies. The total number of individuals with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies in the studies was 3,352; range of individuals with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies per study was 22‚àí2,287. Five studies included adults and children, two included only adults, and one included only children. The median follow-up times after enrollment ranged from 0.8‚àí12.0 years. The range in the estimated time for 50% of the individuals with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies to sero-revert to IgG-negative was 0.4‚àí33.3 years; the range was 0.4‚àí30.0 years among the studies of medically-attended patients and 12.8‚àí33.3 years among studies of the general population. Given the range in median time for persistence of IgG antibodies in Bbsl-infected individuals in the eight studies, two scenarios were used: a 10-year persistence of anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies (scenario #1) and 20-year persistence of anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies (scenario #2).\n\nUsing the identified seroprevalence studies, LB surveillance data, a 37% symptomatic proportion, and the two scenarios of persistence of antibodies, estimates of the incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection and the under-detection multipliers were derived in the area and time-period of the seroprevalence studies. Under scenario #1, the under-detection multipliers were 2.2 in Finland, 2.4 in Switzerland, 5.7 in the Czech Republic, 5.7 in Poland, 10.4 in Germany, and 10.5 in Romania, where all LB cases are reported; 28.1 in Norway, where only disseminated LB cases are reported; and 54.6 in Denmark, and 722.2 in Ireland, where only LNB cases were reported.

Since disease incidence is a key measure for estimating disease burden, our results add to the growing evidence of the substantial LB burden in Europe. We have previously published data from Finland, Germany, and Poland using a similar methodology. However, this report provides more detailed estimates of the proportion of incident Bbsl-infected persons that report symptoms and the persistence of anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies, the key inputs needed to derive the incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection from seroprevalence studies and LB surveillance data and extends this approach to all countries in Europe with appropriate data. Using seroprevalence studies to estimate the incidence of symptomatic infection is a standard epidemiological approach and has been used for other infectious diseases, but this represents the first application to multinational LB estimates.\n\nThe aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the incidence of Bbsl infection and LB burden in Europe, where countries use a variety of approaches for public health surveillance for LB. Since surveillance systems are not intended to detect all cases of symptomatic Bbsl infection, it is expected that the estimated incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection is notably higher than the incidence of surveillance-reported LB. Under the 10-year persistence of antibodies scenario, in countries with reporting of all LB cases, the under-detection multipliers ranged from 2.4 to 10.5, indicating that there are 2.4 to 10.5 individuals with symptomatic Bbsl infection for each surveillance-reported LB case. In contrast, in countries with reporting of only LNB cases, the multipliers ranged from approximately 55 to 722. The high under-detection multiplier of symptomatic Bbsl-infected individuals by LNB only surveillance is expected since LNB is a less common manifestation of Bbsl infection; only an estimated 3% of patients with medically-attended LB have LNB. Quantifying the extent of the under-detection of symptomatic Bbsl infection by LB surveillance, including LNB surveillance, is a useful tool for understanding the LB burden.\n\nAlthough online LB surveillance data are available in many European countries, anti-Bbsl IgG seroprevalence studies with specimens collected from a representative sample of the general population were identified for only nine countries. For our analysis, we did not use seroprevalence studies of persons at increased risk for tick exposure and/or LB (i.e., studies of forest workers) because such studies yield a higher prevalence of anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies and are not appropriate for estimating the under-detection of symptomatic Bbsl infection by surveillance. Two-tier diagnostic testing protocols which utilize a screening test (with a high sensitivity) followed by a confirmatory test (with a high specificity) of specimens that are first-tier positive, is a recommended diagnostic approach in many countries. To reduce the potential for false positive results which would inflate the seroprevalence estimates thereby increasing the number of estimated incident cases and reducing the under-detection multipliers, our intention was to only use general population seroprevalence which used two-tier diagnostic testing. However, two of the seroprevalence studies that we identified used a single-tier diagnostic testing protocol to identify Bbsl-infected individuals. Therefore, in our study, we used the results from the seroprevalence study in Finland, which had the highest proportion of screening test positive specimens that were confirmatory test positive (52%), to adjust the results in the two single-tier seroprevalence studies. The results from the study in Finland were chosen to adjust the results in the single-tier seroprevalence studies as a conservative approach to optimize specificity.\n\nThere are several limitations in the available seroprevalence studies and LB surveillance data that impact the estimates of the incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection. Several of the seroprevalence studies had a small number of participants, reducing the robustness of the prevalence estimates. For example, the two seroprevalence studies in Poland only had a total of 95 participants. Also, to use the estimated under-detection multipliers to estimate the incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection in 2018‚àí2022, we assumed that the multipliers had remained unchanged since the conduct of the seroprevalence study. However, LB awareness may be increasing in some areas which could result in lower multipliers and lower estimated incidence. Furthermore, most of the participants in the seroprevalence studies were adults and most of the seroprevalence studies did not provide age-stratified prevalence estimates. Therefore, it was not possible to derive age-specific under-detection multipliers and we extrapolated the results of the seroprevalence studies to all ages. This is likely a conservative approach since the prevalence of anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies is probably higher in adults than children. Therefore, using seroprevalence estimates from adults probably over-estimated the population seroprevalence, resulting in a higher estimated incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection at the time that the seroprevalence study was conducted, which when compared to the incidence of surveillance-reported LB cases from the same time-period resulted in a lower under-detection multiplier. Finally, when the lower under-detection multiplier was applied to the most recent incidence of surveillance-reported LB cases, it will result in a lower incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection at the time of the most recent surveillance data.\n\nAnother limitation of the seroprevalence studies is that the studies in the Czech Republic, Norway, Poland, and Romania were conducted among residents of subnational areas. To derive the estimate of the national incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection, we assumed that the nationwide under-detection multipliers were the same as the multipliers derived from the seroprevalence studies and surveillance data in the subnational area. Depending on the LB incidence in the areas not included in the seroprevalence studies, the extrapolation of under-detection multipliers nationwide may result in an under-estimation or over-estimation of the national incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection. Furthermore, LB surveillance in Germany is only conducted in part of the country, therefore, our estimate of the symptomatic LB incidence is only for the states in Germany that conduct LB surveillance. In addition, the LB surveillance in Switzerland is a voluntary sentinel surveillance network of clinicians which the public health institute extrapolates for a nationwide estimate of reported LB cases. Also, the LNB surveillance data from Ireland included a small number of cases and therefore the under-detection multiplier in Ireland may be less reliable. This is reflected in the year-to-year variability in estimated incidence in Ireland; for example, the estimated incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection was 204/100,000 population in 2020 based on 14 LNB cases and 58/100,000 population in 2021 based on 4 LNB cases. The less reliable estimates in Ireland probably contribute to the notably higher multiplier in Ireland than Denmark, the other country that conducts surveillance only for LNB cases.\n\nFurther limitations of our approach to estimate the incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection are that the calculations are dependent on the estimates of the proportion of incident Bbsl-infected individuals who reported symptoms. We derived an estimate of the proportion of individuals with serological evidence of an incident Bbsl infection who reported symptoms during a 3‚àí4 month follow-up period. However, some patients with LB do not have serological evidence of infection at the time of the LB diagnosis either because they will not develop detectable IgG antibodies or it is too early in the course of illness to have a detectable antibody response. For example, some persons with EM do not develop detectable IgG antibodies. Furthermore, Bbsl-infected persons previously treated with antibiotics may no longer have detectable antibodies. Therefore, the symptomatic proportion among persons with LB, which includes individuals with and without detectable anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies, will be higher than the symptomatic proportion among Bbsl-infected persons which includes only individuals with detectable IgG antibodies. In our study, the symptomatic proportion was estimated from five studies. Including the additional participants in these studies who developed EM during follow-up but did not seroconvert, the pooled symptomatic proportion among persons with incident LB was 52%, which represents a 15% increase in the symptomatic proportion compared to the proportion (37%) we used in our analysis. Our use of a lower symptomatic proportion can be considered a conservative approach since it results in lower estimates of the incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection.\n\nTo identify studies to estimate the symptomatic proportion, we used strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The included studies had to be follow-up studies that identified incident Bbsl-infected individuals and interviewed them about symptoms. Although the five identified studies included almost three thousand participants, the studies identified a small number of individuals with an incident Bbsl infection; therefore the CI of symptomatic proportion in each study are wide. Also, all participants in the five studies were adults, therefore we assumed that the symptomatic proportion in children is the same as in adults despite the possibility that the symptomatic proportion may vary by age. Furthermore, with the limited number of identified individuals with an incident Bbsl infection, there is insufficient data to stratify the symptomatic proportion among Bbsl-infected persons by various regions in Europe. It is possible that the symptomatic proportion varies by region because the Bbsl genospecies causing infections may vary by region. Furthermore, the five studies used different approaches to identify incident Bbsl-infected individuals and interview them about symptoms. Also, the studies followed participants for only three to four months to identify symptoms. A longer follow-up period of the participants with a Bbsl infection may have identified more symptomatic infected individuals. For example, some Bbsl-infected persons do not report symptoms until they have disseminated disease, which may occur more than four months after infection. However, using a longer follow-up period to identify additional symptomatic persons is problematic because a high proportion of study participants reported subsequent tick bites. Despite these limitations, the symptomatic proportion was notably similar between the five studies. Furthermore, we used the upper and lower bond of the 95% CI of the pooled estimate of the symptomatic proportion in a sensitivity analysis. As the symptomatic proportion decreased, the estimated incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection declined.\n\nTo be included in the studies on the persistence of anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies, studies had to be follow-up studies of individuals with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies. There was a wide range (0.4‚àí33.3 years) in the median time of persistence of antibodies in the eight identified studies, which included over three thousand individuals with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies. Participants in the studies included children and adults, but it was not possible to stratify the persistence of antibodies by age despite the possibility that persistence may vary by age. Several factors may contribute to the lack of agreement between the studies. First, while the individuals with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies in five studies sought medical care and may have been treated with antibiotics, the majority of individuals with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies in two general population studies were likely asymptomatic and therefore likely did not seek medical care. Antibiotic treatment of Bbsl-infected persons can shorten the persistence of antibodies. Second, an individual with anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies could be subsequently bitten by an infected _Ixodes_ tick which would further prolong the persistence of antibodies. In the studies used to estimate of the symptomatic proportion, three studies reported that 50‚àí72% of participants were subsequently bitten by ticks during the three- to four-month follow-up period. Given the lack of agreement between the studies used to estimate the persistence of antibodies, we elected to estimate the incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection using two scenarios, a 10-year and a 20-year persistence of anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies. The incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection is reduced by 50% using a 20-year persistence compared to a 10-year persistence.\n\nResults from this study demonstrate a high incidence of symptomatic Bbsl infection in several European countries and provide estimates of the extent of under-detection of symptomatic Bbsl infection by surveillance. Furthermore, this study shows how under-detection of symptomatic Bbsl infection varies between different types of surveillance systems and that differences in surveillance need to be considered when comparing reported data across countries.\n\nEthical approval\n----------------\n\nApproval was not required.\n\nData sharing statement\n----------------------\n\nData available upon request from corresponding author.\n\nFunding\n-------\n\nThis work was supported and jointly funded by Valneva and Pfizer as part of their co-development of a Lyme Disease vaccine.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n--------------------\n\nFA and EC wrote the manuscript.

The skeletal dysplasia impairs the growth of the bone in the limbs and causes abnormal growth in the spine and skull. Though the cause is result of a genetic mutation, approximately 1 out of 5 cases is hereditary and passed by the parent.\n\nThe designation from the federal agency was received based on the phase 2 PROPEL 2 (NCT04265651) clinical trial. In the prospective, open-label study of infigratinib among children aged 3 to 11 years, the primary endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events and change from baseline in annualized height velocity.\n\nAccording to BridgeBio Pharma, infigratinib resulted in a statistically significant and sustained increase in annualized height velocity with a mean change from baseline of +2.51cm/yr at Month 12, and +2.50 cm/yr at Month 18 (P = 0.0015). Also observed was a statistically significant improvement in body proportionality at 18 months (P = 0.001).\n\n‚ÄúThe receipt of Breakthrough Therapy Designation, the first ever for a treatment being developed for children with achondroplasia, marks another important milestone for our skeletal dysplasia program," said Adora Ndu, PharmD, JD, chief, Regulatory Affairs officer, BridgeBio, in a statement. "This recognition by the FDA further confirms the strength of our Phase 2 data, and the substantial improvement on clinically significant endpoints over available therapies. We are excited by what this means for the community, and we look forward to working closely with FDA to expedite the development of infigratinib and access for families to an oral option."\n\nThe phase 3 PROPEL 3 (NCT06164951) global registrational study of infigratinib in achondroplasia is enrolling on schedule, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2024. Infigratinib has also received Orphan Drug Designation, Fast Track Designation, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA.\n\n"The reality is that achondroplasia is a skeletal dysplasia which could impact aspects of health-related quality of life and functionality," said Munira Shamim, the founder of Growing Stronger, a US advocacy group the care of individuals with achondroplasia. "This action represents a significant step towards offering the first oral treatment option more readily for families living with achondroplasia. Having a wider range of therapies empowers families with greater control and choice over their healthcare decisions."\n\n**References**:\n\n1.

With the amazing advancement that we have experienced in oncology care and patient survivorship, there is also a risk that these patients can develop cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction,‚Äù **Sarju Ganatra, MD, FACC**, medical director of sustainability and director of the cardio-oncology program at Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, Beth Israel Lahey Health in Burlington, Massachusetts, told Healio. ‚ÄúThe clinical implications of this entity can be substantial, including premature termination of cancer therapy and, hence, increased risk of disease-related morbidity and mortality. Interest has henceforth mounted to effectively target cancer cells while minimizing adverse effects on the CV system. While various agents have been tested, to date, no other treatment has been demonstrated to be very effective and safe in preventing cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction.‚Äù\n\nUsing the TriNetX database, Ganatra and colleagues conducted a retrospective analysis of 8,675 adult patients with diabetes and cancer treated with cardiotoxic therapies and no history of cardiomyopathy or HF (mean age, 65 years; 42% women; 71% white). Patients were stratified by SGLT2 inhibitor use and outcomes were compared during a 12-month follow-up period.\n\nThe most common malignancy in this cohort was breast cancer (26.3%), followed by lymphomas (20.8%), gastrointestinal cancer (18.9%), metastatic malignancy (16.4%) and multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes (12.8%).\n\nThe most common anticancer therapy used was anthracyclines (24.5%), followed by monoclonal antibodies (21.2%), antimetabolites (19%), small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (16.9%), proteasome inhibitors (8.3%), alkylating agents (7.2%) and aromatase inhibitors (3%).\n\nAfter propensity-score matching patients taking an SGLT2 inhibitor with those not taking one, the researchers reported that those prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor had lower risk for cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (HR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69-0.84), HF exacerbations (HR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72-0.9), all-cause mortality (HR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.61-0.74) and all-cause hospitalizations and ED visits (HR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89-0.97) compared with patients not on SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\nAdditionally, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in this patient population were consistent across all cancer therapies included in the analysis.\n\n‚ÄúSome preclinical and smaller limited clinical studies where patients are getting one type of chemotherapy have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors can be effective in preventing cardiotoxicity,‚Äù Ganatra told Healio. ‚ÄúHowever, we are incredibly pleased to demonstrate that it works in preventing cardiotoxicity among patients receiving a wide range of potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapies. This has been demonstrated for the first time and we believe it sets the stage for further prospective studies to help this vulnerable patient population and possibly offers them a preventive strategy.‚Äù\n\nAmong SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin (Jardiance, Boehringer Ingelheim/Eli Lilly) was associated with a greater treatment effect for reducing risk for cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (HR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.7-0.87; _P_ < .001) compared with dapagliflozin (Farxiga, AstraZeneca; HR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-1.11; _P_ = .45) and canagliflozin (Invokana, Janssen; HR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77-1.11; _P_ = .41), according to the study.\n\n‚ÄúThis finding in our study could be a result of small sample size. However, Zhang et al also showed in their meta-analysis from 2022 that empagliflozin compared to three other SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with greater improvements in cardiac remodeling parameters. Dabour et al had commented recently on empagliflozin‚Äôs ability to improve cardiac energy metabolism, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects, as well as antifibrotic effects,‚Äù Ganatra told Healio. ‚ÄúNonetheless, more studies are needed to further elucidate empagliflozin‚Äôs mechanism of action in this specific patient population compared to other SGLT2 inhibitors, as well as SGLT2 inhibitors as a class of cardioprotective medications for patients with cancer and cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction.\n\n‚ÄúWhile some preclinical and smaller clinical studies have shown effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in cancer treatment itself, our large real-world study further solidifies the potential anticancer beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with diabetes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMost importantly, this study further illustrates the link of metabolic disease such as diabetes with both cancer and cardiovascular disease. This highlights the need of cardio-onco-metabolics field and studies and agents that examine the effect on the entire axis.‚Äù\n\nFor more information:\n\n**Sarju Ganatra, MD, FACC**, can be reached at sarju.ganatra@lahey.org.\n\nReferences:\n\n*   [Bhatti AW, et al. _JACC_ _CardioOncol_. 2024;doi:10.1016/j.jaccao.2024.08.001.](https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jaccao.2024.08.001)\n*   [Dabour MS, et al. _J__ACC_ _CardioOnc_. 2024;doi:10.1016/j.jaccao.2024.01.007.](https://www.jacc.org/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jaccao.2024.01.007)\n*   [Zhang N, et al. _Eur J Prev Cardiol_. 2022;doi:10.1093/eurjpc/zwab173.](https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/28/17/1961/6430917)\n\nPublished by: \n\nSources/Disclosures\n\n**Source:**\n\nBhatti AW, et al.

Similarly, minimum pitch in the morning was significantly higher at exacerbation peak vs. baseline (106.59 Hz vs. 73.84 Hz; P < .01) and the number of voice breaks was significantly lower (4.6 vs. 11.75; P < .05).\n\nIn the evening recordings, the speech feature that significantly differed between baseline and the exacerbation time points was jitter (breathy or hoarse sounding voice). Local absolute jitter was significantly higher at exacerbation onset and peak vs. baseline (118.39 ¬µs and 104.23 ¬µs vs. 100.07 ¬µs; P < .05). Additionally, jitter measured as five-point period perturbation quotient was significantly elevated at onset of an exacerbation vs. baseline (0.94% vs. 0.62%; P < .05) and at peak of an exacerbation vs. baseline (0.84% vs. 0.62%; P < .05).\n\n‚ÄúEven though we hoped for it, we were surprised to see that the speech characteristics already change significantly the first day of the exacerbation,‚Äù van Bemmel told Healio. ‚ÄúWe expected the speech to be different during the peak of symptoms, but finding significant difference on the onset day is very nice.\n\n‚ÄúIn future studies we will validate our findings with more data and design algorithms to predict exacerbations by speech as well,‚Äù van Bemmel said. ‚ÄúFurthermore, we will design an app specifically for people with COPD to also employ the algorithm.‚Äù\n\nReferences:\n\n* Praat intro.

Hopefully our findings help lessen the burden on everyday clinicians in the future, and for now convince people of the importance and potential use of speech analysis.‚Äù\n\nUsing the TACTICAS smartphone app, van Bemmel and colleagues assessed speech recordings of 28 patients with COPD taken three times a day for 12 weeks to examine differences in speech at onset and peak of symptoms of a COPD exacerbation vs. speech at baseline.\n\nPatients filled out the EXACT questionnaire once a day, so researchers knew when they experienced an exacerbation (score ‚â• 9 points above baseline for 3 days or ‚â• 12 points above baseline for 2 days).\n\nAccording to a press release from the European Respiratory Society, recordings captured patients ‚Äúsaying ‚Äòahh‚Äô for as long as they could manage with one breath, then either reading a short paragraph of a story or answering a question.‚Äù\n\nThe Praat computer program allowed researchers to extract 25 speech features, such as pitch, voice breaks and jitter from sustained vowel /a/ in patients‚Äô morning and evening recordings.\n\nBy the 4-week mark, 11 patients (mean age, 68.6 years; 36.4% women) had at least one exacerbation, and by the 8-week mark, the study cohort reported 16 COPD exacerbations.\n\nIn the morning recordings, researchers observed a significant difference between baseline and exacerbation onset in terms of minimum pitch (73.84 Hz vs. 101.48 Hz; P < .05) and number of voice breaks (11.75 vs. 5.38; P < .05). Similarly, minimum pitch in the morning was significantly higher at exacerbation peak vs. baseline (106.59 Hz vs. 73.84 Hz; P < .01) and the number of voice breaks was significantly lower (4.6 vs. 11.75; P < .05).\n\nIn the evening recordings, the speech feature that significantly differed between baseline and the exacerbation time points was jitter (breathy or hoarse sounding voice). Local absolute jitter was significantly higher at exacerbation onset and peak vs. baseline (118.39 ¬µs and 104.23 ¬µs vs. 100.07 ¬µs; P < .05). Additionally, jitter measured as five-point period perturbation quotient was significantly elevated at onset of an exacerbation vs. baseline (0.94% vs. 0.62%; P < .05) and at peak of an exacerbation vs. baseline (0.84% vs. 0.62%; P < .05).\n\n‚ÄúEven though we hoped for it, we were surprised to see that the speech characteristics already change significantly the first day of the exacerbation,‚Äù van Bemmel told Healio. ‚ÄúWe expected the speech to be different during the peak of symptoms, but finding significant difference on the onset day is very nice.\n\n‚ÄúIn future studies we will validate our findings with more data and design algorithms to predict exacerbations by speech as well,‚Äù van Bemmel said. ‚ÄúFurthermore, we will design an app specifically for people with COPD to also employ the algorithm.‚Äù\n\nReferences:\n-----------\n\n*   Praat intro.

In both trials‚Äîone involving people with lung cancer and the other with lymphoma‚Äîadding a JAK inhibitor to an immune checkpoint inhibitor shrank tumors in more than half of the participants.\n\nTypically, immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are standard treatments for dozens of cancer types, only work for 15% to 60% of people who take them. But when these treatments do work, they can have astonishing effects, melting metastatic tumors and keeping them away for years.\n\nOver the past decade, scientists have been searching up and down for ways to make these drugs work for more patients. In the new studies, researchers explored a possible role for JAK inhibitors, which dampen chronic inflammation and are used to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.\n\nThe results are impressive for a few reasons, experts said. In the lung cancer trial, the combination shrank the tumors of substantially more participants than is typically seen with an immune checkpoint inhibitor alone. And in the lymphoma trial, all the participants had already been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor that had stopped working. Both studies were published June 21 in Science.\n\nThe studies also uncovered why JAK inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors appear to work well together. Immune checkpoint inhibitors unleash the activity of cancer-killing immune cells called T cells. And JAK inhibitors, the studies showed, reinvigorate burnt-out T cells‚Äîsetting the stage for immune checkpoint inhibitors to turbocharge them against tumors.\n\nThose findings highlight an important trend, according to Gr√©goire Altan-Bonnet, Ph.D., of NCI‚Äôs Laboratory of Integrative Cancer Immunology. ‚ÄúWe are becoming more sophisticated in the ways we manipulate the immune response to cancer,‚Äù said Dr. Altan-Bonnet, who wasn‚Äôt involved in either study.\n\nThe two trials involved people with different types of cancer, treated with different JAK inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, and with different timing of each drug‚Äôs administration, pointed out Andy Minn, M.D., Ph.D., one of the leaders of the lung cancer study.\n\n‚ÄúAnd yet we both reached the same conclusion, which to me is just really remarkable and provides a lot of motivation and hope that we're on to something,‚Äù said Dr. Minn, of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and director of the Mark Foundation Center for Immunotherapy, Immune Signaling, and Radiation.\n\nBut there‚Äôs still a lot to learn about this combination approach, said the lymphoma study‚Äôs leader, John Teijaro, Ph.D., of Scripps Research Institute in California. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still a long way to go in understanding how this works, what the best course is for patients, what the best JAK inhibitor is, when you should give it, and what dose you should give. They‚Äôre all open questions that need to be investigated,‚Äù he said.\n\nJAK proteins‚Äîthe targets of JAK inhibitors‚Äîare like puppet masters, pulling the strings that control numerous cellular functions, including inflammation and immune cell activity. And once immune checkpoint inhibitors came onto the scene, scientists quickly gathered loads of evidence that JAK proteins are also critical for these drugs to work.\n\nSo until now, the thought was that blocking JAK proteins with JAK inhibitors would only make immune checkpoint inhibitors less effective.\n\nBut Dr. Minn and Dr. Teijaro were finding the exact opposite could also be true. Dr. Minn‚Äôs group noticed that tumors in mice that grew back after immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment had high activity of JAK-regulated genes. And Dr. Teijaro‚Äôs team found that JAK inhibitors revived cancer-killing T cells.\n\n‚ÄúWe had a lot of data that was pointing in this paradoxical direction,‚Äù Dr. Minn said. The researchers landed on a new idea: What if timing matters when it comes to JAK proteins and immune checkpoint inhibitors?\n\n‚ÄúAnd it turned out, we think that's the case,‚Äù Dr. Minn said.\n\nThey suspect that an initial, short burst of JAK-led inflammation activates T cells, setting the stage for immune checkpoint inhibitors to unleash the T cells against tumors. But if JAK proteins keep signaling on an endless loop, chronic inflammation sets in and cancer-killing T cells get burnt out‚Äîoften called T cell exhaustion. And treating chronically inflamed tumors with immune checkpoint inhibitors is like pushing the ‚Äúon‚Äù button of a toy with dead batteries.\n\nSo, both groups set out to see if JAK inhibitors could cool the flames of chronic inflammation while preserving that first spark needed for immune checkpoint inhibitors to work.\n\nBoth sets of researchers started by testing the combination strategy in mice implanted with various kinds of cancer. Combining a JAK inhibitor with an immune checkpoint inhibitor slowed tumor growth substantially more than either drug alone, both teams found.\n\nBuoyed by their findings, Dr. Minn and his colleagues launched a clinical trial involving 21 people with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. All patients received the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda) plus the JAK inhibitor itacitinib.\n\nThe treatment partially or completely shrank the tumors of 14 of the 21 participants (67%). And it kept their tumors at bay for a median of more than 2 years. In other clinical trials, by contrast, tumors have been found to shrink in less than half of people with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who get pembrolizumab as an initial treatment. And among those whose tumors do shrink, the treatment typically stops tumor growth for only a few months.\n\nDr. Teijaro and his colleagues connected with researchers at the University of Minnesota who were testing the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib (Jakafi) and the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) in a clinical trial of 19 people with Hodgkin lymphoma. All participants had previously received an immune checkpoint inhibitor that hadn‚Äôt worked for them or had worked only marginally.\n\nWhen immune checkpoint inhibitors fail for people with Hodgkin lymphoma, there are few treatment options left, Dr. Teijaro pointed out. ‚ÄúTheir cancer is resistant to most drugs by that time. This is a really tough patient population to treat,‚Äù he said.\n\nBut when nivolumab was reintroduced with ruxolitinib, tumors shrank in 10 people (53%), including six patients whose tumors disappeared completely. Two years after the start of the trial, 46% of participants had no sign of their cancer growing back (disease progression). In contrast, 2-year progression-free survival was 23% in a small clinical trial of people with lymphoma who received nivolumab and another drug after nivolumab alone stopped working.\n\nSide effects were infrequent in the two trials, and none of the patients in the lymphoma trial had to stop the treatment due to side effects, said another member of the Scripps team, Jaroslav Zak, Ph.D.\n\n‚ÄúEven anemia, which is quite common with ruxolitinib‚Äîmost of these patients didn‚Äôt get anemia or any blood cell‚Äìrelated side effects that were sufficiently severe that they had to go off the therapy,‚Äù he added.\n\nWhen the researchers dug deeper, both groups saw that the combination treatment substantially altered the numbers and activities of various immune cells in both patients and mice.\n\nAs hoped, they saw that the treatments raised numbers of invigorated T cells for many patients. But additional data suggested that there‚Äôs a limit to what JAK inhibitors can do if a patient‚Äôs T cells are completely exhausted, noted Dr. Altan-Bonnet, which may be why the combination didn‚Äôt work for everyone.\n\nJAK inhibitors also appear to do more than help exhausted T cells, Dr. Zak said. In the lymphoma trial, the treatment produced ‚Äúan even more dramatic change in myeloid cells,‚Äù especially in people whose tumors completely disappeared, he said.\n\nMyeloid cells are immune cells that can either restrain T cells or help them grow. The JAK inhibitor tipped the scales, pushing myeloid cells to be more helpful than harmful, he explained.\n\nThese results raise ‚Äúhopes for myeloid cell modulation in the context of cancer therapy,‚Äù Dr. Zak said. ‚ÄúWe have done really well with modulating T cells with checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T-cell therapy, and adoptive T-cell therapy. But I think we are far behind with myeloid cell modulation, and yet we know how important those cells are‚Äù to the success of immunotherapy, he said.\n\nThese findings about specific immune cells could eventually help researchers learn more about the best dose and timing of immunotherapies, wrote Massimo Gadina, Ph.D., and John O‚ÄôShea, M.D., of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, in a commentary on the studies.", 'gpt-4o-mini']

A recent NIH-supported study reveals that vigorous exercise does not increase the risk of adverse cardiac events compared to moderate or no exercise. Here are the key takeaways:\n\n- The study involved 1,413 participants aged 8-60, all treated for LQTS, monitored over three years.\n- Only 2.6% of vigorous exercisers experienced LQTS-triggered cardiac events, similar to the 2.7% in those who exercised moderately or not at all.\n- This research helps address longstanding concerns and may lead to fewer exercise restrictions for patients with this genetic condition.\n\nAs healthcare professionals, how can we better support our patients with LQTS in maintaining an active lifestyle?', ['Research & Clinical Trials', 'Cardiology', 'ExerciseScience', 'LongQT', 'PatientCare'], 'https://fal.media/files/panda/IhSZrpsLh4iY8Tjt8MEZ6.png', 'https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/vigorous-exercise-not-linked-increased-risk-adverse-cardiac-events-long-qt-syndrome', 'You are a content strategist specializing in crafting engaging and informative social media posts for healthcare professionals based on detailed medical articles or web content. Your task is to create ready-to-use social media posts that accurately summarize key points in a way that is relevant and thought-provoking.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n - Engaging Openers: Start with a creative hook that grabs attention‚Äîuse clinical scenarios, surprising statistics, or thought-provoking questions (without relying on overused phrases like ‚ÄúDid you know?‚Äù).\n - Informative Content: Provide a concise yet comprehensive summary of the most important information, ensuring clarity and relevance to healthcare professionals.\n - Balanced Tone: Maintain a professional yet approachable tone. Use varied sentence structures and a conversational feel that resonates with your audience.\n - Highlight Key Findings: Use bullet points to present important statistics or findings, making the information easy to read and digest.\n - Foster Engagement: Conclude with a thoughtful question or statement that encourages reflection or invites interaction, ensuring it feels natural and appropriate.\n - Emojis Usage: Use emojis sparingly and strategically to emphasize key points or statistics, while maintaining professionalism.\n - Formatting: Deliver the final post as plain text, formatted for easy reading without the need for Markdown or HTML.\n\nKey Focus:\n\n - Clarity and Comprehensiveness: Ensure the post covers essential details to inform healthcare professionals effectively.\n - Readability: Use bullet points and varied sentence lengths to enhance readability.\n\nAn Example Post:\n\n‚è±Ô∏è A weekly insulin dose that matches daily treatments in

increased risk of adverse cardiac events in long QT syndrome\n============================================================================================\n\nNIH-supported study could lessen exercise restrictions for those with genetic heart condition.\n\n### What\n\nPeople who exercise vigorously and have long QT syndrome (LQTS), an inherited disorder of the heart‚Äôs electrical system that leads to chaotic heartbeats, do not have a higher risk of adverse cardiac events compared to those who exercise moderately or not at all, a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported study has found. The study, published in _Circulation_, helps answer a longstanding question about whether vigorous exercise increases the risk for life-threatening abnormal heartbeats, called ventricular arrhythmias, in individuals being treated for LQTS. The new data also help fill an evidence gap that often has led to recommended restrictions from exercise for those with the inherited disease.\n\nThe observational study, funded by NIH‚Äôs National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), enrolled 1,413 individuals with LQTS at 37 medical sites in five countries from May 2015 to February 2019. The study participants were aged 8-60 and either carried the gene that causes LQTS or were diagnosed based on an abnormal EKG reading. Importantly, at the time of the study, all participants were being treated for their condition with medication or surgically fixed devices such as an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), which can detect arrhythmias. Fifty-two percent of the study participants were already vigorous exercisers, such as runners, while the other 48% either participated in moderate exercise, such as walking or yard work, or did not exercise.\n\nThe researchers then followed the groups for three years and looked at the occurrence of four main cardiovascular events during that period: sudden deaths, resuscitated sudden cardiac arrests, arrythmias that were treated by an ICD, and the most dangerous type of fainting caused by arrythmias, known as arrhythmic syncope.\n\nBased on a unique study design called non-inferiority, which asks if one treatment is equal to another ‚Äì in this case is vigorous exercise equal to moderate exercise ‚Äì the results were not statistically significant. The researchers found that in individuals with LQTS who exercised vigorously, the overall rate of adverse cardiac events was low, with 2.6% experiencing a likely LQTS-triggered cardiac event during the three-year follow up period. Notably, the outcome was similar for those exercising moderately or not at all, with 2.7% having a cardiac event.\n\n### Study\n\nLampert R, Day S, Ackerman MJ, et al.

In the trial, researchers from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) genetically engineered normal white blood cells, known as lymphocytes, from each patient to produce receptors that recognize and attack their specific cancer cells. These initial findings are from people with metastatic colorectal cancer who had already undergone multiple earlier treatments. The personalized immunotherapy shrank tumors in some patients and was able to keep the tumors from regrowing for up to seven months. The findings were published July 11, 2024, in Nature Medicine.\n\nOne form of cellular immunotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, has already been shown to be effective against some blood cancers, and another, called tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, has proven to be effective against metastatic melanoma. However, to date, a cellular therapy that‚Äôs effective against any other solid cancers has been elusive, according to Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., of NCI‚Äôs Center for Cancer Research (CCR), who co-led the study with Maria Parkhurst, Ph.D., of CCR‚Äôs Surgery Branch.\n\n‚ÄúThe fact that we can take a growing metastatic solid cancer and get it to regress shows that the new cellular immunotherapy approach has promise,‚Äù Dr. Rosenberg said. ‚ÄúHowever, it‚Äôs important to understand that these findings are preliminary and that the approach needs to be further refined and tested in more types of solid cancers.‚Äù\n\nThe new approach overcomes two challenges in cellular immunotherapy: how to produce large numbers of T cells that can recognize cancer cells specifically, and how to boost the ability of modified T cells to multiply once they‚Äôve been returned to the patient.\n\nFor each patient in the study, Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues collected lymphocytes present in the patient‚Äôs tumors. They then used sophisticated molecular characterization techniques to identify and isolate receptors on those lymphocytes, called T-cell receptors, that recognized specific changes in each patient‚Äôs tumor. After genetically sequencing those receptors, they then used a retrovirus to insert the genes for the receptor into normal lymphocytes collected from each patient‚Äôs circulating blood.\n\nThe genetically modified lymphocytes were then multiplied into the hundreds of millions in the laboratory and infused back into the patients, where they expressed the tumor-specific T-cell receptors and continued to multiply.\n\n‚ÄúBy taking the natural T-cell receptors that are present in a very small number of cells and putting them into normal lymphocytes for which we have enormous numbers‚Äîa million in every thimbleful of blood‚Äîwe can generate as many cancer-fighting cells as we want,‚Äù Dr. Rosenberg explained.\n\nAs part of a larger phase 2 trial, seven patients with metastatic colon cancer were treated with the experimental personalized cellular immunotherapy. All seven received several doses of the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) before the cell therapy and another immunotherapy drug called IL-2 afterward. Three patients had substantial shrinkage of metastatic tumors in the liver, lung, and lymph nodes that lasted for four to seven months. The median time to disease progression was 4.6 months.\n\nDr. Rosenberg noted that, of the three patients who responded to the treatment, two had received T-cell receptors derived from cytotoxic T cells, which are primarily responsible for killing diseased cells. Dr. Rosenberg said his research team is exploring how to put the T cell receptors into subtypes of normal lymphocytes to improve their reactivity.\n\nColon cancer is just one of many solid tumors the researchers are studying. The trial is still ongoing and includes patients with different types of solid cancers.\n\n‚ÄúIt's just the very beginning of converting normal lymphocytes into cells capable of treating the common solid cancers,‚Äù Dr. Rosenberg said. ‚ÄúWhat this study shows is that it's possible. Once you know it‚Äôs possible, you work to improve it.‚Äù\n\nAbout the National Cancer Institute (NCI): NCI leads the National Cancer Program and NIH‚Äôs efforts to dramatically reduce the prevalence of cancer and improve the lives of people with cancer.

Dr. Hoeppner presented the findings at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago on June 2.\n\n‚ÄúThe results have been long awaited among those of us who treat esophageal cancer,‚Äù said Karyn A. Goodman, M.D., of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, who discussed the results during the meeting but was not involved in the study.\n\nDr. Goodman also noted, however, that the treatment landscape for esophageal cancer is rapidly evolving. Although it‚Äôs important to have some resolution to this particular debate, she said, newer treatments, including immunotherapies, are also now an option for people with locally advanced esophageal cancer.\n\nIn addition, researchers are also testing whether combining these regimens with other therapies can lead to even better outcomes for patients. In other words, she stressed, how locally advanced esophageal cancer is treated is going to continue to evolve in the coming years.\n\nTwo standard of care treatment options\n\nIn the United States, it is estimated that more than 22,000 people will be diagnosed with esophageal cancer this year. Approximately half of these cases will be diagnosed at a locally advanced stage.\n\nSurgery was long the primary treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer. That changed over the past two decades, with several large trials showing that the addition of perioperative chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiation therapy improved how long people lived.\n\nFrom those trials, two options emerged as the recommended treatments: a perioperative chemotherapy regimen called FLOT and a neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation regimen called CROSS (see box).\n\nWith two proven, highly effective treatment approaches available, Dr. Hoeppner and his colleagues decided to launch a trial to answer a question that arose frequently among oncologists: Which one is best for their patients?\n\nOne regimen rises above the other\n\nIn the new trial, dubbed ESOPEC and funded by the German Research Foundation, 438 people with locally advanced esophageal cancer were randomly assigned to receive either perioperative chemotherapy with the FLOT regimen or neoadjuvant chemoradiation with the CROSS regimen.\n\nAfter completing treatment, 35 of the 191 patients in the FLOT group had complete disappearance of their tumor, known as a complete response, compared with 24 of the 180 patients in the CROSS group.\n\nPatients who received the FLOT regimen lived a median of 5 years and 6 months, compared with about 3 years for patients in the CROSS group. Three years after completion of treatment, 57% of people in the FLOT group and 51% of patients in the CROSS group were still alive.\n\nThe rate of complications after surgery was similar among both groups. However, within 90 days of surgery, about 3% of participants in the FLOT group had died, compared with nearly 6% of participants in the CROSS group.\n\nConsidering the role of immunotherapy\n\nThe FLOT regimen should now be the standard of care for most people with locally advanced esophageal cancer, Dr. Goodman agreed.\n\nBut with the rise of immunotherapies, that may change.\n\nFor example, a trial called CheckMate 577 showed that giving the immunotherapy drug nivolumab (Opdivo) after the CROSS regimen and surgery may be an effective option.\n\nIn that trial, which included people considered to be at high risk of their cancer coming back, giving nivolumab after surgery improved how long participants lived without their disease returning.\n\nSo particularly in combination with nivolumab, CROSS may have some advantages for certain patients, Dr. Goodman pointed out.\n\nFor example, people with esophageal cancer tend to be elderly and have other health problems, she explained. ‚ÄúThe CROSS regimen is ‚Ä¶ very well tolerated by these patients. And I think ‚Ä¶ the CROSS regimen, followed by adjuvant nivolumab, is still a potential option for many of these patients,‚Äù Dr. Goodman said.\n\nOther studies are also testing the addition of immunotherapies, including other immune checkpoint inhibitors, into existing treatment regimens for locally advanced esophageal cancer. And still other studies are evaluating the combination of FLOT and CROSS.\n\n‚ÄúGiven the poor prognosis with this disease, we need to continue to develop clinical trials involving novel treatment combinations and select patients who will respond best to specific treatments,‚Äù Dr. Goodman said.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

Among them are findings from a very small trial testing a cancer treatment vaccine developed by researchers at the University of Florida.\n\nLike two of the approved COVID vaccines and some other experimental cancer vaccines, this one uses genetic material called mRNA that is loaded into fat-coated nanoparticles. But it also has a unique design aspect compared with these other vaccines: the nanoparticles have layers of fat inside, making it possible to layer each one with large numbers of mRNA.\n\nIn a study published May 1 in Cell, the researchers reported that the vaccine was effective in pet dogs with naturally occurring brain cancers, allowing them to live much longer than would typically be expected.\n\nThey also reported some initial findings from a clinical trial involving four people with glioblastoma. Because it was the vaccine‚Äôs first time being used in humans, the trial‚Äôs primary goal was to ensure that the treatment was feasible and, secondarily, to look for evidence that it helps the immune system recognize and potentially attack tumors.\n\nThe trial largely succeeded on both fronts. The vaccine appeared to kick-start a robust immune response in all four participants, with rapid and dramatic changes in the levels and activity of immune system components needed to eliminate tumors.\n\nNot unexpectedly, all four participants also had side effects from the treatment, explained the study‚Äôs lead investigator, Elias Sayour, M.D., Ph.D., a pediatric oncologist at the University of Florida and a member of the university‚Äôs McKnight Brain Institute. But although some side effects were serious, in all cases they could be successfully managed, Dr. Sayour said.\n\nSeveral immunotherapy experts stressed that there‚Äôs still a long way to go before it‚Äôs known whether the vaccine is in fact safe and, as importantly, can help people live longer.\n\nDr. Sayour agreed. Although these initial findings are encouraging, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve only treated four patients with a few [vaccine] doses,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúThere are still a lot of unknowns to work through.‚Äù\n\nThey hope to address many of these questions in additional small clinical trials of the vaccine already in the works, he said, including one in children with brain cancers.\n\nAlerting the immune system that something dangerous is happening\n\nOne of the most lethal types of brain cancer, glioblastoma is largely resistant to nearly all treatments researchers have thrown at it, including targeted therapies and, more recently, immunotherapies.\n\nWhile interest in mRNA vaccines has skyrocketed in the wake of the COVID pandemic, studies of mRNA cancer treatment vaccines have been underway for more than a decade. When it came to developing an mRNA vaccine to test against glioblastoma, Dr. Sayour and his team felt that the standard approach wasn‚Äôt going to cut it.\n\n‚ÄúWe felt like we needed [to try] new approaches that really shock the [immune] system,‚Äù he said.\n\nAlthough the mRNA vaccines for COVID are remarkably effective, there‚Äôs a big gulf between launching an immune response against a virus trying to gain a foothold in the body and against large, established tumors tucked deep in the brain.\n\nUnlike a virus in the early stages of infecting healthy cells, for example, these tumors have many ways to block the immune system from doing its job, explained Lesley Chaboub, Ph.D., a member of the Weissman lab at the University of Pennsylvania that focuses on developing mRNA vaccines.\n\nTo begin with, these tumors have surrounding environments full of molecular booby traps, blocking immune cells from reaching them or disarming them, Dr. Chaboub explained. And the cells that make up the tumors tend to be very different from one another and have few shared weaknesses to be exploited.\n\nThese and other factors have made it extremely difficult ‚Äúto find the right way to push the immune system to target‚Äù these tumors, she said.\n\nDr. Sayour and his team approached the development of their mRNA vaccine with these challenges in mind.\n\nThat required some reconfiguring of the nanoparticles themselves. The nanoparticles used in most mRNA vaccines have a spherical core and, as a result, can only hold a small amount of mRNA. For their vaccine, Dr. Sayour and his team created a nanoparticle that‚Äîlike the buttery sheets of a flaky French pastry‚Äîhas layers of fat throughout it.\n\nThey could then sandwich many mRNA molecules into each layer, producing a nanoparticle with far more of these protein blueprints than those used in other mRNA vaccines, meaning it can produce far more abnormal proteins that draw the immune system‚Äôs attention.\n\nThey also designed the nanoparticles so they would clump together into structures that the research team called lipid particle aggregates. This was another feature intended to communicate to the immune system that something is amiss.\n\nAnd, as has been done by some other research groups, they used mRNA taken from patients‚Äô tumors as part of the vaccine ‚Äúpayload.‚Äù The idea behind the strategy is that those mRNA molecules represent many of the potential abnormal proteins, or antigens, produced by the tumor.\n\nTaken as a whole, Dr. Sayour explained, the idea was to make this vaccine and its contents ‚Äúlook much more dangerous to the immune system‚Äù than has been attempted with other vaccines.\n\nPromising findings in mice, dogs, and humans\n\nThe findings reported in Cell also covered experiments testing a form of the vaccine in mouse models of different cancers. In mice with a uniformly deadly brain cancer called diffuse midline glioma that largely occurs in children, for example, the vaccine produced strong and rapid immune responses, shrinking tumors and allowing mice to live for long periods.\n\nFor the canine trial, all the dogs had naturally occurring brain cancers. Dogs are ideal models in this case because, like humans, they spontaneously develop brain cancers. In addition, Dr. Chaboub explained, their tumors often have the same characteristics that make glioblastoma so difficult to treat in humans.\n\nWithin a few days of the dogs receiving the first vaccine dose‚Äîgiven intravenously, rather than into muscle‚Äîtheir tumors had undergone an immunological ‚Äúreprogramming,‚Äù the researchers reported. Specifically, before vaccination, their tumors were ‚Äúcold,‚Äù meaning there was little evidence of any immune system activity. But afterward, it was as if an arsonist had sparked a blaze: the tumors were now ‚Äúhot‚Äù with bustling immune cells.\n\nMore importantly, the dogs lived much longer‚Äînearly four times as long‚Äîas what is historically seen in dogs with brain cancer, they reported.\n\nIn the human trial, all four patients had glioblastoma tumors that could be surgically removed. After surgery, they were given standard treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. They then received up to four doses of the vaccine intravenously over the course of 6 weeks.\n\nSimilar to what occurred in the treated dogs, the researchers again saw multiple indicators of rapid and strong immune responses in the patients‚Äô blood samples. Those indicators included spikes in levels of proteins involved in orchestrating the immune system‚Äôs response to a threat and in the levels of specific T cells involved in killing tumors cells.\n\nTrial in children with brain tumors planned\n\nThe findings with this mRNA vaccine thus far are interesting, said James Gulley, M.D., Ph.D., co-director of NCI‚Äôs Center for Immuno-Oncology.\n\nIn particular, Dr. Gulley cited the results seen in the dogs treated with the vaccine, which suggest that the vaccine appears to have activity against brain tumors. But ‚Äúit‚Äôs still very early,‚Äù he continued, and further studies are needed to definitively show that it‚Äôs safe and effective.\n\nDr. Sayour said his team is moving forward quickly but smartly. The upcoming trials of the vaccine, one involving adults and children and a second that would only include children, will be small (20 to 25 patients each) and still assess safety as their primary aim.\n\nBoth trials are being planned in conjunction with the international Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium, which includes children‚Äôs hospitals throughout the United States.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

The mid-stage studies will assess the safety, acceptability, and pharmacokinetics (how a drug moves through the body) of lenacapavir, an antiretroviral drug administered by injection every six months. The studies are sponsored and funded by Gilead Sciences, Inc., and implemented through the HIV Prevention Trails Network (HPTN). The HPTN is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health‚Äôs (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), with scientific collaboration on this study and others from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) as well as co-funding from NIDA and other NIH institutes.\n\nLenacapavir is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for HIV treatment, in combination with other antiretroviral therapy, of heavily treatment-experienced individuals, whose HIV infections cannot be successfully treated with other available treatments due to resistance, intolerance, or safety considerations with other drugs and developed multidrug resistance. Lenacapavir is the first of a class of drugs called capsid inhibitors to be FDA-approved for treating HIV infection. It is the first long-acting injectable to be offered with administration just once every six months. Cisgender women‚Äîpeople who self-identify as female and were assigned female sex at birth‚Äîand people who inject drugs accounted for 18% and 7% of new HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2021, respectively. Both population groups have been underrepresented in HIV clinical studies, as have transgender people, pregnant people and U.S. communities of color. Both trials complement ongoing large efficacy studies and are intended to provide insights on how these two priority populations experience lenacapavir-based HIV PrEP.\n\nThe studies will take place at HPTN sites in the United States and enroll people who might benefit from taking PrEP. The first trial will enroll cisgender women, with a focus on making enrollment accessible to women who self-identify as Black and/or Latina. The second trial will enroll a diverse group of people who inject drugs. In both studies, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either injectable lenacapavir or an FDA-approved PrEP formulation consisting of oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine.

Based on updated results from a large clinical trial, the drug is now part of an important milestone in the treatment of kidney cancer‚Äîspecifically, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, the most common form of the disease.\n\nAll participants in the trial had earlier-stage kidney cancer and their tumors could be removed with surgery, but they were also at increased risk of their cancer coming back, or recurring. So after undergoing surgery, they were randomly assigned to get pembrolizumab for up to a year or a placebo and routine monitoring.\n\nAt 4 years after starting the post-surgical treatment, about 91% of people given pembrolizumab were still alive, compared with 86% of those who received a placebo, according to results published April 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Overall, people who received pembrolizumab had a nearly 40% reduced risk of dying during that period.\n\nThe findings mark the first time a post-surgical, or adjuvant, treatment for kidney cancer has been shown to help people live longer.\n\nBased on earlier results from this trial, called KEYNOTE-564, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pembrolizumab in 2021 as an adjuvant treatment for kidney cancer. At the time of the approval, the trial had only gone on long enough to show an improvement in how long people lived without their cancer returning.\n\nBut even with the approval, many oncologists haven‚Äôt been using pembrolizumab routinely as an adjuvant treatment in their higher-risk patients, explained Martin Voss, M.D., and Robert Motzer, M.D., of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in an editorial that accompanied the updated findings.\n\nInstead, they‚Äôve been waiting to find out whether the treatment improves how long people live overall, Drs. Voss and Mosser wrote. With that question now answered, they continued, ‚Äúthe anticipated effect‚Äù on the everyday care of patients ‚Äúcannot be overstated.‚Äù\n\nSome experts, however, anticipate a measured change in treatment. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to be a total paradigm shift,‚Äù said Mark Ball, M.D., of NCI‚Äôs Center for Cancer Research, who specializes in treating kidney cancer.\n\nIn part, that‚Äôs because the updated findings also show that many patients appear to do very well with surgery alone, Dr. Ball said. Giving all patients who meet the approval criteria an expensive drug that can have serious side effects, he continued, would clearly be ‚Äúovertreatment.‚Äù\n\nSo from a research perspective, he said, the next steps are clear: ‚ÄúWe have to get smarter about identifying who is at the highest risk of recurrence.‚Äù\n\nLooking for answers to the overall survival question\n\nMany people with earlier-stage kidney cancer are cured with surgery. But the cancer will return in up to 50% of people, most often those whose cancer has certain high-risk characteristics. Those characteristics include the presence of cancer in the lymph nodes nearest to the tumor or having tumor cells with what are called sarcomatoid features.\n\nAdjuvant therapy is used in many early-stage cancers that can be treated with surgery. It serves as an insurance policy of sorts, reducing the chances of the cancer coming back by killing any cancer cells missed by surgery or that had already escaped from the tumor before surgery.\n\nUntil now, only a single adjuvant therapy for kidney cancer has been available: the targeted therapy sunitinib (Sutent), which was approved by FDA for this use in 2017.\n\nThat approval was based on one clinical trial in which adjuvant sunitinib improved disease-free survival. But the improvement came with severe side effects, and there‚Äôs no evidence that the treatment helps people live longer, Dr. Ball explained.\n\nAs a result, Dr. Ball said, ‚Äúsunitinib is really never prescribed‚Äù for this use.\n\nIn the absence of an adjuvant therapy that‚Äôs proven to help people with earlier-stage kidney cancer live longer, many patients only get routine monitoring, or surveillance, afterward.\n\nSo oncologists have been especially eager to see if, with more time having passed, the promising recurrence-free survival with pembrolizumab in the KEYNOTE-564 trial translated into longer overall survival.\n\nImproved survival at 2, 3, and 4 years\n\nNearly 1,000 people participated in KEYNOTE-564, which was funded by Merck, pembrolizumab‚Äôs manufacturer. All were at increased risk of their cancer coming back after surgery. Participants assigned to pembrolizumab took the drug every 3 weeks for up to 1 year.\n\nMore people in the pembrolizumab group were alive at every time point measured in the study, not just at the 4-year mark.\n\nPeople in the pembrolizumab group also continued to live longer without their cancer returning. At 4 years, 65% of people in the pembrolizumab group had not had a recurrence, compared with 57% in the placebo group.\n\nTime after starting adjuvant treatment\n\nPeople in pembrolizumab group still alive\n\nPeople in placebo group still alive\n\n2 years\n\n96%\n\n94%\n\n3 years\n\n94%\n\n89.5%\n\n4 years\n\n91%\n\n86%\n\nThe findings represent ‚Äúa clinically meaningful survival improvement,‚Äù said the trial‚Äôs lead investigator, Toni Choueiri, M.D., of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, during a presentation of the results at the 2024 ASCO Genitourinary Cancer Symposium in January.\n\nAs was expected, Dr. Choueiri noted, more people in the pembrolizumab group had treatment-related side effects, including those like fatigue and rash that are commonly seen in people treated with the drug.\n\nOverall, about 20% of people in the pembrolizumab group had serious side effects, and 21% stopped treatment early because of side effects (as did 2% of those in the placebo group).\n\nA major shift in treating early-stage kidney cancer?\n\nMore people with early-stage RCC should now get pembrolizumab after surgery, said Pedro Barata, M.D., of the Seidman Cancer Center in Cleveland, who specializes in treating kidney cancer, at the ASCO Genitourinary Cancer Symposium.\n\nDr. Barata said he generally recommends adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab to his patients at a particularly elevated risk of the cancer returning, which he assesses using a recurrence risk model for kidney cancer.\n\nMost patients will only have mild side effects from the treatment, he continued. But ‚Äúsome patients will have significant side effects,‚Äù and the treatments used to manage those side effects have their own side effects.\n\nSo oncologists need to discuss the potential improvements in survival versus the impact of potential side effects, Dr. Barata continued.\n\n‚ÄúWe [must] take into consideration quality of life, patient preferences, and even availability of the drug in some circumstances,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHowever, I would argue that [now] the scales favor adjuvant pembrolizumab.‚Äù\n\nDr. Ball agreed. Unlike with some other cancers for which pembrolizumab is a standard treatment, however, there are no tumor or blood markers that single out patients whose cancer is most likely to respond to the drug.\n\nSo for the time being, he continued, oncologists should rely on well-established risk factors to guide their decision making and treatment recommendations to their patients.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

Sepsis is the body‚Äôs uncontrolled and extreme response to an infection. While the trial did not improve mortality rates in all patients with sepsis regardless of severity, the researchers found that acetaminophen gave the greatest benefit to the patients most at risk for organ damage. With the therapy, those patients needed less assisted ventilation and experienced a slight, though statistically insignificant, decrease in mortality. The study published in JAMA.\n\nIn sepsis, red blood cells become injured and die at abnormally high rates, releasing so called ‚Äúcell-free hemoglobin‚Äù into the blood. The body becomes overwhelmed and can‚Äôt remove this excess hemoglobin which can lead to organ damage. Previous work from Lorraine Ware, M.D., professor of medicine, pulmonary and critical care at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, and the first author of the current study showed that acetaminophen, in addition to relieving pain and reducing fevers, had been shown to block the harmful effects of cell-free hemoglobin on the lungs, which are at major risk of injury during sepsis. Limited research had also suggested that acetaminophen might work better for patients with the most severe sepsis ‚Äì those with higher levels of cell-free hemoglobin, which have been linked to a greater risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome and a higher risk of death.\n\nScientists note that identifying high levels of cell-free hemoglobin as a biomarker that could be tested when patients are first admitted to the hospital would be a breakthrough, because it could help quickly determine which patients with sepsis might benefit from acetaminophen therapy.\n\n‚ÄúOne problem in critical care is the patients get sick so fast, that we do not normally have time to figure out which biomarkers help predict which therapy could give the best outcome,‚Äù said Michael Matthay, M.D., professor of medicine and anesthesia at the University of California, San Francisco, and the senior study author. ‚ÄúWe hope that these findings will underscore the potential therapeutic value of using a biomarker to help successfully find a treatment that will work when patients need it the most.‚Äù\n\nTo test the therapeutic potential of acetaminophen more fully in a mid-stage clinical trial, researchers enrolled 447 adults with sepsis and respiratory or circulatory organ dysfunction at 40 U.S. academic hospitals from October 2021 to April 2023. Patients were randomized to receive either acetaminophen or a placebo intravenously every six hours for five days. The researchers then followed the patients for 28 days to see how they fared. They also completed a special analysis using data only from the patients with levels of cell-free hemoglobin above a certain threshold. The team's primary interest overall was the number of patients who were able to stay alive with no organ support, such as mechanical ventilation or kidney failure treatment.\n\nThe researchers found that intravenous acetaminophen was safe for all the sepsis patients, with no difference in liver injury, low blood pressure, or other adverse events compared to the placebo group. Among secondary outcomes, they also found that organ injury was significantly lower in the acetaminophen group, as was the rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome onset within seven days of hospital admission.\n\nWhen looking more closely at the patients with higher cell-free hemoglobin, the researchers found that just 8% of patients in the acetaminophen group needed assisted ventilation compared to 23% of patients in the placebo group. And after 28 days, 12% of patients in the acetaminophen group had died, compared to 21% in the placebo group, though this finding was not statistically significant.\n\n‚ÄúWhile the anticipated effects of acetaminophen therapy were not realized for all sepsis patients, this study shows that it still holds promise for the most critically ill‚Äù said James Kiley, Ph.D., director of the Division of Lung Diseases at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, part of NIH. ‚ÄúThough, more research is needed to uncover the mechanisms and validate these results.‚Äù\n\nWare said the results for the critically ill patients trended in a hopeful direction. She and Matthay plan to conduct a larger clinical trial, likely enrolling those patients primarily with higher cell-free hemoglobin levels.\n\nFunding: This study was supported by NHLBI grants: U01 HL122989, U01 HL122998, U01 HL123004, U01 HL123008, U01 HL123009, U01 HL123010, U01 HL123018, U01 HL123020, U01 HL123022, U01 HL123023, U01 HL123027, U01 HL123031, and U01 HL123033.\n\n**About the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI):** NHLBI is the global leader in conducting and supporting research in heart, lung, and blood diseases and sleep disorders that advances scientific knowledge, improves public health, and saves lives.

These results are from a first-in-human clinical trial supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health. The study, published in the journal _Vascular Medicine_, could lead to the first effective treatment for the rare disease.\n\nACDC, which has no known cure, often targets the arteries of the legs and can make walking painful and difficult. It can also affect the joints of the hands, causing pain and deformities. In severe cases, the condition can lead to potential limb loss. Symptoms of the disease often begin in the late teens and 20s. An extremely rare disease, it is believed to affect only about 20 people worldwide and has an estimated prevalence of less than 1 in 1 million. Previous studies have identified the gene for ACDC disease and the biochemical mechanism behind it. More recent studies by the NHLBI research team identified an existing drug, called etidronate, as a potential treatment for ACDC based on disease models in animals and human cells.\n\nIn the study, researchers evaluated the safety and effectiveness of etidronate in treating calcification of the arteries and impaired blood flow in the legs of seven people (four women and three men) with ACDC disease. Although few, they collectively represent about one-third of all the known cases in the world. Treatment consisted of taking the oral drug daily for 14 days every three months over a three-year period. The researchers measured calcium deposits using CT scans and tested blood flow using the ankle brachial index, a non-invasive tool, both at the start of the study and as a yearly follow-up after treatment.\n\nResearchers found that etidronate treatments appeared safe, with no adverse side effects reported. The drug appeared to slow the progression of new calcium deposits in the blood vessels of the legs as well as slow the progression of blood flow inhibition. However, the drug did not reverse calcium deposits that were already present in the affected blood vessels and joints, nor did it show clear improvement in blood flow. Questionnaires administered to the patients suggested that symptoms, such as pain and motion impairment, were improved.\n\nResearchers suggest that lessons learned from the current study could allow development of novel therapies for ACDC and larger clinical trials for this disease. The study could also shed light on other diseases involving excessive calcium buildup in the arteries, including peripheral artery disease and atherosclerosis.\n\nReference\n\nFerrante EA, Cudrici CD, Rashidi M, et al.

The research, published in the journal _Circulation_, specifically looked at damage to the hearts of people with SARS-CoV2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a serious lung condition that can be fatal. But researchers said the findings could have relevance to organs beyond the heart and also to viruses other than SARS-CoV-2.\n\nScientists have long known that COVID-19 increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and Long COVID, and prior imaging research has shown that over 50% of people who have severe COVID-19 infections experience some inflammation or damage to the heart. What scientists did not know is whether the damage occurs because the virus infects the heart tissue itself, or because of systemic inflammation triggered by the body‚Äôs well-known immune response to the virus.\n\n‚ÄúThis was a critical question and finding the answer opens up a whole new understanding of the link between this serious lung injury and the kind of inflammation that can lead to cardiovascular complications,‚Äù said Michelle Olive, Ph.D., associate director of the Basic and Early Translational Research Program at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of NIH. ‚ÄúThe research also suggests that suppressing the inflammation through treatments might help minimize these complications.‚Äù\n\nTo reach their findings, the researchers focused on immune cells known as cardiac macrophages, which normally perform a critical role in keeping the tissue healthy but can turn inflammatory in response to injury such as heart attack or heart failure. The researchers analyzed heart tissue specimens from 21 patients who died from SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS and compared them with specimens from 33 patients who died from non-COVID-19 causes. They also infected mice with SARS-CoV-2 to follow what happened to the macrophages after infection.\n\nIn both humans and mice, they found the SARS-CoV-2 infection increased the total number of cardiac macrophages and also caused them to shift from their normal routine and become inflammatory.\n\nWhen macrophages are no longer doing their normal jobs, which includes sustaining the metabolism of the heart and clearing out harmful bacteria or other foreign agents, they weaken the heart and the rest of the body, said Matthias Nahrendorf, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and senior author on the study.\n\nThe researchers then designed a study in mice to test whether the response they observed happened because SARS-CoV-2 was infecting the heart directly, or because the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs was severe enough to render the heart macrophages more inflammatory. This study mimicked the lung inflammation signals, but without the presence of the actual virus. The result: even in the absence of a virus, the mice showed immune responses strong enough to produce the same heart macrophage shift the researchers observed both in the patients who died of COVID-19 and the mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n‚ÄúWhat this study shows is that after a COVID infection, the immune system can inflict remote damage on other organs by triggering serious inflammation throughout the body ‚Äì and this is in addition to damage the virus itself has directly inflicted on the lung tissue,‚Äù said Nahrendorf. ‚ÄúThese findings can also be applied more generally, as our results suggest that any severe infection can send shockwaves through the whole body.‚Äù\n\nThe research team also found that blocking the immune response with a neutralizing antibody in the mice stopped the flow of inflammatory cardiac macrophages and preserved cardiac function. While they have yet to test this in humans, Nahrendorf said a treatment like this could be used as a preventive measure to help COVID-19 patients with pre-existing conditions, or people who are likely to have more severe outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 associated ARDS.\n\nFunding: This study was supported by NHLBI grants: HL139598, HL142494, HL155097, and HL149647.\n\n**About the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI):** NHLBI is the global leader in conducting and supporting research in heart, lung, and blood diseases and sleep disorders that advances scientific knowledge, improves public health, and saves lives.

Osteosarcoma is rare in humans, which makes it difficult to study. Unfortunately, however, it is common in dogs. CCR researchers have long studied naturally occurring osteosarcoma in pets. They recently found that molecular signatures for immune activity in dogs that had favorable clinical outcomes matched the signatures and outcomes in human patients. This research paves the way for improving treatment options for both four-legged and two-legged patients. Credit: iStock\n\nStudying osteosarcoma, an aggressive bone cancer that most commonly occurs in teenagers and young adults, is very difficult because it is diagnosed in fewer than 1,000 people in the United States each year. For that reason, scientists in CCR‚Äôs Comparative Oncology Program (COP) are taking advantage of remarkable similarities between osteosarcoma in humans and dogs to improve treatment options for both people and pets.\n\nIn dogs, osteosarcoma is far more prevalent than it is in humans: U.S. veterinarians diagnose more than 10,000 cases of canine osteosarcoma annually. Senior Scientist and COP Director Amy LeBlanc, D.V.M., says studying osteosarcomas in pets helps researchers learn how the disease behaves when it arises naturally, complementing studies in laboratory models. ‚ÄúStudying dogs with cancer provides another piece of a really complex puzzle and helps give us insight into how cancers form and respond to therapy,‚Äù she says.\n\nTwenty academic veterinary centers in the United States and Canada participate in the NCI‚Äôs Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium, which runs clinical trials to assess novel cancer therapies in pet dogs. As they investigate experimental osteosarcoma treatments in their canine patients, their insights are informing the design of human clinical trials. One recent study, reported by LeBlanc and her team in Communications Biology, offers the most detailed description yet of clinical and molecular similarities between the human and dog form of the disease ‚Äî and points toward potential treatment strategies for both.\n\nLeBlanc and her colleagues examined how osteosarcoma‚Äôs molecular makeup influences its behavior by analyzing tumor samples from nearly 200 dogs. Some of the dogs had better clinical outcomes than others, surviving longer after their osteosarcoma diagnosis or remaining disease-free longer following treatment. LeBlanc‚Äôs team, led by postdoctoral fellow Joshua Mannheimer, Ph.D., found that these outcomes were related to patterns of activity of particular genes in the tumors. Remarkably, the same molecular signatures also correlated with clinical prognosis in human patients with osteosarcoma.\n\nLeBlanc says the composition of those prognostic gene signatures provides clues about the biological factors that influence osteosarcoma outcomes. Many of the genes that comprise the signatures help shape tumor cells‚Äô interactions with the immune system, suggesting more anti-tumor activity occurred in the osteosarcoma patients that fared better. ‚ÄúThat speaks to one of the big pictures that we're learning about cancer,‚Äù LeBlanc says. ‚ÄúThe more that your immune system is aware and active, the better the outcome you may have as a patient, whether you're four-legged or two-legged.‚Äù\n\nA next step will be to investigate why many patients, both human and canine, lack a strong immune response to osteosarcoma and how their immune systems could be empowered to control their cancer. Laboratory studies of immune cells‚Äô interactions with osteosarcoma tumors will complement NCI-supported clinical trials investigating immunotherapy treatments for canine osteosarcoma and could set the stage for more targeted therapies in dogs and humans. ‚ÄúThere's a huge amount of value in studying dogs and the diseases they get, and we‚Äôre just getting started,‚Äù LeBlanc says.\n\nReference\n\nMannheimer, J.D., et al.

The global prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents is on the rise, with projections indicating over 250 million will be affected by 2030. While environmental changes are major contributors to this increase, genetic factors also play a significant role, with studies indicating a heritability rate of up to 67%. Obesity is not merely about excess fat accumulation; it leads to serious cardiometabolic complications. Increased body weight in children and adolescents can also result in prediabetes or diabetes, increased blood pressure of up to 25% among children with obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), estimated to be 40% in children with body mass index (BMI) at or above 95th percentile. Another critical aspect of obesity is the accumulation of adipose tissue and dyslipidemia, which is clinically manifested through altered lipid profiles such as increased cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides (TGs) and decreased high-density lipoprotein.\n\nLipid metabolism has been studied for decades with the aim to map their chemical diversity and functionality. Recent advancements in mass spectrometry (MS) have enabled mapping of single molecular structures. In obesity, the lipidome profile is significantly altered and recent studies reported that sphingolipids and phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) are key drivers of cardiometabolic complications. Despite these findings, there remains a gap in research specifically addressing pediatric health and the lipid profiles in children and adolescents with obesity.\n\nHere, we performed MS-based plasma lipidomics and deep clinical phenotyping in children from the HOLBAEK study. This cross-sectional study includes 1,331 children and adolescents with normal weight, overweight or obesity. Furthermore, the intervention study includes 186 children with overweight or obesity receiving the Holbaek obesity treatment, which is a family-based, individual-centered, comprehensive, nonpharmacological management with follow-up visits at the Children‚Äôs Obesity Clinic, Holbaek Hospital, Denmark. Our goal was to understand the role of lipid classes in pediatric obesity and to study single lipid associations of cardiometabolic risk profiles, including hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and hypertension.\n\nIn our analysis, we identified plasma lipid signatures through 227 annotated lipids. These, when tested against cardiometabolic risk features such as hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and cardiometabolic traits, related to liver function and glucose metabolism, indicating distinct class-wide lipid dynamics. Specifically, we observed that higher levels of ceramides (Cers), PE and phosphatidylinositols (PIs) were associated with worsened cardiometabolic risk profiles, whereas sphingomyelins (SMs) were protective and associated with reduced cardiometabolic risks. The mechanism behind the Cer production in the body is highly dependent on SM and fatty acids. Moreover, SM depletion has been found to correlate with inflammation and Cer in recent years has been linked with future development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The rise in inflammatory cytokines and Cer in the circulation is proposed as a key mechanism in the development of atherosclerosis. Moreover, recent research has linked lipids from the PE and PI classes with conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), CVD and steatotic liver disease, underscoring their significance in disease progression and potential treatment monitoring. Our observations of the associations between these lipid species and cardiometabolic risk profiles in children and adolescents suggests that the impact of these lipids on metabolic disturbances emerges early in life.\n\nThe analysis of individual species demonstrated that children decreasing their degree of obesity exhibited decreased levels of TG, Cer, PE and PI species. Our findings suggest that specific lipids partly mediated cardiometabolic complications from obesity. Understanding which lipid molecules to target is key for potential interventions and treatments, thereby preventing the progression of pediatric obesity into severe complications.\n\nResults\n\nStudy design and participant characteristics\n\nThe study population consisted of children and adolescents from the HOLBAEK study, previously known as the Danish Childhood Obesity Biobank, including an obesity clinic cohort, in which children and adolescents with a BMI\u2009‚â•\u200990th percentile (BMI standard deviation score (SDS)\u2009‚â•\u20091.28) according to a Danish reference participated in a multidisciplinary nonpharmacological obesity management program at the Children‚Äôs Obesity Clinic, Holb√¶k Hospital; and a population-based cohort, recruited from schools across 11 municipalities in Zealand, Denmark.\n\nAnthropometry, whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan and blood parameters were assessed as described previously. Untargeted lipidomic profiling was performed on 1,363 children and adolescents who had baseline examinations, as well as 186 participants who received obesity management at baseline and had a median follow-up duration of 1.1 years. We performed a cross-sectional analysis on 1,331 participants divided into normal weight (n\u2009=\u2009373) and overweight/obesity groups (n\u2009=\u2009958) and a longitudinal analysis on 186 children and adolescents with overweight or obesity. A schematic study design is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nLipidomic profiles were measured in 373 children and adolescents with normal weight and 958 with overweight or obesity. We investigated lipid dysregulation in relation to overweight/obesity, cardiometabolic risk profiles, known CVD-related and inflammatory markers, and the predictive ability to detect hepatic steatosis. In addition, lipidomic profiles were measured in a subset of children and adolescents who received nonpharmacological obesity treatment. The lipidome response to BMI SDS reduction and longitudinal associations between lipids and cardiometabolic traits were examined. Mediation and sensitivity analyses were conducted.\n\nIn the cross-sectional study, the overweight/obesity and normal weight groups differed significantly in anthropometrics and cardiometabolic risk profiles except for sex, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Specifically, the overweight/obesity group had higher BMI SDS, waist, waist/hip ratio (WHR), body fat %, liver fat % and elevated levels of liver enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and Œ≥-glutamyl transferase (GGT). They also exhibited elevated levels of traditional lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and TG, as well as higher glycemic parameters, including glucose, insulin, C-peptide and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Other notable differences included higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), leptin, leptin/adiponectin ratio, glucagon, total glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), systolic blood pressure (SBP) SDS and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) SDS. They also had lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and adiponectin. In comparison to the normal weight group, the overweight/obesity group exhibited a higher prevalence of hepatic steatosis defined as liver fat ‚â• 5.0 % (15.6% versus 0%), high ALT (38.7% versus 12.6%), dyslipidemia (38.0% versus 10.8%), hyperglycemia (14.0% versus 8.6%), insulin resistance (35.0% versus 5.6%) and hypertension (15.9% versus 3.0%).\n\nAssociations of lipid species with overweight or obesity\n\nDifferentially abundant lipids revealed a gradual change among the three weight statuses (normal weight, overweight and obesity), after adjusting for age and sex. Among 227 annotated lipid species, 142 exhibited significant differences across normal weight, overweight and obesity (P\u2009<\u20095% false discovery rate (FDR)). The pairwise comparisons revealed 121 lipids significantly differed between normal weight and obesity, 43 between overweight and normal weight and 60 between overweight and obesity.\n\nLogistic regression analyses for normal weight versus overweight/obesity revealed 87 significant lipid species in 13 lipid classes, of which 52 were positively and 35 were negatively associated, independent of age and sex (P\u2009<\u20095% FDR). Notably, 20% measured Cers (3 of 15), 33% measured SMs (5 of 15), 47% TGs (25 of 53), all diacylglyceride (DG) (2 of 2) and 40% FAs (2 of 5) were positively associated, whereas the majority of glycerophospholipids, including 33% N,N-dimethyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (dMePE) (1 of 3), 30% lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (7 of 23) and 60% lysophosphatidyethanolamine (LPE) (3 of 5) displayed negative associations and PCs, PEs and PIs showed more divergent trends in associations.\n\nThe interaction of obesity with age related lipid species\n\nA partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plot of lipids between three age groups in normal weight and overweight/obesity groups is shown. Three age groups (age group 1, girls aged <9 years and boys aged <10 years; age group 2, girls aged 9‚Äì15 years and boys aged 10‚Äì16 years; age group 3, girls aged >15 years and boys aged >16 years) were defined according to the approximate pubertal development. Compared to the more pronounced separation between age groups 1 and 2 (larger than between age groups 2 and 3) in the normal weight group, age group 1 did not yield such a clear separation in the overweight/obesity group. We, therefore, assessed whether weight status modifies the association between continuous age and lipid species by including an interaction term ((overweight/obesity versus normal weight)\u2009√ó\u2009age) for each lipid species, adjusting for sex. Significant interactions (P\u2009<\u20090.05) were detected in 26 lipid species, with lysophospholipids showing the most pronounced increase with age in the normal weight group compared to the overweight/obesity group, including lysodimethylphosphatidylethanolamine (LdMePE) (0:0 and 16:0), LdMePE (16:0 and 0:0), LPC (0:0 and 16:0), LPC (16:0 and 0:0). Two polyunsaturated FAs, FA(20:4) and FA(22:6), were decreased with age only in the overweight/obesity group. We detected statistically significant lower levels of these five lysophospholipids in age group 3 when comparing participants with normal weight to participants with overweight or obesity.\n\nAssociations of lipid species with cardiometabolic risk\n\nA total of 135 lipids had at least one significant association (P\u2009<\u20095% FDR) with cardiometabolic risk feature after adjusting for age, sex and BMI SDS. Seventeen sphingolipids, including 9 Cers, were associated with higher prevalence of hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, whereas 8 SMs were associated with lower prevalence. Nine PEs and eight PIs were shown to have positive associations with hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance.\n\nPredictive performance of lipids to detect hepatic steatosis\n\nGiven their clinical relevance, we explored the predictive potential of cardiometabolic-associated lipids for detecting hepatic steatosis, defined as liver fat above 5%. Employing feature selection techniques, we identified a three-lipid panel comprising PI(32:1), PE(36:1) and Cer(d42:0). This panel demonstrated a mean cross-validated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (95% CI 0.77‚Äì0.81) through fivefold cross-validation repeated ten times. Furthermore, integration of this lipid panel with three liver enzymes (ALT, AST and GGT) significantly increased the AUC from 0.78 (95% CI 0.76‚Äì0.8) to 0.82 (95% CI 0.81‚Äì0.84).\n\nMediation effect of lipids on cardiometabolic traits\n\nWe conducted mediation analysis to explore the role of 87 obesity-associated lipids on cardiometabolic traits, adjusting for age and sex. Overall, 83 lipids significantly mediated the effect of obesity on 19 cardiometabolic traits, with a median mediation proportion of 5%. Notably, certain PCs and TGs exhibited particularly substantial mediation proportions, surpassing 20% in traditional lipid profiles. Specifically, TG(52:1) demonstrated partial mediation effects across cardiometabolic traits. Additionally, SMs, LPEs and LPCs were found to exert a negative mediation effect on the association between obesity and glycemic traits, with mediation proportions ranging from 5% to 23% for glucose.\n\nThe effect of personalized obesity management\n\nA subset of 186 children and adolescents with overweight or obesity, comprising 84 boys and with a median age of 11.6 years (interquartile range (IQR) 9.9‚Äì13.7), underwent obesity management for a median duration of 1.1 years (IQR 1.0‚Äì1.2). Among them, 154 participants experienced a decrease in BMI SDS, whereas 32 maintained or increased their BMI SDS. Across all participants, there was a median reduction in BMI SDS of ‚àí0.39 (IQR ‚àí0.76 to ‚àí0.07) from baseline to follow-up, accompanied by a median decrease in body fat content of ‚àí2.85 (IQR ‚àí6.53 to ‚àí0.38) (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Furthermore, significant improvements were observed in WHR, LDH, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, HbA1c and DBP SDS (all P\u2009<\u20090.001). Liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT and bilirubin) and glycemic traits (C-peptide, insulin and glucose) did not show significant improvements in all participants or the subgroup with decreased BMI SDS, but worsened in those who increased BMI SDS.\n\nBefore investigating the lipidome response to obesity management, we examined the baseline associations of BMI SDS with lipids and how these associations evolved with BMI SDS reduction. Utilizing the baseline data from the intervention study as a replication set, we found that 25 of 58 lipids associated with BMI SDS in children with overweight/obesity from the cross-sectional study also exhibited significant and consistent associations at baseline in the intervention study. Additionally, 24 lipids showed directionally consistent trends but did not reach statistical significance.\n\nA comparison of lipid profiles before and after obesity management revealed significant changes. Among the 145 lipids examined, significant increases were observed in 44 lipids, including PCs, LPCs and LPEs. In contrast, 23 lipids, including Cers, SM and TGs were significantly decreased.\n\nFurthermore, we investigated the lipidome changes in response to continuous BMI SDS reduction and their associations with cardiometabolic traits. A total of 62 lipid species demonstrated significant associations with BMI SDS reduction, out of which 45 were also significantly associated with BMI SDS at baseline. Of note, TGs exhibited the greatest reduction following BMI SDS reduction. Additionally, nine sphingolipids including Cers and SMs and four glycerophospholipids, including PEs and PIs were significantly decreased.\n\nDiscussion\n\nObesity impacts multiple organs. In our study, children and adolescents with overweight or obesity were heavily burdened by cardiometabolic risk. Nearly 38% had dyslipidemia, over 30% displayed hepatic steatosis and over 15% exhibited hypertension.\n\nWe found elevated plasma concentrations of Cer and TG in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity. Cer lipid molecules, emerging as early biomarkers for CVD, play crucial roles in cellular stress, inflammation signaling and apoptosis. Large TG, particularly those containing 54 and 56 carbons and little FA unsaturation, were elevated; however, more evidence is needed to understand specific TG biological function in obesity.\n\nOur investigation also explored lipidome variations across age in children and adolescents with obesity compared to normal-weight individuals. The main driver in age-stratification was phospholipid metabolism. We observed reductions in the levels of LdMePE(16:0), LPC(16:0) and LPC(14:0). While little is known about specific FA chains in lysophospholipids, these are active lipids involved in FA transport in the brain. Furthermore, children with obesity had depleted levels of omega-3 FAs, such as docosahexaenoic acid, indicating a diet poor in essential FAs and potentially impacting availability of docosahexaenoic acid in the brain. The implications of these alterations for developmental outcomes like puberty onset and cognitive development warrant further dedicated research.\n\nIntegration of lipidomics with cardiometabolic risk profiles revealed that increased Cer and decreased SM were associated with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. C-peptide, HOMA-IR, insulin and glucose levels, correlated with Cer level and negatively with SM. SM and Cer are closely linked metabolically and elevated Cer in blood is linked to a risk of developing T2D, hepatic steatosis and CVD. Although the mechanisms are still elusive, general inflammatory signals such as cytokines are thought to upregulate Cer synthesis. Cer also correlated with FGF21, a reported CVD biomarker and the inflammatory cytokine CDCP1, which has been linked with myocardial infarction and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.\n\nIncreased levels of specific PIs and PEs were associated with hepatic steatosis in children and adolescents. Notably, PI(32:1) showed a strong association with liver traits and inflammatory cytokines. A previous study involving 42 children with obesity reported links between hepatic steatosis and elevated levels of PEs, as have adult MASLD studies. We therefore compared the diagnostic accuracy of a three-lipid panel with that of liver enzymes (ALT, AST and GGT) in assessing hepatic steatosis in children. The lipid panel performance was in line with liver enzymes, and integrating enzymes and lipids yielded 82% overall diagnostic accuracy, highlighting the potential for routine clinical evaluations.\n\nWe examined the mediating effects of lipids on the association between obesity and cardiometabolic outcomes and found that most lipids demonstrated partial effects on cardiometabolic traits. Notably, certain TGs mediated effects across glycemic and liver traits, whereas SMs exhibited a negative mediation effect on glycemic traits, by lowering glucose levels. These findings suggest that SMs, LPEs and LPCs may play a protective role in regulating glucose homeostasis in children.\n\nOur intervention study aimed to reduce the degree of obesity and cardiometabolic risk, with 83% of participants reducing their BMI SDS. The clinical profile improved, including decreases in total body and liver fat, circulating lipoproteins and blood pressure; however, circulating total TG did not change, though specific TGs investigated with lipidomics did. Approximately 17% participants did not reduce their BMI SDS and this group exhibited increased circulating C-peptide levels and potential prediabetes risk.\n\nDietary and exercise interventions have long been recognized as tools to improve dyslipidemia in obesity. In our study, the overall lipidome changes were clear: BMI SDS reduction was associated with reductions in all lipid classes. TGs were drastically reduced, while cardiometabolic-associated Cer, PE and PI also decreased with BMI SDS reduction. Particularly Cer(42:0) and Cer(40:1), linked to all-cause mortality in adults with diabetes, decreased in response to BMI SDS reduction. Changes in Cer were associated with changes in ALT levels after adjusting for baseline BMI SDS and change in BMI SDS, indicating improved liver function. Changes in PE(40:1) and PI(36:1) were associated with changes in HOMA-IR and insulin levels, suggesting a potential role in modulating insulin resistance.\n\nMediation analysis revealed that changes in 66 lipids partially affected cardiometabolic traits, with an average mediation proportion of 23%. Changes in Cer(d42:0) partially mediated reduced ALT levels, while some PCs and TGs mediated improvements in HOMA-IR and insulin levels, with proportions ranging from 9% to 26%.\n\nTo consolidate the intervention results a subset of lipids from seven lipid classes replicated with baseline BMI SDS using data from overweight/obesity group in the cross-sectional and baseline data from children with obesity in the intervention study were selected. Twenty-two of these lipids in six lipid classes were significantly decreased with BMI SDS reduction. Of these, 21 lipids mediated changes in cardiometabolic traits.\n\nOverall, our findings emphasize that lipid dysregulation and potential lipid-mediated damage can be reversed through personalized, clinically based obesity management in children and adolescents. However, given the heterogeneous nature of obesity, pharmacological interventions might be necessary for specific lipids if lifestyle management is ineffective.\n\nLimitations of this study include the lack of ethnic diversity, as it was conducted in a majority white pediatric population. Genetic factors, diet and exercise likely impacted the baseline lipidome. The steatosis liver predictor was calculated in 71 cases and a larger diagnostic group is needed for validation. Notably, without a control group it was not possible to definitively attribute changes in lipid species solely to obesity management. A strength of this study was the inclusion of two large cohorts of deeply phenotyped children and adolescents from a population-based study.\n\nIn conclusion, lipidomics profiling has highlighted lipids potentially involved in the disease pathology of childhood obesity and associated with cardiometabolic complications. Personalized obesity management can beneficially modify the overall lipidome in children and adolescents.\n\nMethods\n\nEthics\n\nAccording to the Declaration of Helsinki, written informed consent was obtained from all participants. An informed oral assent was given by the participant if the participant was younger than 18 and then the parents gave informed written consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Region Zealand, Denmark and by the Danish Data Protection Agency. The HOLBAEK study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nStudy population\n\nBoth cohorts from the HOLBAEK study were enrolled between January 2009 and April 2019. Among 1,363 children and adolescents with available lipidome profiles in the cross-sectional study, participants were excluded based on diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus or T2D; intake of medications including statins, insulin, metformin and liraglutide; meeting T2D criteria based on blood sample (fasting plasma glucose\u2009‚â•\u20097.0\u2009mmol\u2009l‚àí1 and/or HbA1c\u2009‚â•\u200948\u2009mmol\u2009mol‚àí1); the interval between visit and blood sample collection >90 days; underweight (BMI\u2009<\u20095th percentile (BMI SDS\u2009<\u2009‚àí1.64)). As a result, 1,331 participants were included in the cross-sectional analysis and divided into normal weight (BMI\u2009‚â•\u20095th and BMI\u2009<\u200990th percentile), and overweight/obesity (BMI\u2009‚â•\u200990th percentile) groups. Participants with obesity (BMI\u2009‚â•\u200999th percentile) were further stratified as indicated.\n\nChildren and adolescents with overweight or obesity enrolled in the multidisciplinary, family-based and individual-centered obesity clinic cohort received comprehensive management using an evidence-based treatment protocol which comprises a range of recommendations on nutrition, including meal exercises, picky eating, exercise, inactivity, border setting promoting growth, development and improved physical, mental and social thriving, as previously described. The intervention study included 186 children and adolescents with overweight or obesity, who were followed for a median of 1.1 years. Their lipidomic profiles were available at both baseline and follow-up.\n\nAnthropometric measurements\n\nIn the obesity clinic cohort, anthropometrics were obtained at clinical examinations, whereas the population-based group was assessed in a mobile laboratory by medical professionals. Weight, height, waist and WHR were measured. BMI SDS was calculated based on a Danish reference. For SBP and DBP, mean values for the last two measurements of blood pressure were calculated and converted to blood pressure SDS based on age-, sex- and height-specific reference values from the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nLipidomics\n\nEDTA plasma or serum sample preparation for lipidomic analysis has been described previously. In brief, 10\u2009Œºl plasma was mixed with 10\u2009Œºl 0.9% w/v NaCl(aq) and internal standards containing 120\u2009Œºl chloroform:methanol (2:1) mixture. The lipid containing chloroform was analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight MS. Samples were analyzed in a randomized order with quality control pooled plasma samples at regular intervals throughout the run. The lipidomics data were pre-processed with MZmine2 and lipid features were normalized to internal standards and log transformed. The data were cross matched with an in-house library where 227 lipid features from 16 different lipid classes were identified at level 1 and 2. We excluded lipids with >20% missing data across all samples and relative standard deviation (RSD) values\u2009>\u200920% across quality control samples. Serum lipidomics raw files from the intervention study were pre-processed with Skyline, where a list of targets were generated from the in-house library applied to the first study. Lipids were normalized to internal standards and log transformed. Features with RSD\u2009>\u200920% were excluded and only 145 lipids found in the cross-sectional study were considered in the intervention analysis.\n\nThe identified lipids from both studies were standardized to have a mean of 0 and s.d. of 1. Lipids were classified into classes: cholesteryl ester (CE), Cer, DG, dMePE, FA, hexosylceramides (HexCer), LdMePE, LPC, LPE, PC, PE, alkyl or alkenyl ether PEs, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), PI, SM and TG. In particular, lipid species were classified into three major classes: sphingolipids (Cer, HexCer and SM), glycerophospholipids (dMePE, LdMePE, LPC, LPE, PC, PE, PE-O/P, PG and PI) and other lipids (CE, DG, TG and FA).\n\nDXA examination\n\nWhole-body DXA scans were performed and total body fat percentage was quantified in the overweight/obesity, normal weight groups and children and adolescents with overweight or obesity who received the obesity management, using a GE Lunar Prodigy and thereafter using a GE Lunar iDXA.\n\n1H-MRS examination\n\nLiver fat content was quantified in the overweight/obesity and normal weight groups and children and adolescents with overweight or obesity received obesity management, using a 3T Achieva MR imaging system.\n\nBiochemical analyses\n\nVenous blood samples were collected after overnight fasting. Fasting biochemical measurements including in plasma: ALT, AST, GGT, LDH and bilirubin, HDL-C, LDL-C, TC, TG, in serum: insulin, C-peptide, hs-CRP, leptin, adiponectin, leptin:adiponectin ratio and in whole blood HbA1c were assessed as previously described.\n\nDefining cardiometabolic risk features\n\nHepatic steatosis was defined using two cutoffs of liver fat: ‚â•5.0%, cutoff used in adults histological; and ‚â•1.5%, a cutoff used by our group that has shown to represent more accurately the upper normal limit of liver fat content in children and adolescents. We also defined high ALT (above 24.5\u2009U\u2009l‚àí1 in girls and above 31.5\u2009U\u2009l‚àí1 in boys), which was found to be the optimal cutoff for diagnosing hepatic steatosis (liver fat\u2009>\u20091.5%) by our group. Hyperglycemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose ‚â•5.6‚Äì6.9\u2009mmol\u2009l‚àí1 and/or HbA1c\u2009‚â•\u200939‚Äì47\u2009mmol\u2009mol‚àí1, according to the American Diabetes Association guidelines for prediabetes. Insulin resistance was defined based on HOMA-IR value above the 90th percentile of previously published age- and sex-specific population-based reference values from our group. HOMA-IR was calculated as (insulin mU\u2009l‚àí1\u2009√ó\u2009glucose mM)/22.5. Dyslipidemia was defined as values above the 95th percentile according to pediatric guidelines, corresponding to TC\u2009‚â•\u2009200\u2009mg\u2009dl‚àí1 (5.2\u2009mM), LDL-C\u2009‚â•\u2009130\u2009mg\u2009dl‚àí1 (3.4\u2009mM), TG\u2009‚â•\u2009100\u2009mg\u2009dl‚àí1 (1.1\u2009mM) for 0‚Äì9 years or ‚â•130\u2009mg\u2009dl‚àí1 (1.5\u2009mM) for 10‚Äì19 years or HDL-C\u2009<\u200940\u2009mg\u2009dl‚àí1 (1.0\u2009mM). Hypertension was defined as a SBP and/or DBP above the 95th percentile for age, height and sex.\n\nCVD-related and inflammatory markers\n\nA proximity extension assay was performed using the Target 96 Cardiovascular II (CVDII) and Target 96 Inflammation (INF) panels from Olink Proteomics on EDTA plasma, as previously described. Proximity extension assay technology uses nucleic acid labeling of antibodies in combination with qPCR, producing normalized protein expression values as an arbitrary unit on a log2 scale. Overall, 85 markers from CVDII and 64 markers from INF were included as >80% of individuals were above the detection limit.\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R software. Data are expressed as median (IQR) for continuous variables or frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test (for continuous variables) and the chi-squared test (for categorical variables) were used to test differences in characteristics between two groups.\n\nDifferential expression analysis was applied to weight status (normal weight, overweight and obesity) using ANOVA adjusting for age and sex, followed by a Tukey‚Äôs honestly significant difference (Tukey‚Äôs HSD) post hoc test for pairwise comparisons. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of each lipid individually with overweight/obesity versus normal weight adjusted for age and sex. PLS-DA was performed to examine the lipidomes differences between the three age groups, separately for obesity/overweight and normal weight groups using ropls package. Tenfold cross-validation and 300 permutations were used. The first two component scores were plotted in a score plot, where each point represents an individual.\n\nThe effect of obesity on the association between continuous age and individual lipid species was tested by a corresponding interaction model including an interaction term (age\u2009√ó\u2009overweight/obesity versus normal weight) adjusting for sex. Cardiometabolic traits were log transformed except for BMI SDS, SBP SDS and DBP SDS. The associations of lipids with cardiometabolic risk features and cardiometabolic traits were examined using multiple logistic and linear regressions adjusted for age, sex and BMI SDS when pooling the normal weight and overweight/obesity groups. The interaction between sex and lipid species (lipid\u2009√ó\u2009sex) was examined in linear regression models for cardiometabolic traits, adjusted for age and BMI SDS. The obesity interaction (lipid\u2009√ó\u2009overweight/obesity versus normal weight) was also tested in the linear regression models for cardiometabolic traits. The reported estimates (Œ≤ or OR) are based on a 1-s.d. unit increase in independent variables. Spearman correlations between lipids with CVD and inflammatory markers were tested and the correlation coefficients and the P values were obtained using the rcorr function in the Hmisc package. Multiple testing correction was performed based on FDR at 5% and a stringent Bonferroni adjusted P\u2009<\u20092.2\u2009√ó\u200910‚àí4 (0.05 of 227 lipids tested), separately for each outcome. P\u2009<\u20095% FDR was considered statistically significant. In all figures, only those lipids with at least one outcome association reaching FDR significance were included. Changes in lipid profiles before and after obesity management were assessed while adjusting for age and sex. Linear mixed models were employed using the gls function from the nlme package. The effects of BMI SDS reduction on lipid profiles were analyzed using linear regressions controlling for age, sex and treatment duration. The associations between changes in lipid profiles and changes in continuous cardiometabolic traits were examined using linear regressions controlling for age, sex, treatment duration, baseline BMI SDS and change in BMI SDS. BMI SDS reduction was calculated as the difference between BMI SDS at baseline and BMI SDS at follow-up. Changes in lipid profiles and cardiometabolic traits were calculated as the difference between the values at follow-up and those at baseline. The chord diagram and heatmaps were created using the circlize and ComplexHeatmap R packages.\n\nPrediction model\n\nWe performed feature selection for hepatic steatosis, defined as liver fat above 5%, using the maximum relevance and minimum redundancy method, implemented in the njab Python package. Through fivefold cross-validation repeated ten times, this analysis identified a three-lipid panel that achieved the highest mean ROC AUC. Furthermore, we evaluated the discriminative performance of three clinical used liver enzymes (ALT, AST and GGT), both individually and in combination with the lipid panel using the same cross-validation method. To mitigate imbalanced class distribution, a downsampling approach was applied to the majority class within each cross-validation fold. The statistical comparison of AUCs was conducted using DeLong‚Äôs test. These analyses were performed using the caret and pROC R package.\n\nMediation analysis\n\nIn the cross-sectional study, mediation analysis was performed to explore the mediating role of obesity-associated lipids on cardiometabolic traits. Bootstrapping with 1,000 iterations was employed to estimate direct, indirect and total effects across obesity‚Äìlipid‚Äìtrait triangles adjusted for age and sex. We examined 518 potential paths identifying significant associations between obesity ‚Üí lipid ‚Üí traits at a significance level of P\u2009<\u20095% FDR. The proportion of the effect mediated from obesity through the lipid was determined by dividing its indirect effect by the total effect. In the intervention study, mediation analysis was performed to examine the mediation effect of lipid changes on the association between BMI SDS reduction and changes in cardiometabolic traits adjusting for age, sex and treatment duration. We tested 253 possible paths (BMI SDS reduction ‚Üí lipid change ‚Üí trait change associations at nominal significance P\u2009<\u20090.05). Bootstrap confidence intervals were used to assess the statistical significance of the mediation effects. Mediation analyses were performed using the mediation R package.\n\nSensitivity analyses\n\nWe matched individuals in the obesity group to those in the normal weight group by age and sex using the MatchIt R package. The matched obesity group has a median age of 9.10 (IQR 7.53‚Äì10.18), while the normal weight group has a median age of 8.35 (6.87‚Äì12.42). We performed a subanalysis to investigate the interaction between obesity and the association of age with 26 previously identified lipids using age- and sex-matched overweight/obesity and normal weight groups. To explore the impact of TC and TG on lipid‚Äìtrait association, we tested the association between 34 cardiometabolic-associated lipids and traits adjusted for age, sex, BMI SDS, TC and TG. To identify common lipids associated with BMI SDS in both the cross-sectional and intervention studies, we performed linear regression analyses between BMI SDS and lipid species adjusting for age and sex. These analyses utilized data from the overweight/obesity group in the cross-sectional study and baseline data from the intervention study.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\nData availability\n\nAll results from statistical and bioinformatics analysis are provided in Supplementary Tables.

A recent systematic review sheds light on this pressing issue.\n\nKey findings from the analysis of 23 studies reveal:\n\n- A significant lack of knowledge regarding risk factors, causes, and treatments for diabetes-related foot conditions (DFRC) among patients.\n- Ethnic minority populations face more barriers to accessing care, highlighting disparities in healthcare.\n- Emotional impacts of ulcers vary, with qualitative data showing feelings of both hope and hopelessness.\n- Many patients struggle with self-care, leading to suboptimal health habits and delayed care seeking.\n- While ethnicity did not correlate with self-care habits in qualitative studies, quantitative analyses indicated increased barriers for ethnic minorities.\n- DFRC affects multiple life dimensions, including social interactions, emotional well-being, and daily activities, ultimately impacting overall quality of life.\n\nThis review is the first to systematically explore how ethnicity influences patient-reported outcomes in DFRC. Yet, limitations such as inconsistent ethnicity reporting in studies remain a challenge.\n\nHow can we better address these disparities in care and improve outcomes for all patients?', ['Healthcare & Policy', 'DiabetesCare', 'HealthEquity', 'PatientOutcomes', 'DiabeticFoot', 'HealthcareDisparities'], 'https://fal.media/files/zebra/6ULbv5PCbknanUU4QmNKq.png', 'http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/diabetic-foot-problems-disrupt-lives-across-ethnicities-2024a1000h73', 'You are a content strategist specializing in crafting engaging and informative social media posts for healthcare professionals based on detailed medical articles or web content.

Tucker\n\nTOPLINE:\n--------\n\nDiabetes-related foot conditions (DFRC) profoundly and negatively affect patient-reported outcomes and experience. Limited evidence suggests that this differs by ethnicity.\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n------------\n\n*   Data synthesis of 23 studies of patient-reported outcomes or experiences with DRFC and reported patient ethnicity, including 11 qualitative studies, 11 quantitative, and one mixed.\n\nTAKEAWAY:\n---------\n\n*   Lack of knowledge about risk, cause, outcomes, and treatment was a key finding across analyses.\n*   Barriers to accessing care was also a common theme, with ethnic minority populations experiencing more barriers in the quantitative findings.\n*   Ulcers produced significant emotional impact in the qualitative analyses, but the quantitative data were mixed.\n*   Feelings of both hope and hopelessness were identified in both analyses.\n*   Many participants in both analyses experienced barriers to self-care, resulting in suboptimal habits and delaying seeking care.\n*   Ethnicity was not related to self-care habits in the qualitative analyses, but there was some evidence of increased barriers for ethnic minorities in the quantitative analyses.\n*   In the qualitative analyses, multiple life dimensions were affected by DRFC, including social life, other conditions, dependence on others, emotional and psychological impact, impact on work and daily life, suggesting an impact on overall quality of life without differences across ethnicities.\n\nIN PRACTICE:\n------------\n\n"DRFC significantly impact patient-reported outcomes and experiences, and some aspects of this relationship may be moderated by sociodemographic factors such as ethnicity," the authors wrote. "To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to investigate the influence of ethnicity on patient-reported outcomes and experience in DRFC‚Ä¶many studies in this area do not explicitly report participant ethnicity," they added.\n\nSOURCE:\n-------\n\nConducted by Patrick Highton, PhD, of Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester General Hospital, Leicester, UK, and the National Institute for Health and Care Research Applied Research Collaboration East Midlands, Leicester, UK, and colleagues, the study was published online in the October 2024 issue of Diabetic Medicine.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n------------\n\nThe inability to meta-analyse quantitative data due to study design and outcome heterogeneity, the limited number of studies comparing outcomes across different ethnic groups, and the overall lack of ethnicity reporting in the relevant literature. Five of the quantitative studies used non-validated instruments. Identification of potentially ethnicity-relevant outcomes depended on subjective reviewer interpretation. Reported views may be highly context specific.\n\nDISCLOSURES:\n------------\n\nThe study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Applied Research Collaboration East Midlands, and carried out in part at the NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

A recent study from the Netherlands sheds light on this pressing issue.\n\nKey findings from a cohort of 3,604 couples trying to conceive:\n\n- FECUNDABILITY: Higher BMI is linked to lower chances of conception. Each unit increase in BMI decreases fecundability for both men and women. Overweight and obese women face significantly reduced fecundability compared to their normal-weight counterparts.\n- SUBFERTILITY: \n  - Underweight women are 88% more likely to experience subfertility than normal-weight women.\n  - Overweight and obese women are 35% and 67% more likely to face subfertility, respectively.\n  - Obese men have a 69% higher likelihood of subfertility compared to normal-weight men.\n- MISCARRIAGE RISK: Overweight and obese women are 49% and 44% more likely to experience miscarriage than normal-weight women.\n\nThe authors emphasize the importance of optimizing BMI in the preconception period to enhance fertility and improve pregnancy outcomes. \n\nHow can we better support our patients in achieving a healthy BMI before conception?', ['Healthcare & Policy', 'Fertility', 'ReproductiveHealth', 'PublicHealth', 'Obesity', 'Healthcare'], 'https://fal.media/files/koala/2yGebj9vcqgWaOpuOm51T.png', 'http://medscape.co.uk/viewarticle/higher-bmi-both-women-and-men-tied-lower-fertility-2024a1000h5m', 'You are a content strategist specializing in crafting engaging and informative social media posts for healthcare professionals based on detailed medical articles or web content.

In women, overweight and obesity are associated with higher risk for miscarriage. These were the main findings of a large population-based prospective cohort study of Dutch couples trying to get pregnant or in early pregnancy.\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n------------\n\n*   This study was a population-based, prospective cohort of 3604 women and their partners living in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and actively trying to conceive or already pregnant (2017-2021).\n*   The exposure was BMI measured in preconception or early in pregnancy.\n*   The main outcomes were fecundability (ie, the probability of conceiving within 1 month), subfertility (ie, the time to pregnancy or duration of actively seeking pregnancy for > 12 months, or the use of assisted reproductive technology), and miscarriage (ie, pregnancy loss before 22 weeks of gestation). These outcomes were assessed by questionnaire or through the obstetric caregiver.\n\nTAKEAWAY:\n---------\n\n*   Fecundability: Men and women with higher BMI have lower fundability; for every unit increase in BMI, fecundability was lower. Women who were overweight and obese had lower fecundability than normal weight women.\n*   Subfertility: Underweight women were 88% more likely than normal weight women to experience subfertility. Overweight and obese women were 35% and 67% more likely to experience subfertility, respectively. Obese men were 69% more likely to experience subfertility than normal weight men.\n*   Miscarriage: Overweight and obese women were 49% and 44% more likely to associated with miscarriage, respectively, than normal weight women.\n\nIN PRACTICE:\n------------\n\nThe authors concluded that "Optimising BMI from the preconception period onwards in women and men might be an important strategy to improve fertility and pregnancy outcomes."\n\nSOURCE:\n-------\n\nThe corresponding author is Vincent W.V. Jaddoe, MD, of Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The study appeared in _JAMA Network Open_.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n------------\n\nLimitations included a potential lack of generalisability of the findings because of differences between included and excluded couples.\n\nDISCLOSURES:\n------------\n\nNone of the authors reported conflicts of interest.

The mid-stage trials, part of NIH‚Äôs Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, will join six other RECOVER studies currently enrolling participants across the United States testing treatments to address viral persistence, neurological symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction (like brain fog) and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. The new trials will enroll approximately 1,660 people across 50 study sites to investigate potential treatments for some of the most frequent and burdensome symptoms reported by people suffering from long COVID.\n\n‚ÄúThe group of symptoms these trials will try to alleviate are truly disruptive and devastating for so many people struggling with long COVID,‚Äù said Walter J. Koroshetz, M.D., director of NIH‚Äôs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and co-lead of the RECOVER Initiative. ‚ÄúWhen people can‚Äôt get reliable sleep, can‚Äôt exert themselves and feel sick following tasks that used to be simple, the physical and mental anguish can lead to feelings of utter helplessness. We urgently need to come up with answers to help those struggling with long COVID feel whole again.‚Äù\n\n### RECOVER-SLEEP clinical trials will soon begin enrolling participants and include:\n\n*   A trial to test two drugs (modafinil and solriamfetol) approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat people who have problems staying awake during the day, known as hypersomnia. These medications are well-known but have not been studied widely in people with long COVID. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the active study drug or a placebo control for eight to 10 weeks, depending on the assigned study drug.\n*   A trial to test potential treatments for complex sleep disturbances due to long COVID, including melatonin, an over-the-counter supplement commonly used to treat people with sleep disorders and general insomnia; and light therapy, which is used to help people reset their sleep cycles. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either melatonin or a placebo control, and either high-intensity (active) light therapy or low-intensity (placebo) light therapy for eight weeks.\xa0\n\n### RECOVER-ENERGIZE clinical trials will soon begin enrolling participants and include:\n\n*   A trial to test a program that combines exercise training, strength and flexibility training, education, and social support, collectively known as personalized cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. The program is designed to help people who experience exercise intolerance with symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise after having COVID-19. \xa0All participants in RECOVER-ENERGIZE trials will be screened for PEM. Participants who are identified as having PEM, via a validated PEM questionnaire, will not be included in this trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either personalized cardiopulmonary rehabilitation or basic exercise education for three months.\n*   A trial to test a program known as structured pacing, which is designed to help participants with PEM identify, control, and minimize symptoms that developed after having COVID-19 by regulating or pacing their daily activities. Currently, structured pacing is the only intervention used to treat PEM. The trial will not include any exercise training or physical movement to protect participants from developing worsened symptoms of PEM. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either structured pacing with a trained coach or basic PEM education for three months.\n\nAll four trials were developed using comprehensive feedback from the community and in close partnership with patient representatives, whose insights were especially important for the PEM trial. The PEM trial was developed to address concerns expressed by patient advocacy groups about patient safety, and to better understand how this study program may help improve PEM symptoms.\n\n‚ÄúStructured pacing is currently the only intervention used to prevent post-exertional malaise, so we hope to test its effectiveness and determine how to best guide patients regarding activity management,‚Äù said Lucinda Bateman, M.D., an expert in PEM and founder of the Bateman Horne Center, Salt Lake City, a facility specializing in treating people with ME/CFS, long COVID and fibromyalgia.\n\nDiversity among trial participants is a high priority for the RECOVER Initiative. To support diverse and inclusive representation, study sites are chosen based on geographic location, their connection to communities, and track record for enrolling diverse research participants. Teams at the selected study sites will recruit participants from their health systems and surrounding communities.\n\nSites currently activated for each trial can be found on [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) (RECOVER-SLEEP\xa0[NCT06404086](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06404086),\xa0[NCT06404099](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06404099),\xa0[NCT06404112](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06404112) and RECOVER-ENERGIZE [NCT06404047](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06404047?cond=Long%20COVID&term=RECOVER-ENERGIZE&rank=1),\xa0[NCT06404060](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06404060?cond=Long%20COVID&term=RECOVER-ENERGIZE&rank=2),\xa0[NCT06404073](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06404073?cond=Long%20COVID&term=RECOVER-ENERGIZE&rank=3)). New sites will be added to clinicaltrials.gov as they begin enrolling participants.\n\nWith the launch of these four studies, RECOVER is currently testing 13 treatments across eight clinical trials and continues to enroll participants.

Neurology. 2024;doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000209805.\n\nThe findings align with recent research that linked sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor use to a 35% to 52% decrease in risk for several types of dementia compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor use.\n\nAccording to Hae Kyung Kim, MD, from the Yonsei University College of Medicine in South Korea, and colleagues, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease risk factors like diabetes, obesity and hypertension, ‚Äúwhich may have a positive impact on neurodegenerative disorders,‚Äù they wrote.\n\nAs a result, SGLT2 inhibitors could be a ‚Äúpromising option‚Äù to combat the risks for neurogenerative diseases, but little clinical research has been done on the inhibitors and neurologic outcomes, Kim and colleagues added.\n\nIn the analysis, the researchers used data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database to form a sample of 1,348,362 participants aged 40 years and older with type 2 diabetes who started taking antidiabetic drugs between 2014 and 2019.\n\nThey proceeded to conduct 1:1 propensity matching between users of SGLT2 inhibitors with users of other oral antidiabetic drugs, producing a cohort of 358,862 participants (mean age, 57 years; 57.9% men).\n\nIncidence of Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia and Parkinson‚Äôs disease served as the study‚Äôs primary outcome measurements, whereas the secondary outcomes included the incidence of all-cause dementia and a composite of all-cause dementia and Parkinson‚Äôs disease.\n\nAt a mean follow-up of 2.8 years, 6,837 incidences of dementia or Parkinson‚Äôs disease occurred in the final cohort.\n\nResearchers reported risk reductions associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use, with a 6-month drug use lag period, of:\n\n* 19% for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (adjusted HR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76-0.87);\n* 31% for vascular dementia (aHR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.6-0.78); and\n* 20% for Parkinson‚Äôs disease (aHR = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91).\n\nAdditionally, the analysis found SGLT2 inhibitor use linked to a 21% reduced risk for all-cause dementia (aHR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.9) and a 22% lower risk for all-cause dementia and Parkinson‚Äôs disease (aHR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.73‚Äì0.83) compared with the use of other oral antidiabetic drugs.\n\nThe significance for associations between SGLT2 inhibitors and reduced risk for neurogenerative disorders remained after adjusting for several factors, such as diabetes complications, medications, sex, comorbidities or bioclinical variables.\n\nThere are multiple mechanisms that contribute to SGLT2 inhibitors‚Äô ‚Äúdisease-modifying potential,‚Äù according to Kim and colleagues.\n\nFor example, ‚Äúfasting mimicry by [SGLT2 inhibitors] augments ketogenesis, and ketone bodies function as antioxidants and alternative energy substrates to glucose in the brain, which alleviates neuronal metabolic dysfunction,‚Äù they wrote.\n\nThe action of SGLT2 inhibitors ‚Äúthat mimics a fasting-like metabolic paradigm by inducing glycosuria and urinary caloric loss may partly underlie neuroprotective potential‚Äù of the drugs, they added.\n\nThe researchers noted that including users of all other oral antidiabetic drugs in the control group, instead of just users of DPP-4 inhibitors, ‚Äúmay have allowed an analysis of the impact of SGLT2 [inhibitor] use in a context more aligned with actual clinical practice, encompassing various severities of diabetes.‚Äù\n\nThey concluded that additional research is still needed ‚Äúto validate the long-term stability of these observations.‚Äù\n\nPerspective\n\nIn recent years, the use of a number of medication classes‚Äî including anticholinergics, proton pump inhibitors, opioid and nonopioid pain medications and benzodiazepines ‚Äî have been identified as increasing the risk for neurodegenerative disease. It is encouraging then to see a study that not only suggests a lack of increased risk but even a reduction of risk for patients taking certain medications.\n\nSGLT2 inhibitors have become an important part of our type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment paradigm. As noted by the Kim and colleagues, this class of medication not only provides glucose lowering benefit, but has demonstrated decreased risk of cardiovascular and renal complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nThat said, some caution in interpreting this study is warranted. First, using a homogenous population as found in the database used in this study calls into question if the results can be generalized to a more diverse population as found in the United States. Second, the relatively short duration of drug exposure of 90 days or greater and follow-up of only 5 years leaves open the questions of the duration of medication use needed to convey benefit and the duration of potential benefit or if the benefit only delays but does not prevent neurodegenerative changes. Finally, left open is the question of whether the same benefit reported in this study will be seen in a nondiabetic population.\n\nThis study is a significant first look at the question of whether SGLT-2 inhibitor use has even further risk reduction benefits beyond their cardio-renal protections. Further study is warranted to answer the important question left unanswered by this study and whether similar benefit will be gained in the nondiabetic population.\n\nKevin de Regnier, DO\n\nBoard-certified osteopathic physician specializing in family medicine  \nBoard member, American Osteopathic Association\n\n**Disclosures:** de Regnier reports no relevant financial disclosures.\n\nSources/DisclosuresCollapse\n\n**Disclosures:** Kim reports no relevant financial disclosures.

However, with different vaccines available to patients with varying surface antigen quantities and dosing strategies, understanding trends in HBsAb levels and how to optimize HBV vaccination protocols in this patient population is important but not well explored to date.\n\nTo evaluate compliance with HBV vaccination and differences in seroprotection rates among thoracic organ transplant candidates receiving different HBV vaccines, investigators conducted a retrospective study of adult heart and/or lung transplant candidates who received HBV vaccination at Mayo Clinic sites in Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida between January 2018 and August 2023. Patients were categorized into 3 groups at the time of pretransplant evaluation:\n\n*   HBV infected: HBsAg+ or anti-HBc+ (Group 1)\n*   HBV immune: Anti-HBc‚àí, HBsAb ‚â• 10 IU/L (Group 2)\n*   HBV non-immune: Anti-HBc‚àí, HBsAb < 10 IU/L (Group 3)\n\nInvestigators noted HBV vaccination was not offered to patients in Group 1 and Group 2 per institutional protocol. Conventional recombinant hepatitis B vaccines (Recombivax HB 40 mcg/mL, 3-dose series at 0, 1, and 6 months) were used before 2020 and CpG-adjuvanted recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Heplisav-B, 2-dose series at 0, 1 month) was used after 2020. Following pretransplant evaluation, patients received vaccines within Mayo Clinic institutions or from local providers.\n\nInvestigators collected hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) ‚â• 1 month after HBV vaccine completion and categorized results into 3 categories: HBsAb < 10 IU/L; HBsAb between 10 and 99 IU/L; and HBsAb > 100 IU/L. Loss of HBV seroprotection was defined as HBsAb < 10 IU/L at 30 days after transplantation, a time frame investigators chose because HBsAb was checked uniformly at this point in their institution.\n\nDuring the study period, infectious disease consultants evaluated 1164 patients, 48 (4%) of whom had HBV infection (Group 1) and 194 (17%) of whom had seroprotection against HBV (Group 2). The remaining 922 patients were eligible for HBV vaccination, most of whom were male (69%), White (80%), heart transplant candidates (53%), and evaluated by infectious disease clinic at outpatient basis (79%).\n\nAmong the 922 patients eligible for HBV vaccination, 430 (47%) patients completed the HBV vaccine series pretransplant, 299 (32%) did not receive any HBV vaccine, and 193 (21%) patients did not complete the HBV vaccine series. Investigators pointed out patients who received Heplisav-B were more likely to complete the vaccine series than Recombivax HB (81% vs 60%; P <.001), as were patients who were evaluated for infectious diseases in outpatient settings (57% vs 5% in inpatient settings; P <.001).\n\nOf 322 patients who had their HBsAb level checked ‚â• 1 month after completing the HBV vaccine series, 224 achieved HBV seroprotection. Among this group, 163 (51%) patients completed Recombivax HB and 159 (49%) completed Heplisav-B. Investigators noted that compared with patients who completed Recombivax HB, patients who completed Heplisav-B had a higher rate of seroprotection (75% vs 64%; P = .023).\n\nA total of 145 thoracic organ transplant recipients achieved HBV seroprotection at the date of transplantation. In univariate analysis, female sex, non-obesity, no steroid exposure, and receiving Heplisav-B were significant factors linked to achieving HBV seroprotection. However, multivariate logistic regression analysis identified a single independent predictor for HBV seroprotection: receiving Heplisav-B (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.723; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.056‚Äì2.810; P .029).\n\nOn the day of transplantation, 69 (48%) patients had HBsAb levels ‚â• 100 IU/L, while 76 (52%) had HBsAb levels between 10 and 100 IU/L. By 30 days after transplantation, investigators noted HBV seroprotection loss occurred in 38 (26%) recipients and was more frequent in patients with HBsAb between 10 and 100 IU/L at D0 than those with HBsAb ‚â• 100 IU/L at D0 (46% vs 4%; P <.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified age ‚â• 60 years (aOR, 2.503; 95% CI, 1.026‚Äì6.107; P = .044), and pretransplant HBsAb level between 10 and 100 IU/L (aOR, 18.575; 95% CI, 5.211‚Äì66.209; P <.001) as predictors of HBV seroprotection loss at 30 days posttransplant.\n\nInvestigators outlined multiple limitations to these findings, including the retrospective study design with a standardized timeframe for checking HBsAb levels after vaccine completion; potential underestimation of vaccine compliance due to patients not reporting vaccination received from local providers; and the lack of consideration for the longevity of HBV seroprotection, as HBsAb levels were only measured 30 days after transplantation.\n\n‚ÄúAlthough less than half of thoracic organ transplant candidates completed HBV vaccine series pretransplant, Heplisav-B provided a higher vaccine completion rate and seroprotection than the 3-dose Recombivax HB,‚Äù investigators concluded. ‚ÄúClinicians should also be aware of the increased loss of HBV seroprotection in thoracic organ transplant recipients with age ‚â• 60 years and pretransplant HBsAb between 10 and 100 IU/L.‚Äù\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Ipsen acquired rights to odevixibat when it bought Albireo last year in a $42-per-share deal worth around $950 million.\n\nThe ALGS approval is based on the results of the ASSERT trial, which showed a statistically significant reduction in itching scores compared to placebo over six months and, according to Ipsen, is the only phase 3 study completed in the disease to date.\n\n"ALGS is a distressing condition, which often presents in the first few months of life," said Professor Henkjan Verkade of the University of Groningen, Beatrix Children\'s Hospital and University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands.\n\n"One of the most common symptoms reported, as a result of the condition, is severe pruritus, with children scratching to the point of bleeding and the itch causing sleep disturbances for the child and their carers," he added. "To have a new treatment option that has been shown to reduce the itch and improve sleep is a very positive development for the ALGS community."\n\nIqirvo for primary biliary cholangitis\n\nThe new approval is the second for Ipsen\'s liver disease portfolio in a matter of days, coming after its Iqirvo (elafibranor) product was cleared by the European Commission as the first new treatment for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in nearly a decade.\n\nThe PPAR alpha/delta agonist can be used in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as a monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA.\n\nPBC is a chronic, autoimmune disease ‚Äì mostly affecting women ‚Äì in which bile ducts in the liver are gradually destroyed, leading to cirrhosis. Analysts have suggested that the market for drugs to treat UDCA-refractory PBC could be worth $1.5 billion or more per year.', 'gpt-4o-mini']

Bryant was chief digital information officer at Guy‚Äôs and St Thomas‚Äô NHS Foundation Trust and King‚Äôs College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in June 2024 when Synnovis was targeted. She said that the NHS and its suppliers need to embrace two-factor authentication to prevent cyber attacks.\n\nThe cyber attack on pathology provider Synnovis could have been prevented by two-factor authentication, according to Beverley Bryant, strategic advisor in the frontline digitisation team at NHS England. Speaking at the HETT conference on 24 September 2024, in a session titled ‚ÄòBest practice in cyber security: Achieving excellence in the health and care sector‚Äô, Bryant said that two-factor authentication ‚Äúis the single biggest deterrent we can put in‚Äù to ensure trusts are more cyber resilient and minimise the risk of attack.\n\nBryant was joint chief digital information officer at Guy‚Äôs and St Thomas‚Äô NHS Foundation Trust and King‚Äôs College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in June 2024, when Synnovis was hit by a ransomware attack, which disrupted services in south east London and led to thousands of appointments and operations being postponed.\n\nShe described the three months of disruption after the cyber attack as ‚Äúunbelievable‚Äù and said that if two-factor authentication was in place ‚Äúthe cyber attack may not have happened‚Äù.\n\nAlthough Bryant said that clinicians sometimes moan about two-factor authentication, she added that ‚Äúthey soon get over it‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs something we [the NHS] should really push‚Äù.\n\nShe also said that hospital boards should prepare for potential cyber attacks by planning for three to six months‚Äô down time, including how drug rounds would be run, and what legal and contractual mechanisms would be in place if third party suppliers go down.\n\nBryant, who will join University Hospitals Dorset NHS Foundation Trust as chief digital officer in October 2024, believes that the NHS has ‚Äúmoved into a new era of awareness and prioritisation‚Äù around cyber security, but said that the NHS supply chain still faces issues.\n\nAlso speaking in the session were Nasser Arif, cyber security manager at London North West University Healthcare and Hillingdon Hospitals NHS Trust, Saira Ghafur, lead for digital health at the Institute for Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London, and Daniel O‚ÄôShaughnessy, head of programme delivery at Better Security, Better Care.\n\nO‚ÄôShaughnessy said: ‚ÄúIt is an example of the strength [of the NHS‚Äô cyber approach] that even some of the worst actors in the world are coming in through the supply chain rather than directly through hospital trusts. I think it is something we should celebrate‚Äù.\n\nNHS England and the National Data Guardian announced an updated cyber resilience framework for health and social care organisations, starting from 2 September 2024. The change will see the NHS Data Security and Protection Toolkit gradually transition from using the NDG‚Äôs 10 data security standards to the National Cyber Security Centre‚Äôs cyber assessment framework (CAF) as its underpinning assessment mechanism.', 'gpt-4o-mini']
